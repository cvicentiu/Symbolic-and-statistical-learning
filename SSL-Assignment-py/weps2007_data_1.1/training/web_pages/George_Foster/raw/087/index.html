<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>In Summary:</u></b>&nbsp; Although George
P. Foster was foremost a very talented gunsmith and machinist, it appears
he was a skilled woodworker as well. In the 1843 Taunton advertisement
posted, he mentions making patterns for castings which would have been
very exacting work . It has been brought to our attention that there is
at least one other plane stamped only G.P.Foster, which we have neither
located nor examined.&nbsp; We also have documents establishing a relationship
between George P. Foster and Samuel Cummings which will be added to this
page very soon. It is also our opinion that in all probability, this is
the same Foster whose "Rifling Machine" was made exclusively by William
T. Nicholson. (see Nicholson File Co./ W.T.Nicholson Ad) G.P.Foster has
been included under our RI planemakers for lack of a better category at
this time.&nbsp;</font></td>
