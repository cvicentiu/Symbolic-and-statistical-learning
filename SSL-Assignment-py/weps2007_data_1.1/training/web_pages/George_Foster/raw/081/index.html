man who history forgot</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">By JOE BLACKSTOCK&nbsp; COLUMNIST</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">There aren't any monuments or statues honoring
George Foster Robinson, and you'll rarely find him in even the most detailed
history book. But on one dark day in the nation's history, he became an
American hero. Robinson, who spent the last years of his life in Pomona,
was thrust into the limelight on the night of the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln, 139 years ago tonight.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">Robinson wasn't at Ford's Theater on the night
of April 14, 1865, when John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln. Only a few blocks
away, he fought off another assassin trying to kill Secretary of State
William H. Seward as part of a conspiracy to bring the government to its
knees.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">A 32-year-old Union sergeant, Robinson was
recovering from battlefield wounds when he was temporarily assigned as
an attendant to Seward. The secretary was bedridden because of injuries
received when a carriage overturned 10 days before.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">Lewis Payne, a Booth co-conspirator, burst
into Seward's home about 10 p.m. Robinson struggled with Payne before being
struck in the head with the handle of his large knife. Stunned and bleeding,
Robinson rose up and jumped on the assassin who was stabbing Seward. After
a struggle, in which Robinson was cut in the back, Payne escaped. Roninson
and Seward's daughter then managed to stem the flow of blood from the secretary's
wounds.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">Payne, who was captured shortly after the attack,
was part of a conspiracy in the days after the end of the Civil War to
kill not only Lincoln and Seward but also Vice President Andrew Johnson
and General Ulysses S. Grant. Attacks on the latter two did not go forward.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">Payne -- who was also known as Lewis Powell
-- was a native Alabaman who fought for the Confederacy. He was captured
at Gettysburg, later escaped and was recruited into the circle of Southerners
planning the assault on Washington leaders.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">Payne and other accused conspirators were tried
- Robinson testified at the trial - and on July 7 were hanged. Both Seward
and Robinson recovered from the wounds inflicted in the attack.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">For those few moments on April 14, the spotlight
was turned on the previously undistinguished Robinson. Born in tiny Hartford,
Maine, he had been educated at two colleges before returning to work in
his father's farming and lumber interests near Island Falls in northern
Maine. Midway through the Civil War, Robinson enlisted in Company B of
the 8th Maine Volunteer Infantry. On May 20, 1864, he was wounded in the
knee at the Battle of Petersburg near Richmond, Virginia, and spent much
of the next year in Washington-area hospitals before being assigned as
Seward's aide.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">His heroics did not go unrewarded. He became
a clerk in the War Department, until the Maine Legislature petitioned Congress
asking that their favorite son be honored in a more appropriate way. In
1871, Robinson was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the same national
award given notables from Thomas Edison to Rosa Parks to Tony Blair. In
addition to awarding him the specially crafted $2,000 gold medal, the House
of Representatives voted Robinson $5,000 in cash, "commemorative of (his)
heroic conduct"</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">As a bonus, he was promoted to Major and given
a position as Paymaster of the Army. It was while serving in that capacity
that Robinson first visited Southern California. In 1892, he bought 20
acres of orange trees on the east side of today's Towne Avenue in Pomona,
a ranch his son Edmund operated.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">In 1896, Robinson retired from the military
and moved with his wife Aurora to a Pomona house at 245 East Pasadena Street.
The old soldier died at home of pneumonia at age 75 on August 16, 1907.
He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C., next
to Aurora, who died in January 1922.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">In 1965, on the centennial of the attacks on
Lincoln and Seward, Congress named Mount Sergeant Robinson, a 10,415-foot
peak about 90 miles northeast of Anchorage, Alaska. The selection of a
mountain in that state was in part because Seward, two years after Robinson
saved his life, brokered the purchase of Alaska from Russia.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Also in 1965, the Maine Civil War Centennial Commission renamed May Mountain
near Island Falls as Robinson Mountain.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">But despite these honors long ago, Robinson
remains almost anonymous as neither his birthplace in Maine nor his last
hometown of Pomona having any marker or remembrance of his heroic actions.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">Even the Internet has contributed toward obscuring
his memory. The clerk of the House of Representatives lists on a Web site
a short biography of those who have received the Congressional Gold Medal.
In this Web site, Robinson is listed as having been born in Ohio in 1844
and dying there in 1917.&nbsp; The Web site has somehow mixed him up with
a George Foreman Robinson, a distinguished lawyer, Union soldier and mayor
of Ravenna, Ohio, according to the Ravenna Library. That Robinson, though
twice a Civil War prisoner of war himself, never received the prestigious
gold medal.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#333300">For George Foster Robinson -- a national hero
with a gold medal and his name on two mountains -- fame has been very much
fleeting. Note: Great assistance in the research of this column came from
the tireless efforts of Tim Cooper of the Buckfield Historical Society
in Maine. Historian&nbsp; Lorraine Parsons of Canton, Maine; Lisa Friedman
of the Daily Bulletin's Washington bureau, Bruce Guter of the Pomona Public
Library, and the reference desks of the Upland and San Francisco public
libraries were also invaluable in this work.</font></b><b><font color="#333300"></font></b>

<hr WIDTH="100%">On the hallway's other wall is a history of United States
Mints and an exhibition featuring the nearly 300 people who have been awarded
Congressional gold medals (most of which were minted in Philadelphia).
The first gold medal was awarded to George Washington. All Presidents and
many military heroes have received gold medals, which show a likeness of
the recipient. Gold medals have also been awarded to a diverse list of
Great Americans, including Jesse Owens, John Wayne, Bob Hope, Marian Anderson,
Walt Disney, Jonas Salk, Lady Bird Johnson, Joe Louis, Elie Wiesel, Matthew
Perry, Robert Frost, and Harry Chapin.</font></b>

<br><b><font color="#333300">There is also one for George Foster Robinson,
whose story deserves to be told. He was a wounded Civil War soldier assigned
to protect&nbsp; Lincoln's Secretary of State William Seward (the man who
negotiated the purchase of Alaska) in 1865. On the fateful night Lincoln
was assassinated, Seward was also targeted for assassination. Lewis Powell&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#333300">&nbsp;broke into the Secretary's quarters
and rushed in on the sleeping Seward. Robinson interceded and though stabbed
numerous times, managed to thwart the assailant and save Seward's life.

coins. The medal honoring George F. Robinson, the hero of the night of
April 14, 1865, who stopped a co-conspirator of John Wilkes Booth's from
killing Seward, measures 77 millimeters in diameter. That is more than
twice the diameter of a Morgan dollar.</font></b>
