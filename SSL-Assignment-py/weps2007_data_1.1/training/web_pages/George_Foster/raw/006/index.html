<P><STRONG>FOSTER AT A GLANCE:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>A fourth-year tackle who is one of the largest Broncos linemen in franchise history and has steadily developed into a key member of one of the NFL&#8217;s top offensive lines. 
<LI>Started on an offensive line in 2005 that helped the Broncos post the second-most rushing yards (2,539) in franchise history and rank second in the NFL in that category (158.7 ypg.) while setting a team record for most rushing first downs (145). 
<LI>Contributed to the Broncos allowing the second-fewest sacks (38) in the NFL since he became a full-time starter in 2004 and has helped the club rank second in the league in total rushing yards (4,872) during that period. 
<LI>Made an excellent transition to right tackle in 2004, starting every game at the position after beginning his NFL career on the left side of the offensive line. 
<LI>Played every snap on an offensive line in 2004 that set a Broncos record by allowing only 15 sacks, shattering the previous best of 22 sacks set in 1971, to rank third in the NFL. 
<LI>Helped Denver post its sixth-highest season rushing total (2,333 yds.) at the time in 2004 and produce the franchise&#8217;s fifth 1,000-yard back in the last 10 years (Reuben Droughns, 1,240 yds.). 
<LI>Appeared in only Denver's final regular-season game as a rookie in 2003. 
<LI>Started for two seasons at the University of Georgia. 
<LI>Selected by the Broncos in the first round (20th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>CAREER TRANSACTIONS:</STRONG> Signed by Denver as a draft choice 7/25/03.</P>
<P><STRONG>2006 Regular Season:</STRONG> <FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>He started on an offensive line that paved the way for Tatum Bell&#8217;s 103-yard rushing performance at Stl. (9/10). He started on an offensive line that did not allow a sack and blocked for 145 rushing yards in the home opener vs. K.C. (9/17). He cleared the way for Tatum Bell&#8217;s 100-yard outing and helped the team not yield a sack at N.E. (9/24). As a starter, he contributed to an offensive line that cleared the way for 116 rushing yards and yielded only one sack on Monday Night Football vs. Bal. (10/9). He started on an offensive line that cleared the way for 144 rushing yards, including 83 yards by Tatum Bell, while yielding only two sacks on Sunday Night Football vs. Oak. (10/15). He helped block for Tatum Bell&#8217;s 115-yard outing at Cle. (10/22). He started on an offensive line that allowed only one sack and paved the way for the team&#8217;s 227 rushing yards, including Mike Bell&#8217;s 136-yard output vs. Ind. (10/29). He contributed as a starter on an offensive line that yielded only one sack at Pit. (11/5). He saw action on special teams as Adam Meadows replaced him in the starting lineup at Oak. (11/12). He remained on special teams on Sunday Night Football vs. S.D. (11/19). After Meadows left the game with a hamstring injury in the first quarter, he returned to the offensive line on Thanksgiving at K.C. (11/23). He returned to the starting lineup as Meadows was inactive with a hamstring injury for the game on Sunday Night Football vs. Sea. (12/3). Tatum Bell amassed a career-high 133 rushing yards against the Seahawks, including 112 in the first half. He remained in the starting lineup at S.D. (12/10) due to Meadows&#8217; hamstring injury and helped block for Tatum Bell&#8217;s 116-yard outing. Bell&#8217;s 100-yard outing was the first surrendered by the Chargers to a visitor in 20 home games, the league&#8217;s second-longest streak spans to Week 2 of the 2004 campaign. As a starter, he helped limit the Cardinals to one sack at Ari. (12/17). He remained in the starting lineup and helped clear the way for 101 rushing yards in the second half and 127 in the game vs. Cin. (12/24).</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>2005 Postseason:</STRONG> Started at tackle in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. New England (1/14/06) to help hand the Patriots their first postseason loss in 11 games. Started at tackle in the AFC Championship Game vs. Pittsburgh (1/22/06).</P>
<P><STRONG>2005:</STRONG> Foster started all 16 regular-season games and both playoff games for the Broncos at right tackle, paving the way for one of the NFL&#8217;s most productive offenses. Denver posted its second-best single-season rushing total (2,539) on the fourth-most attempts in team history, paced by Mike Anderson&#8217;s 1,014 yards, and ranked second in the NFL in rushing (158.7 ypg.). The line allowed the third-fewest sacks (23) in the league and team annals and helped Denver set a franchise record with 145 rushing first downs. Foster also was a key component in the Broncos being just the third team in league history to have two 900+yard rushers (Anderson and Tatum Bell), a 1,000-yard receiver (Rod Smith) and a 3,000-yard passer (Jake Plummer) in the same season. On Monday Night Football vs. K.C. (9/26), the line allowed only one sack and cleared the way for 221 rushing yards. Foster and his linemates helped Anderson top the 100-yard rushing plateau for the first time in 2005 at Jac. (10/2) and helped Bell reach the mark vs. Was. (10/9), a game in which Denver did not allow a sack. The line blocked for the team&#8217;s third consecutive individual 100-yard game when Bell gained 114 yards vs. N.E. (10/16). The team also allowed only one sack to the Patriots. Anderson posted 120 yards at NYG (10/23) for the team&#8217;s fourth consecutive individual 100-yard rushing performance with the line not allowing a sack to the Giants. The following week vs. Phi. (10/30), the Broncos became the first team in NFL history to have two 100-yard rushers (Anderson and Bell) and a 300-yard passer (Plummer) in the same game. Against the Eagles, the team gained a staggering 564 total yards, the second-most in franchise history (567, 10/31/04 vs. Atl.) and 49 points, the second-most in franchise history (50, 10/6/63 vs. San Diego). Denver did not allow a sack at Oak. (11/13) and cleared the path for 196 rushing yards (113 by Anderson) vs. NYJ (11/20). Foster contributed to an offensive line that paved the way for 144 rushing yards in a Thanksgiving Day win at Dal. (11/24). The line blocked for a rushing attack that recorded 178 yards and allowed just one sack at Buf. (12/17). In the regular-season finale at S.D. (12/31), the offensive line handled the league&#8217;s top-ranked rushing defense (79.5 yds. per game) as the Broncos amassed 157 rushing yards.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>2004:</STRONG> Foster adjusted well to his first season at right tackle with the Broncos after spending his rookie year working on the left side of the offensive line. He started all 16 regular-season games at right tackle and did not miss an offensive snap on a line that set a franchise record by allowing only 15 sacks, shattering the previous best of 22 sacks set in 1971, to rank third in the NFL. The offensive line did not surrender a sack in eight contests and blocked for a 100-yard rusher in eight different games, including a stretch that yielded a 100-yard rushing game by a Bronco in six of seven games midway through the year. Despite season-ending injuries to the Broncos' top two running backs early in the year, Denver totaled the franchise's sixth-best single-season rushing total (2,333 yds.) behind the strong play of its offensive line. Additionally, the line helped three different Broncos (Reuben Droughns, Tatum Bell and Quentin Griffin) rush for at least 100 yards in a game during the regular season to mark only the second time in franchise history such a feat has occurred. In the first playoff action of his career, Foster started at right tackle in Denver's AFC Wild Card Game at Ind. (1/9). He made his first NFL start at right tackle in Denver's season opener vs. K.C. (9/12) and was part of a blocking effort that paved the way for Griffin to set a franchise record for most rushing yards in a season opener with a game-high 156 yards along with two rushing touchdowns. Foster held defensive end Julius Peppers without a sack vs. Car. (10/10) and helped Droughns post the ninth-highest single-game rushing total (193 yards) by a Bronco in franchise history during the regular season. Foster and the offensive line did not allow a sack for the third time in 2004 at Oak. (10/17) in addition to clearing paths for Denver's dominating run game, which accounted for a season-high 254 yards on 51 carries (4.9 avg.). Foster was a part of franchise history vs. Atl. (10/31) in protecting Jake Plummer as he recorded the most passing yards in a single game in team history (ninth in NFL history) with 499 yards.</P>
<P><STRONG>2003:</STRONG> Selected by the Broncos in the first round (20th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft, Foster&#8217;s development was slowed with a sprained right foot suffered during the first day of training camp. He was declared inactive for the first 15 games before seeing his first NFL action at left tackle in a reserve role in the final week of the season at G.B. (12/28). He was inactive for the Broncos&#8217; AFC Wild Card game at Ind. (1/4).</P>
<P><STRONG>COLLEGE:</STRONG> In 43 career games at the University of Georgia (10 starts), Foster was regarded as the Bulldogs' best combination blocker with his pass and running blocking skills. The two-year starter provided valuable leadership and depth to the offensive line with his ability to play either tackle position. Foster saw his senior season hindered after suffering a right wrist injury in a car accident in August 2002 but returned to the lineup for the final nine games of the season and was effective blocking with a large cast. As a junior, Foster started the final eight games of the season at left tackle, including the Music City Bowl vs. Boston College. He helped the offense generate 4,761 yards, making 55 key blocks/knockdowns as the offensive line ranked second in the Southeastern Conference by allowing only 15 sacks. A reserve tackle as a sophomore, Foster played in every game of the regular season (12) and in Georgia&#8217;s win over Virginia in the 2000 Oahu Bowl. He played every game in 1999, earning his first career start in the Bulldogs' game against Louisiana State at right tackle. He redshirted as a freshman.</P>
<P><STRONG>PERSONAL:</STRONG> Foster attended Southeast High School in Macon, Ga., and was named Class 4-A first-team all-state by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Georgia Sports Writers Association. He was named to the Super Southern 100 and Top 50 in Georgia by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Macon Telegraph's "Sweet 16.&#8221; An all-city pick in his junior and senior seasons, Foster also earned all-Middle Georgia honors as a senior by the Macon Telegraph.
