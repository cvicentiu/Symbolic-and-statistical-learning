INTRODUCTION</P>
</B>
<P>
George Foster stands as a challenge to those anthropologists who believe that specialization
 is incompatible with breadth of view, that scientific and applied work cannot productively be 
part of one career, that historical and long time association with the same community and region
 tends to narrow comparative insight. For over forty years Foster has been writing and working 
in anthropology, and during those decades he has pursued his curiosity into a broad range of 
topics. In this paper, we recall the major contributions of an anthropologist who during a 
long career has never stopped asking interesting questions and has always followed leads that
 stimulated new insight. He has specialized, he has generalized, he has applied-all in the 
pursuit of deepening our understanding of human behavior.</P>

  </a>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"><B> </b> </a> <B><A NAME="intel"></a> INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT</b></P>
<P> We begin with this topic because Foster's personal intellectual history is 
  a remarkable instance of the ability, all too rare among senior scholars, to 
  strike out boldly in new directions. Foster was trained, at Northwestern and 
  at Berkeley, in the American historical school of Anthropology. The emphasis 
  of that school, emanating from Boas and his students, such as Kroeber, Lowie, 
  and others, was on meticulous ethnography and historical reconstruction . Like 
  all his colleagues in that generation, Foster began his work along those lines. 
  His early efforts in ethnography, based on field work in California ( <A HREF="fobib.html#1939"> 
  1939 </A> ; <A HREF="fobib.html#1944a"> 1944a </A> ) and Veracruz (<A HREF="fobib.html#1940">1940</A>;<A HREF="fobib.html#1942a"> 
  1942a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1943a">1943a</A>;<A HREF="fobib.html#1945a">1945a</A>), still stand 
  as basic sources. His historical interpretations relating to the precise origins 
  of the earliest Iberian immigrants (<A HREF="fobib.html#1951a">1951a</A>;<A HREF="fobib.html#1952a"> 
  1952a</A>) and the effect of European culture patterns on those of Latin America 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953a">1953a</A>;<A HREF="fobib.html#1954a">1954a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1960a">1960a</A>) 
  were abundantly documented, yet innovative, and stand as classic pieces in ethnohistory 
  and comparative historical reconstruction (also see <A HREF="fobib.html#1969c">1969c</A>).</P>
<P> Foster did not rest with his achievements in historical reconstruction. An 
  early interest in kinship and role behavior (<A HREF="fobib.html#1949a">1949a</A>) had 
  developed by the 1960s into a major re-examination of what social anthropology 
  was all about and into an analysis of bilateral social organization, peasant 
  society, and the interrelationships of social structure, economics, psychology, 
  and symbolic systems. All of this involved a major re-orientation and personal 
  synthesis of disparate concepts, but it did not result in the abandonment of 
  early interests, rather in their enrichment. He continues to publish detailed 
  papers on ethnographic subjects (<A HREF="fobib.html#1975b">1975b</A>), and although his 
  attention to explicit historical analysis has waned in recent years, other early 
  interests in economics, in the technical aspects of pottery making, and in applied 
  anthropology and public health have continued to flourish. No one in the history 
  of American ethnography has met the challenge of re-tooling in as effective, 
  courageous, and productive a manner as has Foster. Not only his work, but the 
  man, stand as exemplars.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="theme"></a> THEMES AND RESULTS OF RESEARCH</P>
</B> 
<P> Although Foster's research interests have shifted over time, seven major themes 
  of his work were already in evidence by about 1950: ethnography and field method; 
  historical reconstruction; peasant economics; pottery and other aspects of technology; 
  applied anthropology and development; medicine and public health; role analysis, 
  social structure and symbolic systems.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="ethno"></a> ETHNOGRAPHY AND FIELD METHOD</P>
</B> 
<P> Foster's concern with ethnographic methodology (see <A HREF="fobib.html#1951e">1951e</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1953d">1953d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1956a">1956a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1961b">1961b</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1968b">1968b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1970f">1970f</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1974a">1974a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1974d">1974d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1976c">1976c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1979a">1979a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1979b">1979b</A>) has been a constant feature of his intellectual 
  development. His emphasis on precise and meticulous recording and reporting 
  of field materials, combined with careful analysis of comparative data, is in 
  the tradition of the natural sciences. Reference has already been made to his 
  early work in California and Veracruz. The Mexican focus was renewed on the 
  basis of field work begun in late 1944 (<A HREF="fobib.html#1948a">1948a</A>). With its 
  extensions, this research forms the empirical base for a great deal of Foster's 
  later publications. First, it provided a foil for his reconnaissance of Spain 
  (see below) and thus represented part of the foundation for his major interpretive 
  summary of the effect of Iberian on Latin American culture (<A HREF="fobib.html#1960a">1960a</A>). 
  Second, the 1944-1946 field trip to Tzintzuntzan was but the earliest in a series 
  spanning the past 35 years. The results of this unparalleled set of observations 
  on a single community were published in 1967 (<A HREF="fobib.html#1967a">1967a</A>); since 
  that time Foster has continued to return to Tzintzuntzan and this experience 
  provides the basis for the forthcoming second edition of Tzintzuntzan: Mexican 
  Peasants in a Changing World (<A HREF="fobib.html#1979c">1979c</A>).</P>
<P> It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of this recording over 
  time, which is perhaps more in the tradition of astronomy than of social science. 
  Few anthropologists, to our knowledge, have assembled an equivalent record of 
  first-hand and archival data for the investigation of culture change. Indeed, 
  he played a major role-with Elizabeth Colson and Thayer Scudder-in bringing 
  together scholars with similar long-term field research experiences to discuss 
  the value of this strategy at a 1975 Burg Wartenstein conference (<A HREF="fobib.html#1976h">1976h</A>). 
  The results of this conference have recently appeared in the book Long-Term 
  Field Research in Social Anthropology (<A HREF="fobib.html#1979a">1979a</A>).</P>
<P> A careful reading of Foster's published work spanning the past 35 years discloses 
  the detail of his broad scope. He has moved from fish nets, pottery and economics 
  to the skein of social interaction, the native's perception of the social world, 
  and his symbolic expression of it. He has long understood what many anthropologists 
  today might learn-that the domain of anthropology is as wide as the activities 
  of human beings, and that this domain need not be confined to the primitive, 
  the isolated, the exotic.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="histo"></a> HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION</P>
</B> 
<P> An early interest in reconstruction is evident in a work on the origins of 
  maize (<A HREF="fobib.html#1947b">1947b</A>) and in his first ethnographic </P>
<P> treatment of the history and culture of Tzintzuntzan (<A HREF="fobib.html#1948a">1948a</A>). 
  By the early 1950s, this interest had become comparative, with one of the first 
  thorough reconnaissances of a European area by an American anthropologist (<A HREF="fobib.html#1951a">1951a</A>) 
  . This field survey of Spanish peasant culture resulted in an important ethnohistorical 
  essay on the places of origin of Spanish niigrants to the New World (1 952a), 
  a comparison of Iberian and Latin American medical beliefs (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953b">1953b</A>), 
  and a preliminary statement on the anthropological aspects of imperial conquest 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1954a">1954a</A>). A major work, Culture and Conquest (<A HREF="fobib.html#1960a">1960a</A>), 
  followed, detailing the historical relationships between the parent Iberian 
  and the filial American cultures, and their confluences, segment by segment. 
  Foster's ideas regarding the crystallization of a "conquest culture" are of 
  great theoretical importance, applicable far beyond the immediately contributing 
  corpus of American materials. They have special relevance to the impact of U.S. 
  culture on many underdeveloped nations around the world, particularly in areas 
  of American military and touristic presence.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="econo"></a> PEASANT ECONOMY</P>
</B> <A NAME="econo"></a> 
<P> Foster has made many significant contributions to the study of peasant societies, 
  beginning with his classic paper on "folk culture" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953c">1953c</A>). 
  In particular, his ideas about the "dyadic contract" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1961a">1961a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1963">1963</A>) and "the image of limited good" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1965a">1965a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1972b">1972b</A>) have been found to have wide relevance in understanding 
  more generally how people behave under conditions of scarcity. Again, however, 
  as an explicit subject for empirical investigation, this interest was evident 
  in several early works (<A HREF="fobib.html#1942a">1942a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1942b">1942b</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1944b">1944b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1948a">1948a</A> ; <A HREF="fobib.html#1948b">1948b</A>; 
  etc). Which provided Foster with a solid foundation for the development of his 
  theoretical orientations focusing on scarcity, as well as his interests in economic 
  development and applied cultural change. Foster's concept of "limited good" 
  continues to inspire a great deal of research and growing interest-as reflected 
  in the articles by Zarrugh, Wagner, and Gamst in this volume-especially as we 
  in the United States begin to experience scarcity in the areas of natural and 
  human resources.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="techno"></a> POTTERY AND TECHNOLOGY</P>
</B> <A NAME="techno"></a> 
<P> Like his interest in economics, this is related to Foster's concern with development 
  and to his later theories regarding the cultural consequences of a finite resource 
  base. It resulted, however, in a kind of sub-field of its own-examination of 
  pottery techniques and analysis of the social structure of potters around the 
  world. His early descriptions of Mexican potters (<A HREF="fobib.html#1948a">1948a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1948b">1948d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1955a">1955a</A>) were followed by others 
  from places as distant as Bengal (<A HREF="fobib.html#1956c">1956c</A>) and the Philippines 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1956d">1956d</A>), and his early historical interests crop up in 
  his discussion of the relationship between mold- and wheel-made pottery (<A HREF="fobib.html#1959a">1959a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1959b">1959b</A>), and again in two important contributions of ethnography 
  to archaeology (<A HREF="fobib.html#1960c">1960c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1960d">1960d</A>). A new 
  turn in his interests, toward social structure and away from history, emerged 
  in two later papers on the sociology of pottery (1965d) and on the role of contemporary 
  pottery and basketry in Middle America (<A HREF="fobib.html#1967e">1967e</A>).</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B> 
<P><A NAME="apply"></a> APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</P>
</B> <A NAME="apply"></a> 
<P> Much of Foster's interest in this field stems from his early association with 
  the Institute of Social Anthropology at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1946d">1946d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1947a">1947a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1948h">1948h</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1950b">1950b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1951d">1951d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1967f">1967f</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1979d">1979d</A>) and from his concentration on problems of acculturation 
  in Latin America. His concerns were theoretical, practical, and broadly comparative.</P>
<P> in 1948, Foster wrote a paper (<A HREF="fobib.html#1948i">1948i</A>) on intercultural 
  communication by professional experts-a subject now commonplace but scarcely 
  perceived thirty years ago. In the early 1950s, he demonstrated the common problems 
  in community development, irrespective of area, by use of the comparative method 
  (19 5 1 c; 1955c; 1955e). Foster's most widely read work on the subject of economic 
  development- Traditional Cultures and the Impact of Technological Change (<A HREF="fobib.html#1962a">1962a</A>; 
  revised edition, <A HREF="fobib.html#1973a">1973a</A>) -was for many years the "Bible" 
  of applied anthropology. This book, which has been translated into Spanish (<A HREF="fobib.html#1964d">1964d</A>), 
  Portuguese (<A HREF="fobib.html#1964e">1964e</A>), and Dutch (<A HREF="fobib.html#1966f">1966f</A>), 
  is without doubt the most widely read and influential book on applied anthropology, 
  both among anthropologists and non-anthropologists. A more recent work, Applied 
  Anthropology (<A HREF="fobib.html#1969a">1969a</A>), is more theoretical and broader in 
  its application; it should be required reading for all scientists interested 
  in shortterm or long-range action programs. Through these and other publications 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1956b">1956b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1960e">1960e</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1961c">1961c</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1964c">1964c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1968c">1968c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1970b">1970b</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1974d">1974d</A>) , Foster has done much to develop the field of applied 
  anthropology and to keep pace with the important social problems of his time.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B>
<P><A NAME="medic"></a> MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH</P>
</B> <A NAME="medic"></a> 
<P> In some ways, it is difficult to separate Foster's interest in public health 
  from that in applied anthropology. However, his specific contributions have 
  had their effect not only in the area of applying of social science knowledge 
  to practical problems, but also in the realm of culture history. His earliest 
  works, in accord with his historical concerns, were retrospective; they dealt 
  with the notion of soul-loss (<A HREF="fobib.html#1944c">1944c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1951b">1951b</A>) 
  and the application of Hippocratic humoral theories in Latin American folk medicine 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1951c">1951c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1953b">1953b</A>). In the 1950s and the 
  1960s, Foster focused on applying anthropological insight to public health problems 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1952c">1952c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1952d">1952d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1952f">1952f</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1953d">1953d</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1954b">1954b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1958a">1958a</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1961b">1961b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1966a">1966a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1966b">1966b</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1968a">1968a</A>) and his message carried far beyond anthropologists 
  and the United States. In the 1970s, Foster has continued to urge the application 
  of anthropological theory to the practical solution of medical problems (<A HREF="fobib.html#1974c">1974c</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1975c">1975c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1976b">1976b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1978c">1978c</A>), 
  but his most significant contribution has been to write-with Barbara Gallatin 
  Anderson-the first comprehensive text on the biocultural and sociocultural phenomena 
  in medical anthropology (<A HREF="fobib.html#1978a">1978a</A>). This global overview of 
  the field is balanced by his perpetual focus on Latin American folk medicine, 
  exemplified by his dissection of "Hippocrates' Latin American Legacy" as the 
  1977 Bernard Moses Memorial Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1978b">1978b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1978d">1978d</A>). In conjunction with 
  his recent paper on "Disease etiologies in non-western medical systems" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1976a">1976a</A>), 
  Foster shows an increasing interest in the logic of medical systems, a subject 
  only now beginning to receive appropriate attention from anthropologists.</P>
<P><A HREF="fobib.html#cont"> Back to Contents</A> <BR>
<B> 
<P><A NAME="symb"></a> ROLE ANALYSIS, SOCIAL STRUCTURE, AND SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS</P>
</B> <A NAME="symb"></a> 
<P> We will concentrate most of our comments on Foster's intellectual development 
  here because it is in this area that he has shown his major intellectual growth 
  and has made his most lasting theoretical contributions. We must re-emphasize 
  the magnitude of the shift in Foster's orientation, stepping as it did across 
  the major cleavages in contemporary cultural anthropology-between historicism 
  and structuralism, between empiricism and theory, and in many ways from the 
  heritage of the nineteenth century to the promise of the twentieth. The importance 
  of this shift by an anthropologist can be illustrated with a whimsical analogy: 
  it is rather like Newton, after sinking a series of neat three-cushion shots 
  in the side pocket, putting up his cue to work out the psi-function with his 
  chalk. Foster's major theoretical problem from the early 1950s onward has been 
  the nature of peasant society as held by the natives, and their symbolic expressions 
  of that view. Many of his ideas are crystallized in Peasant Society: A Reader 
  (<A HREF="fobib.html#1967b">1967b</A>), which he co-edited with two colleagues at BerkeleyJack 
  M. Potter and May N. Diaz-and which contained a number of Foster's pieces, including 
  an original essay defining "what is a peasant" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1976c">1967c</A>).</P>
<P> Apart from earlier sections in monographs, Foster's first paper on the subject 
  of peasant society was the one on voluntary organizations (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953a">1953a</A>), 
  coming directly out of his Ibero-American comparative interests. Although it 
  was largely historical and comparative, it was important in demonstrating the 
  wide range of fraternal organizations as cohesive units above the level of the 
  household in peasant society. Most anthropological analysis of higher-level 
  units had been based on lineal kinship; relatively little attention had been 
  paid to voluntary organizations. Foster's basic problem was the identification 
  of structural units and/or principles lying above the family or household but 
  below the lowest-level political or territorial unit. His solution lay not in 
  the identification of units per se (other than some voluntary organizations) 
  but rather in the identification of structural principles and symbolic devices.</P>
<P> Two papers on the dyadic contract (<A HREF="fobib.html#1961a">1961a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1963">1963</A>) 
  mark the real shift in his thinking and are among the most widely cited papers 
  in contemporary peasant studies. In them, Foster explores the tenuous but sufficient 
  linkages established by overlapping pairs of persons in a system of minimal 
  organic solidarity. The theoretical assumptions underlying this model involve 
  a finite base of resources, the natives' perception of that limitation, and 
  the natives' corollary desire to limit and solidify social linkages. Foster's 
  earlier interests in economics (<A HREF="fobib.html#1942a">1942a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1948b">1948b</A>) 
  and in community development (particularly <A HREF="fobib.html#1961c">1961c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1962a">1962a</A>) 
  blend here into a higher level theory from which much of the "dyadic contract" 
  model can be seen to now A paper (<A HREF="fobib.html#1964a">1964a</A>) closely related 
  to those of the dyadic contract (<A HREF="fobib.html#1961a">1961a</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1963">1963</A>), 
  peasant interpersonal relations (1960-1961), and peasant social networks (<A HREF="fobib.html#1969d">1969d</A>) 
  dealt with the function of speech forms in symbolizing social distance. Apart 
  from its relationship to Foster's developing theory and its earlier roots in 
  his linguistic descriptions (<A HREF="fobib.html#1948k">1948k</A>), this paper is an early 
  and independent analysis in socio-linguistics. (Foster continues his pursuit 
  of linguistic dimensions with a recently completed, and still unpublished, paper 
  entitled "Responsibility for Illness in Tzintzuntzan: A Cognitive-Linguistic 
  Anomaly").</P>
<P> In the same year that he dealt with the symbolism of speech forms, Foster 
  examined the economic implications of "treasure tales" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1964b">1964b</A>) 
  for peasant populations with finite resource bases-namely, that since available 
  goods were limited, no one could become wealthy without robbing another or discovering 
  treasure. In the next year, Foster issued his provocative statement on the "image 
  of limited good" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1965a">1965a</A>). He followed this "classic" paper 
  (reflected in its selection for reprinting in the recently issued Selected Papers 
  from the American Anthropologist, 1946-19 70 [<A HREF="fobib.html#1976e">1976e</A>] ), 
  with a series of articles on peasant world view (<A HREF="fobib.html#1965c">1965c</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1966c">1966c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1966h">1966h</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1967d">1967d</A>;

  His ideas on these topics have been hotly debated and widely cited, and remain 
  among the most controversial in the anthropological study of peasant society. 
  Although no commentators are neutral on the subject, it is curious that some 
  accuse Foster of economic determinism while others charge him with cognitive 
  determinism (see <A HREF="fobib.html#1966e">1966e</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1970c">1970c</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1972b">1972b</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1974b">1974b</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1974a">1975a</A>; and <A HREF="fobib.html#1976d">1976d</A> 
  for his responses to the critics and commentators). For example, about half 
  of the Fall 1968 issue of Human Organization, the journal of the Society for 
  Applied Anthropology, was devoted to "Perspectives on the Atomistic-Type Society". 
  Many of the articles explicitly confront-and most confirm- Foster's ideas about 
  the structure of peasant life. In summarizing the thrust of the collected papers, 
  Jerrold Levy concluded that "...Foster has emerged as the new senior theoretician 
  requiring mention in all studies of peasantry" (1968:234).</P>
<P> Perhaps the most telling criticism of Foster's theory of peasant society and 
  economics has been that his theory is more widely applicable than he was at 
  first willing to admit. As Gamst demonstrates for American railroad men in his 
  article in this volume, "limited good" ideologies and behaviors are characteristic 
  not only of peasant societies perpetually starved for resources, but also occur 
  in more advanced societies when the economy ceases to expand. Over a wide range 
  of cultures, the interpersonal behavior and symbolic expressions of people can 
  be fairly well predicted from a knowledge of the state and rate of change in 
  their economic systems. The model may be used to explain strong sanctions against 
  upward mobility and peasant inertia as well as the creation and use of leveling 
  mechanisms and the absence of cooperative behavior. The advantage of Foster's 
  formulation in explaining reluctance to engage in community enterprises, over 
  competing social scientific theories, or the once widespread colonial explanations 
  of native stupidity, laziness, and the like, are now obvious.</P>
<P> We stress again that the separate interests that have characterized Foster's 
  work have in fact been interrelated strands crossing each other repeatedly, 
  one notion fertilizing another, growth occuring both in breadth and sophistication. 
  Foster has come to be regarded as a principal figure in peasant studies, applied 
  anthropology, public health, and medical anthropology, as well as a major contributor 
  to the field of folklore (<A HREF="fobib.html#1939">1939</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1941b">1941b</A>;

  Whatever his theoretical focus, he is always recognized as a Mexicanist and 
  Latin Americanist of the top rank.</P>

<P><A NAME="other"></a> OTHER TALENTS</P>
</B> <A NAME="other"></a> 
<P> Pedagogy is, more than anything else, a matter of personality, and Foster's 
  teaching-style is perfectly in character with his research and publications. 
  His preparations for lectures are detailed and thorough, his delivery in lecture 
  or seminar well organized, precise, and solid. His standards are high, but he 
  is harder on himself than he is on the students. Its style in teaching is, one 
  might say, old-fashioned: he does not cozy up to students. Learning from Foster 
  is a no-nonsense proposition and seldom easy on the student's ego. He listens, 
  although he does not always agree. It is noteworthy that he was the first social 
  anthropologist in the Berkeley department to take students with him to the field, 
  involving them directly in his own Mexican field work.</P>
<P> He served as Acting Director of the Museum of Anthropology, and several times 
  contributed as departmental chairman and graduate advisor. It was Foster who 
  developed the system of phased steps in the graduate program, substituting meaningful 
  scrutiny for formal hurdles. He was instrumental in winning financial support 
  for graduate student fieldwork. Most recently, he has built and maintained the 
  Medical Anthropology Program, carried on jointly by UC Berkeley and the UC Medical 
  School in San Francisco. Students have benefited greatly from his organizational 
  and entrepreneurial abilities. It was Foster who took the initiative in finding 
  and keeping training grants that led to historically unheard of levels of financial 
  support for students. No member of the Berkeley department has been more diligent 
  in pursuit of its welfare. But his contributions went far beyond the Berkeley 
  academic community.</P>
<P> As a frequent consultant to governmental development and public health programs, 
  and as a participant in many scientific conferences around the world, his contribution 
  has been considerable. From 1944 to 1946, while carrying out his initial fieldwork 
  in Tzintzuntzan, Foster taught at the National School of Anthropology and History 
  in Mexico City. In the seven years following he was Director of the Institute 
  of Social Anthropology at the Smithsonian In 1954 he went to Mexico as consultant 
  on the "History of the Americas" project of the Commission on History of the 
  Pan American Institute of Geography and History. In 1951, while Director of 
  the ISA of the Smithsonian, Foster proposed to the Health Division of the Institute 
  of Inter-American Affairs that he and his Latin American colleagues investigate 
  the relationships between culture and public health innovations. This idea, 
  novel at the time but now more universally accepted, was launched by a mimeographed 
  paper, "A cross cultural analysis of a technical aid program" (<A HREF="fobib.html#1951c">1951c</A>), 
  subsequently translated into Spanish (<A HREF="fobib.html#1952g">1952g</A> and <A HREF="fobib.html#1967h">1967h</A>) 
  and summarized in Portuguese (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953h">1953h</A>; <A HREF="fobib.html#1955f">1955f</A>; 
  <A HREF="fobib.html#1958b">1958b</A>). On the basis of this preliminary effort, Foster 
  participated in a six-month-long analysis (<A HREF="fobib.html#1953d">1953d</A> and <A HREF="fobib.html#1953e">1953e</A>) 
  of the first ten years of North American-Latin American bilateral technical 
  aid programs in Latin America. Some have said that this demonstration following 
  in the wake of the ISA work, launched applied anthropology in international 
  work in its contemporary form (see Richard Adam's quote; in Foster <A HREF="fobib.html#1979e">1979e:214</A>).</P>
<P> This is but an abbreviated mention of professional service, but we should 
  mention Foster's role as President of the American Anthropological Association 
  in the volatile period of the late 1960s. He was instrumental in reorganizing 
  the A.A.A.'s administration to enable it to cope with a greatly increased membership, 
  and he played an important role in the acquisition and organization of its new 
  headquarters in Washington. All of these talents and experiences have enriched 
  his intellectual development, just as one would expect from a scholar with a 
  synthetic mind.</P>

<P><A NAME="sum"></a> SUMMARY</P>
</B> <A NAME="sum"> 
<P> George Foster's work over the past forty years-covering the fields of peasant 
  economics, material culture, folklore, linguistics, symbolism, role analysis, 
  community development, and public health-has been based on personal field work 
  and consultancies in more than a dozen countries ranging from Afghanistan to 
  Peru. As if his publication record of 21 books and monographs, more than 100 
  articles, and 45 book reviews were not sufficient, Foster has always been concerned 
  that his works be translated and reprinted so as to be accessible to scholars 
  outside of the United States and other English-speaking countries. The eagerness 
  of anthropologists and publishers to have his works is reflected in the translation 
  of more than 20 of his major books and articles into Spanish, Portuguese, and 
  other languages, as well as in the reprinting in English of nearly 30 of his 
  works. This continuing heavy demand for his ideas is also documented by Foster's 
  entries in the Social Science Citation Index. In these days when the half-life 
  of scholarly knowledge has diminished to only a few years, it is remarkable 
  to see that some of his works published over twenty-five years ago are still 
  consistently cited (personal communication from Ms. Dorothy Koenig, Librarian 
  of the Anthropology Library at Berkeley).</P>
<P> Perhaps even more impressive than the honored status of his individual works 
  is the integrity of the full corpus of Foster's scientific, academic, pedagogical, 
  and professional contributions. His career is surprisingly of a piece; nothing 
  in this record is really isolated. For example, his work on pottery is a part 
  of his interest in the economy, which blends with that on community development 
  and public health, and his interest in community development (and his perception 
  that peasants often lack such an interest) sparked investigations of role behavior, 
  worldview, and culture change. All of his research experience, professional 
  devotion, and productivity have been brought to his teaching and to his administrative 
  responsibilities in the Department and University in which he has spent the 
  last 25 years. His own intellectual development is an object lesson, and his 
  influence on students in social science has been and continues to be immeasurable.</P>
