follow-up based on incorrect reference located during an earlier
visit and is thought to be the daughter of George Howard/Eliza
Manderville. Marriage Certs 2 through 6 were follow up work to earlier visits. Birth Certs 7 through 9 were punts on offspring
from Miffling marriages found earlier in Kingston area. Finally,
Emily Howard is possibly a twin to my Grandfather - registered in

<p>The Death Certs. for Elizabeth/Eliza Howard and her son
Thomas/Tom are an attempt to find out what happened to Elizabeth
Howard (nee Standbridge) and her son Thomas after the family
moved from Wandsworth to Addlestone, following the death of
Charles in 1880s. They were last located in 1894 on the marriage cert of Daughter/Sister Mary Ann Vincent (nee Howard).</p>

<p>The Eagle Marriage's are a first step to locating the missing families to complete the Eagle
descendants of a Howard/Eagle
marriage dating back to 1860. The marriage of Rhoda Emma Eagle to
a Butt/Fallen (perhaps the most interesting of all of them given
the connections with the Bride in the Bath case) eluded me on the
day. I have checked the Marriage records from 1882 to 1912. Next
visit I plan to complete the marriage search from 1913 to 1930.
Butt is supposed to have died c. 1930.</p>

who was both deaf and dumb with whom her mother Eleanor White

that Valerie has lost contact with her brother Douglas and his
wife Sandra who continue to elude me. One clue is that they were
last known to be living in the Reading area c. 1994. By reference
to the UK-Info CD-ROM I located a Sandra P White living in the
Reading locale and am now writing to her to check whether she is
the Sandra P White I seek. One trail ends, 3 more open up, such

<p align="left"><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>E-Mail from Elly
Hill (see earlier items dated 14th April and 24th May).</p>

<p align="left">Some exciting news was today received Elly Hill
via e-mail, let me share this e-mail:</p>

<p align="left"><em>I have some exciting news for you!! I've
managed to locate a descendant of Edward &amp; Irene Snook and
recently spoke with him too.&nbsp; I had thought success in this<br>
research would take much longer and was prepared to 'go the extra
mile' if necessary, but sometimes in this job one gets really
lucky and everything just<br>
falls into place...lucky you! </em></p>

<p align="left"><em>To give you an outline of the research so
far:</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>A search was made of the New South Wales
Probate Index (1800-1985) by year from 1925 for details of any
Wills for Snook and the following information was found:
&quot;Ernest Edward Snook - DOD 2/2/1978 - Acta - Yagoona&quot;
Following on from that information, a search was made of the
Sydney Morning Herald newspaper&nbsp; February 1978 for the
obituary notice of Ernest Edward Snook. </em></p>

<p align="left"><em>The following entries were found:</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>&quot;SNOOK - Ernest Edward, February 2,
1978, of Yagoona dearly beloved husband of Irene, loved father of
Stanley, Norma and Narelle.&nbsp; Fond father-in-law and
grandfather of their families. At rest.&quot;..Labor Funerals,
Bankstown. </em></p>

<p align="left"><em>'SNOOK - The relatives and friends of the
late Ernest Edward Snook of Yagoona, are invited to attend his
funeral service to take place within the chapel of the
Crematorium Rookwood today (Friday) at 11am...Labor Funerals,
Bankstown.' </em></p>

<p align="left"><em>A telephone call to Labor Funerals for any
details of a post 1978 death of Irene Snook was not successful,
however a call to Rookwood Crematorium found Irene Snook in their
index with her date of death as 3 March 1994.</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>On the premise that perhaps Stanley (son of
Edward and Irene as per obituary notice) may still be alive I
extracted 24 Snook telephone numbers from the Sydney white
pages.&nbsp; There were two entries for &quot;S. Snook&quot; and
telephone calls were made to both numbers.&nbsp; The second call
was in fact Stanley Snook who was very interested in my enquiry
regarding the family research and very happy for you to contact
him, Graham, at the following address:</em></p>

<p align="left">Address Withheld</p>

<p align="left"><em>He also told me that he is aged 72 or 73 (he
said he wasn't sure which, I'd have to ask his wife, she'd
know!!) and that his two sisters have children as does
he....&nbsp; he didn't know quite a lot about the family but did
know that his grandmother's name was Howard.</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>So that's excellent news isn't it. I
personally feel very satisfied if I can connect people with
living relatives or descendants...makes my job really worthwhile.
I hope you're pleased with the results so far Graham and I'll
look forward to your comments at your convenience. Best regards,
Elly</em></p>

</ul>

<p>Searched Birth registers for<em><strong> John Smith </strong></em>birth
1910-1912 - seven entries for a John Smith born Wandsworth - four
with maiden name of mother given. (<strong>Note: </strong>from
1911 British Birth Registers include details of mother's maiden
name making it easier to identify siblings and related families).
Decided to wait and see what the birth certificate of Arthur
Albert Smith revealed, if anything.</p>

<p>Searched Marriage registers for the marriage of <em><strong>Charles
Smith </strong></em>1905-1909. No entries for a Charles James
Smith in Wandsworth but a couple (Lambeth and Southwark) look
interesting. Will wait and see what birth certificate confirms in
terms of full name. At least four other marriage entries in
Wandsworth for a Charles Smith.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Visit to
Wandsworth Local Studies Library, Clapham Junction.</p>

<p><strong><b>Purpose: </b></strong>Searching for the Marriage of
<em><strong>George Edward Howard </strong></em>and <em><strong>Maude
Violet Howard</strong></em>. [F245]. </p>

<p>According to notes provided by Betty Taylor (nee Howard)
George and Maud Howard had 2 children. A son called Clarence and
a daughter called Eleanor May. Eleanor May married a Stanley
White (possibly Royal Navy) c. 1941 when Betty was c. 17. At that
time Eleanor's mother was living with her sister (May) at 20 (?)
Oberstein Road, St. Johns Hill, Battersea. </p>

<p>The marriage between Eleanor May and Stanley White was
subsequently found in 1944. What is clear is that George left
Maud shortly after the children were born it would appear but I
have to date not found George/Maude's wedding or birth date for
Eleanor. Without mothers maiden name it is proving illusive. </p>

<p>One search option is to look up the names of the people living
at 18/20 Oberstein Road c. 1944 in the electoral register to
determine married name of Maud's sister May. If this marriage can
be traced this will reveal the maiden name of Maud Violet and
hence the date of her marriage to George Edward. </p>

Library to pursue this marriage. The following records were
