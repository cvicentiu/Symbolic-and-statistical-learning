    Frank remembers that his grandfather read at least 2 newspapers per day, and 
    was surprisingly fluent in English, while his grandmother spoke little 
    English, but could communicate in Spanish.&nbsp; His grandfather came to the US 
    in 1911 with his brother Ben and his brother-in-law, José Mari Goitiandia, 
    and his grandmother came in 1916, with the couple’s 4-year old son, Joe.&nbsp; 
    Benita lived to be 92, and Francisco lived to be 83—Frank thinks they came 
    from Aulestia.&nbsp; Francisco had emigrated to make a better living, beginning 
    as a sheepherder in Shoshone.&nbsp; Francisco family name was originally Oneindia, 
    but was changed when his first paycheck was written Oneida.&nbsp; He later bought 
    his own sheep with his brother (the Oneida Sheep Company had 6000 sheep at 
    its peak), and constructed the Palace Pool Hall in Shoshone.&nbsp; The company 
    became Oneida incorporated after WWII.&nbsp; Frank remembers hanging out at his 
    grandfather’s sheep operation as a child; he loved fishing, swimming, and 
    helping out.&nbsp; Francisco had 2 accordions, and although he was largely 
    self-taught, he was quite good.&nbsp; He always dreamed of going to Chicago to 
    take professional lessons, but it never worked out.&nbsp; Benita had a boarding 
    house in Shoshone where music was always popular—in fact, this is where 
    Frank met accordionist Jimmy Jausoro.&nbsp; [Frank explains a panoramic photo of 
    Shoshone and the house].&nbsp; The Pagoaga, Beitia, Berriochoa and Soloaga 
    families all had boarding houses in the same area of town.&nbsp; </span></p>

    <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">13-16:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Frank’s dad is Anastacio (wed a non-Basque, Violet Howard), whose siblings 
    were Ben (married to Julia Anchustegui), José “Joe” (wed non-Basque Marion), 
    Pete (wed non-Basque Dolly), Martin (wed non-Basque Garnet), and Mary.&nbsp; Joe 
    and Pete are still living.&nbsp; Frank does not recall when his parents bought 
    their boarding house, but Benita ran it until about 1966, when Pete and 
    Dolly took over for a few more years, at which point the residents were 
    mainly retired Basques.&nbsp; Frank knows his grandparents had the house when he 
    was born in 1929, so it was possibly purchased around 1925.&nbsp; </span></p>

    Frank’s mother Violet was born in Mackey in 1909.&nbsp; Her mother was a Hearse 
    (Welsh, family came to the US in the 1890s) and her father a Howard 
    (English, came when he was 6), who was a cattleman.&nbsp; Frank was born on 
    December 4, 1929, the first grandchild to Francisco and Benita.&nbsp; His brother 
    is John Luis, who is currently a civil engineer in Fresno and who has lived 
    in Saudi Arabia for 5 years and worked in Pakistan and Indonesia for 5.&nbsp; 
    Frank’s parents were married in July of 1929 in Challis.&nbsp; This was back 
    during Prohibition, and Frank recalls that the Basques found ways to 
    circumvent the temperance laws.&nbsp; He describes what it was like growing up in 
    a mixed Basque/non-Basque family.&nbsp; He had a great time, but his parents and 
    uncles decided that since they were now Americans, they would only teach 
    their children English.&nbsp; Frank only spoke Basque with his grandmother (who 
    spoke no English), and used to help her out with errands.&nbsp; As he started 
    school, he remembered less and less of the language, but could still 
    understand quite a bit (he recalls arguing with his aunt over a name she 
    called him in Basque once).&nbsp; Frank regrets having lost this connection to 
    his past.&nbsp; He had a consciousness of this “blank spot” from an early age.&nbsp; 
    His dad graduated from Shoshone High School in 1928, and never had any 
    problem with English or with American sports.&nbsp; Frank grew up in his 
    grandparents’ boarding house, moved to the family ranch outside of town at 
    the age of 13 for 3 years, and then moved back into town.&nbsp; As a youngster, 
    Frank worked at a bowling alley, as well as around the family ranch.&nbsp; There 
    was also a lot of time for fun, including an annual Basque picnic near 
    Ketchum, frequent Basque dancing, and Mus games.</span></p>

    Frank’s grandmother used to take him around to visit all the Basque families 
    in Shoshone, and he lists a few of the area Basque children he knew.&nbsp; There 
    was always a closeness with these area Basques, and there was an annual 
    Basque dance that drew people from towns all over the area.&nbsp; People rarely 
    drove to Boise when Frank was a youngster, and so pretty much stayed in his 
    community.&nbsp; When he did come to Boise, he didn’t know very many Basques.&nbsp; 
    Basques in general are a very inclusive bunch.&nbsp; He lists some of his friends 
    as a child: Lucy Zabala, Marie Teresa Berriochoa, Johnny Beitia, and 
    others.&nbsp; Many Basque girls from Shoshone came to Boise to become nurses, 
    including Marie Garmendia and Alicia Lete.&nbsp; There were not many young Basque 
    boys in the area when Frank was growing up.&nbsp; He talks about the Anchustegui 
    family, who had a boarding house in Boise.</span></p>

    Basques and non-Basques mixed well in Shoshone, since the community had been 
    there a long time.&nbsp; Frank does remember being the victim of a racial slur 
    from a drunk woman once, but this type of discrimination was the exception.&nbsp; 
    At the time, there were also a number of well-respected Mexican immigrants 
    in Shoshone, one of whom was an excellent cook.&nbsp; The Manhattan Café and the 
    Boston Café were run by Japanese immigrants to Idaho, and Frank is friends 
    with some of these people to this day.&nbsp; Shoshone townspeople were a little 
    disturbed by a cantankerous old German man who put up the swastika during 
    WWII, and the sheriff made him take it down.&nbsp; While Basques wanted to 
    integrate, however, many other ethnic groups were content to stay within 
    their own cultural circles.</span></p>

    Frank graduated from high school in 1947 (his class had 25 students).&nbsp; There 
    were few jobs for kids in town at the time, but plenty of unpaid chores at 
    home!&nbsp; He talks about how difficult field labor was, including mucking 
    lambing sheds, corralling horses, pitching hay, and so on.&nbsp; This was mostly 
    summer work, since Shoshone winters were very harsh (which allowed, 
    nevertheless, the annual construction of an ice-skating pond).&nbsp; Once he 
    graduated, Frank worked for the State Highway Department for 1 year, then at 
    Grange Wholesale (selling combines, etc.) for a few years.</span></p>

    Frank surveyed and drafted for a conservation service for a few years, and 
    passed up the chance to work in California, Washington and Hawaii for a 
    semester at Idaho State University, at which he got his draft call.&nbsp; He 
    wanted to volunteer for the Air Force, but there were no recruiters in Twin 
    Falls where he had gone, and so Frank ended up being drafted into the Korean 
    War in 1951.&nbsp; he got out in February of 1953, and went to Idaho State 
    University on the GI Bill.&nbsp; He stayed there for a year, joining the swim 
    team, but was unhappy with engineering, so he decided to pursue geology at 
    the University of Idaho.&nbsp; He graduated in 1958, and began working for the 
    Idaho Transportation Department in Shoshone right away.&nbsp; He designed roads, 
    found resources and helped with bridge foundations before moving to 
    Pocatello, where he worked until 1983.&nbsp; He transferred to Boise, where he 
    worked until his retirement in 1991.&nbsp; His wife Mary Nadine (maiden name 
    Williams) worked at the Boise State University library until her retirement, 
    at which the couple began square dancing (Mary is a cues now!).&nbsp; Mary, 
    though 4 years younger than Frank, also grew up in Shoshone.&nbsp; The couple 
    celebrates their 49<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year; his brother and 
    cousin married the same year.&nbsp; Mary has is not of Basque descent (she’s mostly 
    Welsh, and her family has been American for a long time), but Frank never 
    felt any pressure from his family to marry a Basque (his mother was all for 
    it, and his paternal grandparents had always accepted his mother).&nbsp; Mary 
    enjoys Basque food</span></p>

    Frank’s oldest son Gary Frank was born in Moscow in 1954, the second, Arlen 
    Dean, was born in Jerome in 1958, and youngest Patrick Lynn was born in 
    Jerome in 1963.&nbsp; He discusses their careers and marriages (one spouse is 
    working on the Heritage Theater now).&nbsp; Frank has met Anthony Hopkins twice 
    through this drama connection.&nbsp; Frank even met and talked to Hemingway in 
    Sun Valley several times (“about as nice a guy as you ever wanted to see in 
    your life”), and once saw actor Gary Cooper in the Manhattan Café in 
    Shoshone.&nbsp; Frank remembers the building of Sun Valley, and had no idea what 
    it would turn into.&nbsp; Basques were important early residents of the area.</span></p>

    Frank discusses his children’s involvement with the Basque community.&nbsp; One 
    of them enjoyed Basque dancing, but quit soon after.&nbsp; The others live in 
    areas where there aren’t any real Basque organizations.&nbsp; The boys never 
    really got into the culture, mostly from lack of exposure in the communities 
    they lived in.&nbsp; Frank’s family has gone to a few Basque dances, though.&nbsp; 
    Frank has never visited the Basque country, partly because his wife gets 
    very airsick (which she discovered on a trip to New Orleans).&nbsp; [Mikel 
    announces that Mary has joined the group].&nbsp; Frank is a member of the Basque 
    Museum, though, because his children and grandchildren always want to visit 
    this institution when they visit.&nbsp; Frank identifies himself strongly as a 
    Basque, but considers it as almost a split personality.&nbsp; He talks about 
    Basque athletic prowess during high school.&nbsp; His family is the main reason 
    Frank feels so Basque.</span></p>

    Old Basque herders that Frank knew from his toddler days in the boarding 
    house always seemed like part of his extended cultural family.&nbsp; 
    Celebrating traditions, and even good-natured arguing between people is a good way to 
    get attached to an identity.&nbsp; His grandmother’s boarding house was 
    well-known for it’s Thanksgiving, Christmas, and 3 Kings festivities—one of 
    the few places in Shoshone where dancing and fun was very common.&nbsp; Frank 
    says that when it comes right down to it, it’s a waste to throw away one’s 
    heritage.</span></p>
