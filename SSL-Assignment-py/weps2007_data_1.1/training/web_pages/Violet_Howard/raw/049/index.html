<b>What is all of this?</b><br>

This is retardedjimmy.com.  We write reviews about pretty much anything and everything we can get our hands on.  Some of them are straightforward movie or videogame reviews, but others can get a little wackier.<br><br>

<b>Who's in charge here?</b><br>

Mike "<a href="mailto:rjimmy@retardedjimmy.com">retardedjimmy</a>" Schramm runs the site and writes quite a few of the reviews. He is from St. Louis, graduated a few years ago with a degree in Broadcasting (and an English minor), and currently works at a Chicago bookstore while he tries to find a job in media, or at least as a freelance writer.  He thinks Batman is the greatest and could beat the crap out of Superman any day of the week.  He splits his free time between watching things, reviewing things he's watched, and writing his second novel, which may or may not be someday published.  He does stuff on his website, conviently located at <a href="http://www.mikeschramm.com">mikeschramm.com</a><br><br>

<a href="mailto:lobsterharmonica@retardedjimmy.com">LobsterHarmonica</a> does not run the site but thinks he is a critic of some sort.  He watches too many cartoons and hopes the bastards that cancelled his favorites (Family Guy, Invader Zim) are choking on day old donuts.   As soon as he finishes grad school, he plans to "take it to the streets" and tell the "homeboys" to "be cool, stay in school."  Now that's no jive.<br><br>

<a href="mailto:violethoward@retardedjimmy.com">Violet Howard</a> is a freelance writer who has contributed to the Boston Globe, The Somerville News, and online journal Salon. She lives in Austin, TX.<br><Br>

<a href="mailto:rjimmy@retardedjimmy.com">mookie02</a> was a founding member.  He's written a few reviews, and though he still checks in from time to time, he doesn't get a chance to write much anymore<br><Br>

<b>There are spelling and punctuation errors everywhere!  Don't you all know how to spell?</b><br>

Yes of course we do-- we just don't know how to type.  Seriously, we try to be as correct as possible, but nobody's perfekt.  If we went back and fixed all the errors on the site, we'd never have time to write any new reviews.  I apologize for spelling errors-- feel free to donate below so we can buy a dictionary.<br><br>

<b>How did [review] get such a [low/high] score?  It was [awesome/stupid]!!  You all are crazy!</b><br>

Let me take a second to explain our rating scale.  We rate everything from 0-10, with 0 being so bad it's possibly life endangering to experience, and 10 being created by God herself, and therefore flawless and pure as the driven snow.  5 is right in the middle, dead center average.  A lot of other sites rate stuff from 0 to 10, but consider anything under 6 or 7 not worth taking a look at-- to them we say, "Why not use the whole scale?"  Thus, something that is just barely below average, but is still worth it for fans might get a 4.5, while something that isn't great, but has good qualities might get a 6.  Got it?  Good.<br><Br>

<b>This site is totally "retarded"! You all suck!</b><br>

That's not a question, but yes very funny.  Thanks for coming.<br><Br>

<a name="donate"></a><b>You're welcome.  Actually I was just kidding, I like the site.  What can I do to help?</b><br>

I'm glad you asked.  Believe me, plenty of time and creativity has been devoted to this site.  If you enjoy the content, and want to let us know it, there are a couple of ways to do so.<br><br>
First and foremost, donate back a bit of your own time and insight, and leave a few comments.  Disagree or agree, stay on topic, or don't.  Whatever.  We appreciate it.<br><br>
Also, there are fairly limitless amounts of things to review, and we're open to any and all of them.  If you have an idea of something to be reviewed, or, even better, can supply us with something you'd like reviewed, heck, we're up for it.  Send an email to <A HREF="http://www.retardedjimmy.com//contact.html">retardedjimmy</a> and he'll help you out.<br><br>
Finally, unfortunate as it may be, the Internet isn't free.  Despite our best efforts to the contrary, our web hosts have refused to be paid in "time" and "creativity", so they require cold hard cash.  If you'd like to help us out, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=fmfunhouse%40hotmail.com&item_name=Retarded+Jimmy%27s&no_shipping=1&cn=Optional+Remarks&tax=0&currency_code=USD">Paypal donations</a> are all set up and running.  Every penny will go into making the site better, and we'll definitely appreciate it.<br><Br>

<b>Wanna exchange links?</b><br>
YES!  Go <a href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com//friends.php">here</a>.<br><br>

<b>That all sounds good, but I was thinking of bigger things... I want to write reviews!  Can I write for the site?</b><br>

Yeah! We are always looking to add writers to the site.  Write a few reviews (no more than two or three paragraphs), email them over to retardedjimmy, and he'll check them and maybe even post them up.  But of course the easiest way to get your writing on the site is post it in the comments!<br><br>

<b>I like your opinions.  What did you think of...?</b><br>

Thank you.  The cool thing about writing up your opinions and posting them on the internet is that you find out that a lot of people actually agree with you.  A lot don't, of course, but it's America-- whaddaya gonna do?<br><br>

We like to review anything and everything, and if you have something that you'd like us to review or know our opinions on, feel free to <a0- href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com//contact.php">contact us</a> and let us know.  Generally, we try to review mostly new stuff (because that seems to be what the most people want to know about), but every once in a while we'll go back and review something a little older or more classic.  And sometimes we'll do features where we'll review <a href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com/archives/000149.html">almost anything</a>, so keep an eye out for those.  Finally, we also now have a regular feature called <a href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com/archives/000225.html">Ask RJ</a> in which rj will answer your questions about anything and everything, so you can <a href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com//contact.html">contact us</a> for that too.  We probably can't answer every question everybody has, but we'll certainly try.<br><br>

<b>How'd you manage to set all this up?  And by that I mean, would you like to give credit to people/sites who helped you?</b><br>

Why yes.  Yes I would.  We're hosted very cheaply but well by <a href="http://www.h2hosting.com/">H2hosting</a>.  The site has gone through about 3 iterations, first as a template blog on blogger, and then much more customized on Moveable Type.  In its current incarnation, we run Retarded Jimmy's on the amazing open source content management system, <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.  We use their basic engine, and RJ has customized almost all of the code with plugins and his own monkeying to fit our needs.<br><br>

<b>On the top of the front page, the name of your site is Retarded Jimmy's something or other.  Last time I checked, wasn't it Retarded Jimmy's something else?</b><br>

Yeah, retardedjimmy thought it'd be funny to set up a script that randomized the title of the site every time.  One time it's "Retarded Jimmy's Floors and Carpeting," the next time you refresh it's "Retarded Jimmy's Secret Service."  In fact, if you think of some good titles, you can send them to <a href="http://www.retardedjimmy.com//contact.php">rj</a>, and he'll put them in the script, so next time you might see them up there.<br><br>

<b>Hey, that's actually pretty neat.</b><br>

That's not really a question either, but yeah, we thought so too.<br><br>
