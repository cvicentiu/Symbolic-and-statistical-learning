                    <p align="left"><br>
                      Joe Lynnderman Alford, son of Charles Ray and Bonnie Kathlyn 
                      King Alford, was born August 8, 1956, in Galveston, Texas. 
                      He departed this life on Thursday, October 5, 2006 in Barnes 
                      Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of fifty 
                      years, one month, and twenty-seven days.<br>
                      He was united in marriage to Allison Beth Neal, on March 
                      20, 1981, and to this union three children were born.<br>
                      His mother preceded him in death on September 27, 2003.<br>
                      Joe is survived by his wife, Allison, of the home; three 
                      children, Dawn Barnett, Jonathan Alford, and his wife, Katrina, 
                      and James Alford, and his wife, Marlie, all of Lebanon, 
                      Missouri; seven grandchildren, Tiffani Barnett, Korisha 
                      Barnett, Kourtney Barnett, Haylie Alford, Brianne Day, Ciara 
                      Alford, and Hayden Alford; his father and step-mother, Charles 
                      and Margot Alford, of Purdon, Texas; four sisters, Della 
                      Kimmel, Theresa King, and her husband, Don, all of Lebanon, 
                      Missouri, Linda McGowan, of St. Louis, Missouri, and Amanda 
                      Alford, of Purdon, Texas; five brothers, Charles, Jr., Robert, 
                      and his wife, Susie, Jerry, and his wife, Mary, all of Lebanon, 
                      Missouri, Kendall, of Purdon, Texas, and Patrick, and his 
                      wife, Sarah, of Orange, Texas; a number of nieces, nephews, 
                      and cousins; and a host of other relatives and friends.<br>
                      He was born in Galveston, Texas and spent his childhood 
                      there. The family moved to the Lebanon area during his teens 
                      and he was a 1974 graduate of the Lebanon High School. He 
                      served his country faithfully in the United States Marines. 
                      In addition to being an over-the-road truck driver, he had 
                      owned an auto parts business for several years until his 
                      health failed.<br>
                      Joe had professed his faith in Christ and was an active 
                      member of the Emmanuel Chapel Church.<br>
                      He was part of the Alpha One support group in St. Louis, 
                      Missouri, and a member of the Better Breathers Club in Lebanon.<br>
                      In his spare time he enjoyed fishing on open waters, and 
                      loved family gatherings, especially barbeques.<br>
                      Joe was a loving husband, father, grandfather, son, brother, 
                      and uncle, and was a caring neighbor and friend. We celebrate 
                      his life and his accomplishments and will treasure the memories 
                      he made for his family and friends. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">Services will be held at 10:30 a.m. Monday, 
                      October 9, 2006, at Emmanuel Chapel, Lebanon. Burial will

                      years, five months, and one day.<br>
                      He was preceded in death by his parents.<br>
                      Charles is survived by a daughter, Sharon May Hudspeth, 
                      and her husband, Jim, of Richardson, Texas, and a son, Alden 
                      Ray Burch, and his wife, Rita, of Lebanon, Missouri; three 
                      grandchildren, Julie Sicard, Josh Burch, and Christopher,

                      He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but was raised in 
                      the Macks Creek, Missouri community. In the late 1950s he 
                      moved to Dallas, Texas and worked in the sheet-metal business 
                      until his retirement. After he retired he moved to Lebanon 
                      to make his home.<br>
                      Charles served his country faithfully in the U.S. Army.<br>
                      He especially enjoyed country western music and bluegrass<br>
                      music was very important to him. Charles took great pride 
                      in his knowledge of music and could never be stopped on 
                      trivia questions. He also enjoyed watching western movies 
                      in his spare time.<br>
                      Although Charles was a private person, he dearly loved his 
                      children and grandchildren.<br>

                      enjoyed traveling, hunting, and fishing.<br>
                      Jim always said, &#8220;I hope that people are better off 
                      for having known me, and that they know how much their friendship 
                      has meant to me.&#8221;<br>

                      family gatherings and especially holidays were very special 
                      to her. She had a fondness for dogs and usually had one

                      had attended Sleeper Pentecostal Church with his family. 
                      He later attended the Cedar Ridge Freewill Baptist Church

                    <p align="left">Florence Rebecca Weeks, daughter of Abraham 
                      Stoner and Etta Magdalene Moye Miller, was born August 7, 
                      1920, in St. Clair County, Missouri. She departed this life 
                      on Monday, October 23, 2006 in Maranatha Village, Springfield, 
                      Missouri, at the age of eighty-six years, two months, and 
                      sixteen days. <br>
                      In March, 1950, she was united to Stanley E. Weeks, and 
                      to this union five children were born.<br>
                      She was preceded in death by her parents; her husband, Stanley, 
                      on September 14, 1963; one grandchild, Cheryl, one great-grandchild, 
                      Jordan; one sister, Bertha, and a brother, Joseph.<br>
                      Florence is survived by three sons and daughters-in-law, 
                      Stan Weeks, and his wife, Cindy, of Sparta, Missouri, Paul 
                      Weeks, and his wife, Becky, and Jackie Weeks, and his wife, 
                      Grace, all of Highlandville, Missouri; two daughters, Judy 
                      Carpone, and her husband, Marcus, of Tucson, Arizona, and 
                      Rebecca Howard, of Kempner, Texas; eight grandchildren; 
                      five great-grandchildren; two brothers, David and Abraham 
                      Miller, both of the State of Kansas, and one sister, Etta 
                      Betts, of the State of Kansas; two nephews, Bob Bailey, 
                      and his wife, Elsie, and L.L. Bailey and his wife, Mary, 
                      all of Lebanon, Missouri; and other nieces and nephews; 
                      as well as a host of other relatives and friends.<br>
                      She was born and raised in St. Clair County and spent her 
                      early years in Southwest Missouri. After she met and married 
                      Stanley, they made their home in Springfield and lovingly 
                      raised their family. After her husband&#8217;s death, she 
                      worked for several years in hotel management. Florence then 
                      moved to Lebanon in 1976 and began employment with the H.D. 
                      Lee plant until her retirement.<br>
                      Florence had made her profession of faith and was a member 
                      of First Baptist Church of Lebanon. She also was a lifetime 
                      member of the V.F.W. lady&#8217;s auxiliary.<br>
                      In her spare time, she enjoyed reading murder mysteries, 
                      quilting, and crocheting. She was an avid follower of the 
                      &#8220;Jesse James&#8221; era and always ready to watch 
                      the movie &#8220;Gone With the Wind&#8221; and sharing Scarlett&#8217;s 
                      dilemma. She had a warm, outgoing personality and was always 
                      ready to share her sense of humor.<br>
                      Florence was a loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, 
                      sister, aunt, and was a caring neighbor and friend. We celebrate 
                      her life and her accomplishments and will cherish the wonderful 
                      memories she created for her family and friends.<br>
