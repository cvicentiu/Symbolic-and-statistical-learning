<p align="left"><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Telephone call to
Martin Howard.</p>

<p><strong><b>Discovery: </b></strong>Spoke with Martin Howard
who confimred that he was the son of Dorreen and Kenneth Howard
and also advised that there had been a third son, Robin, born
1961. Arrangements made to visit with Martin Howard on 23rd
August 1999.</p>

<p><font color="#800000"><strong><b>12th August 1999</b></strong><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Telephone call to
Whitby's, Chichester.</p>

<p><strong><b>Results: </b></strong>Spoke with Whitby's who
remembered Martin Howard and were able to provide an address and
telephone number in Normandy, Surrey, not 10 miles from my own
address where Martin had been living as late as September 1998. I
called the number and an answer machine confirmed that a Martin
did still live at that address. Message left to call me. <em><strong>It
seems I have found Martin Howard</strong></em>!</p>

</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Visit to Local Studies Library
at Chichester to inspect Electoral Rolls for occupants of &quot;Cherrytrees&quot;,
Main Road, Chidham, Chichester, West Sussex.</p>

<p><strong><b>Results: </b></strong>Inspected Electoral Rolls
from 1985 to present day and the occupants of the address given
by Martin Howard were a Mr. and Mrs. Heath. As they appeared to
be still living at that address I visited the address later that
day and met with Mr. Heath. He had no recollection of a Martin
Howard but suggested that they had in the past let out a self
contained flat and that his wife might remember if a Martin
Howard had been a tennant. Later that day Mrs Heath telephoned to
confirm, that a Martin Howard had indeed stayed with them at that
time and recalled that he had worked for a well known
photographers in Chichester called Whitby's. </p>

    <li><b>Death - Sarah Howard</b> died 6th October 1856, aged
        26 at West Molsey. Death reported by James Howard,
        husband. Seems likely that this was the James and Sarah
        married at Walton on Thames in 1854. </li>
    <li><b>Birth - Doreen May Cage</b> 2nd February 1921 at 57
        Lincoln Road, East Finchly, London. daughter of Harry

        Main Road, Chidham, Chichester, West Sussex. A lead with
        which to find Martin Howard and from there the remaining
        people in that branch of the Howard family. </li>
    <li><b>Death - Maud Violet Howard</b> on 11 June 1975 living
        at Hoybourne, Holybourne Avenue, Putney. Death reported
        by Betty Ann Nicholls (Cousin) No address given for

        Maud Violet Howard (nee??) [P696].</li>
    <li><b>Death - Kenneth Alfred Howard</b> 25th March 1982
        husband of Doreen May Cage who reported death. Living at

        1854. </li>
    <li><b>Birth - Doreen May Cage</b> 1Q 1921, To confirm birth

<p><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Letter from County Archivist,
Surrey County Council</p>

<p><strong><b>Content: </b></strong>The long awaited letter
arrived with details of the Latin translation of the discovery
made earlier in the month (see entry dated 8th February 1999) The
letter was accompanied by a four-page translation of the relevant
section of document G165/59/6 - Manorial Roll for Long Ditton ,
1722 (Lovelace Papers). The four-page translation revealed that
James Howard's wife was indeed a Barbara and in addition provided
her maiden name - Loach. They were seeking legal tenancy to a
piece of land in Long Ditton previously granted to one William
Ginger. A great find which confirmed a link to a couple I had
discovered some 3 years earlier. To review the text of this
translation please read <a href="http://www.howard-kin.com/roll.htm" target="main">Long
Ditton Manorial Roll Extract</a>.</p>

<p><strong><b>Event: </b></strong>Visit to Surrey History Centre,
Woking, with Rose Bateman</p>

<p><strong><b>Discovery: </b></strong>I invited my distant cousin
who shares my interest in our family history, Rose Bateman, to
the Surrey History Centre at Woking, Surrey. She has never been
and was interested in looking at some of the older source
material I had found from the Manors of Long Ditton and Thames
Ditton. In reading through this material Rose came across the
names <em><strong>James Howard</strong></em> and <em><strong>Barbara</strong></em>
embedded in a piece of Latin text dating from 1722. The document
was the Manorial Roll for Long Ditton 1722 (Lovelace Estate
papers). I requested the County Archivist to translate the
relevant section and paid the fee - now we must wait to discover
what the document reveals, if anything! </p>
