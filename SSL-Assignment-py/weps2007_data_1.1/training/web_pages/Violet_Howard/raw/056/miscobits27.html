Ventura County Star Paper, Ventura, California
   <a name="03"><b>Juanita “Nita” Milam</b></a> died peacefully on March 10, 2006, after a lengthy
illness.
   Nita Milam was born Nita Kendrick to parents Bennie Kendrick and
Florence May Moulder in Linn Creek, Mo. (Camden County) on July 13,
1927.  She had three sisters, Violet Bradley and Betty Kendrick (both
deceased) and Beulah Shewmaker, as well as two brothers, Robert and
Raymond Kendrick (both deceased).  Violet was the only sibling to have
a child, Jim Bradley (deceased).
   Nita graduated from Buffalo High School in 1946, and soon after
followed her sister, Beulah, and Beulah’s husband, Gene Shewmaker, to
Ventura to work in their restaurant, the Seaview Café.  After the
Shewmakers returned to Missouri, Nita remained to manage various
restaurants in Ventura.
   In 1961, she married Cleck Milam, and together they opened their first
restaurant, The White Bib, which along with future restaurants became
favorites with the local community and tourists equally.  Part of their
success came from the friendly welcome of this great team, where Nita
and Cleck cultivated loyalty among employees and customers.  Even after
Cleck died in 1977, Nita continued to successfully run their last
restaurant, Cleck’s Beef & Bourbon, for several years.  Nita will be
missed by her many close friends, employees and patrons alike.
   Nita is survived and missed by her stepdaughter and son-in-law, Toby
and Richard McGee of Ventura, as well as their daughter, Shauna McGee
of San Francisco; her sister, Beulah Shewmaker, great-niece Rene
Bradford and her husband, Olin, and great-niece Elaine Anderson and her
husband, Bobby, and their daughter, Megan, all from Buffalo, Mo.  In
her later life, Nita married Dr. Robert Siefert, and will also be
missed by her stepson, Richard, his wife, Julie, and their son,
Jeffrey.

and RayNell Markham, who were so loving and helpful during Nita’s last
year, as well as Nita’s longtime housekeeper and friend, Maria
Mendevil.

<a name="11"><b>A. J. Bowline</b></a>
                Born August 12 1841, Died February 13 1916.

                The subject of this sketch was born in Platt County Missouri 
in 84 and at the age of short five years came with his father, Benjamin 
Franklin Bowlin to Miller County where he resided until he was about 8 years 
old, when he moved to Laclede County, but in 1880 he returned to Miller 
County where he has since lived.  Uncle Jack grew up on the Glace where his 
father ran a grist mill, a still house and a farm.  He learned to be 
industrious and early in life affiliated with the Baptist Church of which he 
has been a member throughout his life time.  At the age of 18 years he was 
married to Elizabeth Bird who was a daughter of George Bird of Cooper 
County, Missouri.  In 1885 she was called to that unknown country from whose 
bourne no traveler returns.

                To this union were born thirteen children, eight boys, all 
living, and five girls, three of whom have passed on to their rest.

                In 1888, Mr. Bowlin was married to Sarah Johnson who 
survives him.  To this union one child was born, P. B. Bowlin who has lived 
with his father and mother on the farm and will continue to live there and 
care for his mother.

                In 1908 on his 66th anniversary and exactly 100 years from 
the birth of his father, Uncle Jack was made glad by a family reunion at 
which time all of his children were present as well as his good friends and 
neighbors.  This was the first and only time that he ever saw all of his 
children together, however they have all been at his bedside during his 
sickness and death except his son Everett.

                The only living brother, Delaney Bowlin came from Tulsa, 
Oklahoma to see Uncle Jack but arrived too late to be recognized.

                He is now at Eldon in a serious condition.  His other 
brothers Newton and John and Frank as well as Martha, Elizabeth and 
Harriett, his three sisters have preceded him to the life beyond the grave.

                Andrew Jackson Bowlin was an old soldier being a corporal in 
Company "B" 46th Regiment, Missouri Infantry.  He was honorably discharged 
and drew a pension during the latter years of his life.

                Beside his widow and children he leaves 32 grandchildren and 
6 great grand children to mourn their loss as well as his church and many 
friends.

                Uncle Jack Bowline was a noble man, a kindly neighbor, a 
loving husband, a dutiful father and a good and honorable citizen.  He lived 
an active life, was very supple for a man of his years.  May his children as 
well as all of us emulate his exemplary life.

                The funeral was at Riverview Church of which Mr. Bowline was 
a member the services were conducted by Elder J. S. Mahan, in the presence 
of a large number of friends and relatives.  Though we will not again see 
Uncle Jack's face, we know that his influence was for good and he will live 
always in our hearts and minds, made better by his having passed this way. 
It is our desire to express our sympathy to the bereaved family who are in 
great sorrow and to give to them the comfort in the God of the Universe who 
cares for them as well.  --Miller  County newspaper

REMEMBERING CIRRELDA
                by Cirrelda Snider-Bryan and Liz Snider Anderson

We, the daughters of Cirrelda and Jim Snider were given an invitation to 
write about our mother for the Ghost Ranch Journal.  For that we are very 
grateful because her obituary in the Denver Post didn't touch many important 
parts of her life.  Cirrelda was an active member of the Ghost Ranch 
community for many years, the past ten as a member of the board of the 
National Ghost Ranch Foundation.  Throughout her life she was active in many 
organizations that were concerned about social and political issues.

   A week before her death, on the day of her twin grandchildren's birthday, 
mother spoke of the pain her cancer was causing her stomach. Noticing Liz's 
apprehension, she said, "Honey, I'm not dying.  I'm living."  That was her 
outlook on life.  Until the day she died she remained concerned with the 
things important to her. On the bench in her bathroom the Christian Science 
Monitor lay open to an article about a curren event that mattered to her. 
Until the end she cared about what happens to people.

   Cirrelda, who died April 28 of pancreatic cancer at her home in 
Littleton, Colorado, was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma.  She attended 
Christian College in Columbia, and graduated from the University of 
Oklahoma.  She taught elementary and secondary school in El Reno, Oklahoma 
and Hobbs, New Mexico.  It was in Hobbs that Cirrelda met James W. Snider, 
whom she married in 1949. Jim died in 1980, and in 1983, Cirrelda married 
Charles B. Black.

   As a long time member of the League of Women Voters, Cirrelda helped put 
together a major change in the Tulsa City Charter.  With the LWV in 
Evergreen, Colorado, she researched and co-published the book, Know Your 
Community. She also managed the successful campaign for a Jeffco School 
Board candidate.

   Much of Cirrelda's time, energy and ability were given to the 
Presbyterian Church. She and Jim were founding members of the Church of the 
Advent in Tulsa.  While a member of the Capital Heights Presbyterian Church 
of Denver, she served on several Denver Presbytery committees concerned with 
community issues. In 1978 she was a General Assembly Commissioner, standing 
firmly with the minority in support of gay and lesbian rights in the church. 
Her more recent membership in the Columbine United Church of Littleton was a 
constant source of stimulation and a place where she could continue being 
actively involved with issues important to her.  As social Concerns 
Committee chair she dealt with racism, death and dying, child and 
teen-rearing, as well as arranging for adult study leadership.

   Throughout the last half of her life, Ghost Ranch enriched mother's and 
our family's life immeasurably.  So many happy memories for her of 
paleontology with Dr. Colvert, archaeology with Dr. Ellis, Northern New 
Mexico with Tomas Atencio, Doug George's seminars on Artistic Traditions of 
the Southwest, and Peter Van Dresser's enthusiasm for solar energy.  And 
there were the geology seminars she shared with Dad.  The ranch was her 
place for learning, exploration and friendship.

   We had such wonderful parents.  Ghost Ranch will be one of the places 
where our memories of them will be the deepest and most inspired.  We love 
them very much.

PROMINENT PONCA CITY MEN KILLED IN CRASH ON BRIDGE
AS ICY HIGHWAYS TAKE TOLL
Deaths of Former Mayor, Dentist Boost State Total
   A former Ponca City mayor and a prominent dentist killed in car-truck 
accident seven miles south of here on S. H. 40 Tuesday afternoon with the 
deaths of four others, sent the state's traffic highway toll to an all time 
high - 713, or 55 more than for this time last year.

   Eight other persons were injured Tuesday in mishaps on area highways.

   Dr. Otis E. Burris, 71, of 307 North Fourth, a passenger in an auto 
driven by William J. Casemore, 75 year old former major and retired 
businessman, was killed in the crash on the Salt Fork River bridge seven 
miles south of here.

   Casemore died at Ponca City Hospital about an hour and a half after the 
accident.

   The two men had been on a hunting trip.

   They were traveling north on S. H. about 2 p.m. when the car went out of 
control and into a spin on the ice-coated bridge.

   The auto collided with a truck-trailer which was being driven south on 
the bridge by Jimmie Gene Boles, 41, Broken Bow.  He was not hurt.

Collides With Bridge
   Patrol Trooper Robert Justus said the Casemore car then apparently struck 
the bridge before coming to a stop some distance north of the collision with 
the truck.  He said the car apparently had collided with the bridge before 
the collision with the other vehicle.

   One of two dogs being carried in the car was killed, the other injured to 
the extent it had to be destroyed.

   The car was demolished.  Extensive damage resulted to the truck tractor.

   The fatal accident climaxed a series of mishaps on the bridge which began 
55 minutes earlier. Ruth Ellen Summers, 218 North Peachtree, Ponca City, 
suffered apparent minor injuries when the car she was driving apparently 
skidded on the bridge and collided with a banister, Justus said.  She was 
taken to a Ponca City clinic.

In Loving Memory of  <a name="28"><b>OMA BURRIS WEATHERHOLT</b></a>

February 3, 1894 - April 18, 1978

by Catherine Wolff

                There was a big, old walnut table in my grandparents' dining 
room.  Around it the family would gather - the aunts and uncles, the 
grandchildren and cousins.  We would feast on the best potato salad I've 
ever tasted, my grandfather's special biscuits and apple butter, lots of ham 
and chicken and Martha's German Chocolate Cake.  After meals - and in 
between them - leaning over cups of inexhaustable coffee, the family would 
visit and catch up on each other's feelings and lives.  Politics and movie 
stars, business and food, clothes and hairstyles would all be discussed 
passionately.  But those topics would soon give way to family talk and 
memories.

                Around this table, as a child and an adult, I learned a lot 
about my grandmother - Oma Burris Weatherholt.  I learned how she grew up in 
Olean with nine sisters and brothers; I heard about the hard times, but 
never described, especially by my grandmother, with any bitterness.  I 
learned how her father had a livery business that died with the horseless 
carriage and how later he and his wife ran a boarding house in Eldon.

                At that hotel one summer, my grandmother met and fell in 
love with Harry Weatherholt.  Sixty years later she remembered and told me 
clearly of the beauty of the sweet pea flowers that climbed up a fence that 
summer out back of the hotel.

                Harry Weatherholt worked for the Rock Island Railroad and 
over the years that job and others took them to many different towns.  My 
mother has told me how her mother would no sooner have gotten the curtains 
at the windows of their new home when it was time to move on again.  My 
grandmother loved having a home, fixing it up, keeping it clean and full of 
love.  But with all the moving, she never complained.  It wasn't her nature. 
Eventually, they always would return to Eldon and no matter how far they 
went, the Burris family kept closely in touch.  They were, and are, beyond 
blood, friends.  They support each other - however they can - in times of 
crisis, births, joys, and deaths.

                Hard times had cut short my grandmother's formal schooling, 
but when her daughters and niece brought home their studies, she would sit 
with them at the dining room table and learn their lessons as well as they 
did.  Their friends quickly became her friends too, but she rarely tried to 
live her daughters' lives - only share them.  That sharing continued with 
her grandchildren.

                We lived in New York when I was a child, thousands of miles 
from Missouri.  But whenever we could - at Christmas, Easter or in the 
summer - we would pile into a car or get on a plane and travel to gather 
around that dining room table.

                Nine years ago, when I turned 21, I was a student at the 
University of Missouri in Columbia.  Turning 21 usually meant a time to 
party.  But, instead, I got on a bus that day and came to Eldon to sit 
around the table again with my grandparents.  It wasn't out of a sense of 
duty.  It was because I couldn't think of any two people I'd rather spend 
that day with and being with them always gave me a feeling of continuity - 
of a rich and full past that went far beyond my own life.  And my 
grandmother gave me something else too - an outlook on life, a strength and 
a goodness that I hoped I also could achieve.

                She loved life deeply and quietly.   She wasn't the 
flamboyant type.  She loved to visit new places, go to plays and movies, 
hear about books and ideas.  And she loved people.  She was a judging 
woman - she knew what was right and disliked what was wrong.  But she never 
passed judgment. And she gave love unconditionally.

                Around that dining room table, when talk turned to 
individuals, as it almost always did and somebody not present was getting a 
lot of criticism, my grandmother would sit quietly listening and then softly 
say something good about that person.

                Almost everyone who met her loved her.  She was a good 
listener and her spunk and sense of humor - which she learned eventually to 
direct even at herself - warmed all those who knew her.  Her faith in 
Christianity also strengthened her.  She never saved it only for Sundays, 
but tried daily to live a Christian life of giving, forgiving, and accepting 
whatever happened.

                Her father used to tell her: "Keep your back straight and 
walk with pride."  My grandmother lived that way.  When her arthritis bent 
her back and later paralysis deprived her of walking, she still lived with 
that lesson in mind.

                Oma Burris Weatherholt is not dead. She will continue to 
live eternally, but also through the people who knew her and through the 
family and friends who gathered around that dining room table over the years 
to share a cup of coffee.

Obituary for <a name="29"><b>Martha Bowlin Burris</b></a>

   Relatives and friends of the Willis M. Burris family are deeply grieved 
to hear of the death of Mrs. Burris which occurred at Eldon Saturday 
following a prolonged illness.

   Mrs. Burris was born near Bagnell January 10, 1862, a daughter of Delaney 
and Eliza Bowlin, and was therefore 70 years old at the time of her death.

   She was united in marriage 55 years ago last September to Willis M. 
Burris and the couple were honored five years ago on the occasion of their 
golden wedding anniversary, which was held just a short while before Mr. 
Burris passed away.  The Burris family resided on  a farm on the Osage river 
near Tuscumbia many years ago.  Later, Mr. Burris and his brother, Wm. J., 
engaged in the livery stable business at Tuscumbia, then the family moved to 
Olean where Mr. Burris engaged in a similar business.  The family moved to 
Eldon some twenty years ago and Mrs. Burris conducted a hotel for years at 
the Godfrey stand near the Missouri Pacific station.  In recent years they 
conducted the Burris hotel near the Rock Island station.  After his death 
five years ago, Mrs. Burris' daughter, Mrs. H. E. Weatherholt and husband 
have been with Mrs. Burris in conducting the hotel.

   Mrs. Burris is survived by five daughters and three sons, namely: Mrs. A. 
B. (Alice) Barth, of Kansas City, Mrs. L. M. (Mattie) Jones of Kansas City; 
Mrs. B. C. (Opal) Graham, of St. Louis; Mrs. F. S. (Tamar) Hunter of Eldon; 
Mrs. H. E. (Oma) Weatherholt, of Eldon, L. R. Burris of Eldon; Dr. Otis E. 
Burris, of Ponca City, Oklahoma, and Dr. Wallace M. Burris of Bixby, 
Oklahoma.  She also leaves to mourn her death two brothers and two sisters - 
J. M. Bowlin, of Mounds, Oklahoma, Dr. W. H. Bowlin of Mountain Grove. Mo.; 
Mrs. P. B. Bliss, of Tulsa Okla., and Mrs. Harriet Sandfort of Tulsa, 
Oklahoma.

   Funeral services were conducted at the Eldon Baptist church Monday 
afternoon by

Rev. J. A. Roper, the pastor, and burial was at the Tuscumbia Cemetery. 
Mrs. Burris was a lifelong member of the Baptist church, a devout Christian 
and a kind and loving mother and neighbor.  A large crowd attended her 
funeral services and many also accompanied the body to its last resting 
place at Tuscumbia.




Obituary for <a name="30"><b>Willis Mastin Burris</b></a>

   Willis M. Burris was born near Tuscumbia, Mo., March 10h 1855, and passed 
away at his home in Eldon, Mo., Dec. 11th 1926.

   Very early in life Mr. Burris united with the Harmony Baptist church and 
his good life as a father and officer in the church is well known to all 
citizens of this section of the State.

   Mr. Burris was married to Martha Bowlin, September 12, 1876.  He leaves 
his widow, three sons, L. R. Burris, of Eldon; Dr. Otis Burris, of Ponca 
City, Oklahoma; Dr. Wallace Burris of Bixby, Oklahoma; five daughters, Mrs. 
Barth, of Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Graham, of St. Louis, Mo.; Mrs. 
Weatherholt, of Eldon; Mrs. Jones, of Eldon, and Tamar; two sisters, Mrs. W. 
P. Berry, of Eldon, and Mrs. Sam Lawson, of Tuscumbia, and Mr. William 
Burris with a host of near relatives, survive him.

   The funeral of Mr. Burris was from the First Baptist Church, of Eldon, 
Monday afternoon and the interment was at the Tuscumia cemetery.  All of his 
children and near relatives were here at the funeral.

   The Rev. Magruder, former pastor of the Eldon church very fittingly spoke 
of the life of this good man.  The Rev. Magruder told it was not his custom 
to speak of the personal life of a departed friend, but Mr. Burris' life was 
so linked with his as former pastor of the church, that he wished to mention 
two outstanding qualities - "His power of Prayer" and "His ability to see 
the two sides of every question."  These qualities, with many others, made 
Mr. Burris a splendid councilor and friend to all those who knew the good 
life.  His liberal judgment made him first of all a friend of the young 
people as well as the older generation who knew him.

   Mr. Burris has long been one of the most highly respected citizens of the 
county.  He served the Baptist churches as an officer at the Harmony church 
in Tuscumbia, Olean, and Eldon.
