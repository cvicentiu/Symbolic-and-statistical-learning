Scope and Content Note

The Blair Family Papers span the years 1755-1968, with the bulk of material
dating from 1829 to 1892. The collection chronicles the activities of a
politically prominent family that included Francis Preston Blair
(1791-1876), journalist and advisor to presidents Andrew Jackson, Martin
Van Buren, and Abraham Lincoln; Francis Preston Blair (1821-1875), soldier,
United States senator, and lawyer; and Montgomery Blair (1813-1883),
lawyer, politician, and postmaster general under Abraham Lincoln. The
collection is organized in nine series: Family Correspondence, Francis
Preston Blair (1791-1876) Papers, Francis Preston Blair (1821-1875) Papers,
Gist Blair Papers, Montgomery Blair Papers, Woodbury Blair Papers, Other
Family Papers, Miscellany, and Oversize. An addition, appended to the
papers in 1997, is organized as a separate series.

The Family Correspondence series comprises letters written by family
members to one another. The most prolific correspondent represented is
Francis Preston Blair (1821-1875). His many letters to his wife, father,
and brother while serving as a Union Army officer during the Civil War
provide vivid descriptions of the military campaigns in which he was
involved. Montgomery Blair's letters to his wife and various family members
depict the political and social scene from the 1850s to the early 1870s in
St. Louis, Missouri, and later in Washington, D.C.

The series also contains numerous letters to Gist Blair from his mother,
Mary Elizabeth Woodbury Blair, from about 1875 until her death. Those from
his sister, Minna Blair Richey, provide a comprehensive source of
information about private family matters and activities during the last
decades of the nineteenth century. Letters written by Virginia Woodbury Fox
and her husband, Gustavus Vasa Fox, in the late 1860s and early 1870s
during their extensive travels in the southern states provide poignant
accounts of the social and economic conditions in the postwar South. There
are at least a few representative letters written by all major Blair family
members, including several sisters and aunts of Francis Preston Blair
(1791-1876). Also included in this series is correspondence of the extended
Blair relations, most notably the Gratz family of Philadelphia.

The papers of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876) span the period from 1829
to 1876. His general correspondence begins about the time he moved from
Kentucky to Washington, D.C., at the request of Andrew Jackson's
supporters, to establish and edit the Washington Globe newspaper. Prominent
correspondents include James Buchanan, William O. Butler, John J.
Crittenden, Andrew Jackson Donelson, John Charles and Jesse B. Frémont,
Charles Jared Ingersoll, Amos Kendall, William B. Lewis, James Parton,
Thomas Ritchie, Andrew Stevenson, and Gideon Welles. A special
correspondence subseries contains most of the letters written to Blair by
his longtime friend, Martin Van Buren, covering the period 1836 to 1861. A
few letters from Van Buren to Blair are filed with the general
correspondence subseries. Other letters sent and received by Blair and
forwarded by him to his son, Montgomery Blair, are interfiled with the
latter's general correspondence.

Blair's speeches and writings file contains rough drafts of exhortations to
presidents, letters to newspaper editors, and political campaign speeches.
A small group of miscellany contains manuscripts documenting secret
meetings between Blair and Jefferson Davis in January 1865 in Richmond,
Virginia. Included in this file are lists of points of negotiation and a
memorandum of conversations which occurred during Blair's attempts to
negotiate an end to the Civil War. Another file contains working notes and
drafts emanating from the meeting of the Republican Party National
Executive Committee in Pittsburgh in 1856.

The papers of Francis Preston Blair (1821-1875) consist of a small body of
correspondence (1853-1874) and a miscellany file. A few letters relate to
his military career during the Civil War. His political career is
documented through several speeches, fragments of political lists,
clippings, and a legal file concerning his contested congressional election
in 1862. Some of Blair's correspondence was forwarded to his brother,
Montgomery Blair, for comment or action and has been retained as a part of
Montgomery Blair's papers.

The papers of Montgomery Blair span the years from 1842 to 1887. The papers
relate chiefly to his professional career after his return from St. Louis
to Washington, D.C., in 1853. The most extensive files concern his law
practice before and after his cabinet appointment as postmaster general.
Most of his cases pertained to land patents and grants in the western
United States. Also included are three volumes containing lists of the
names of postmasters and post office revenues for the state of Maryland
from around 1861 to 1864. Financial papers record Montgomery and Mary
Elizabeth Blair's personal financial activities, especially from 1870 to
1873. Speeches and writings by Blair chiefly concern political and
religious topics, as does a substantial collection of printed matter.

Included among Montgomery Blair's correspondence are letters received and
rough drafts of letters written by Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876) and
Francis Preston Blair (1821-1875). His father and brother often sought his
advice and frequently forwarded letters received by them. Prominent
correspondents besides those already mentioned include John A. Andrew,

The papers of Gist Blair (1860-1940), lawyer and businessman, span the
period from 1830 to 1968. A journal (1887-1888), general correspondence
(1876-1925), and financial papers (1889-1917) chiefly concern his law
practice and land speculation prior to his return to Washington, D.C., from
St. Louis in 1897. There is an extensive file of college papers while he
attended Princeton University.

The most significant portion of Gist Blair's papers consists of his
historical research files. Blair assumed the role of family historian and
was instrumental in placing in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division
the Andrew Jackson Papers, the Levi Woodbury family papers, the Asa Clapp
family papers, and the Blair family papers. The files contain indexes,
lists, and other material related to the history and ownership of the
Andrew Jackson Papers. Also included are typewritten transcripts of
correspondence between Andrew Jackson and Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876)
written between 1830 and 1845. Blair was also involved in the preparation
of William E. Smith's history of the Blair family and retained Smith's
files of interviews, genealogical data, and related correspondence before
and after the publication in 1933 of his The Francis Preston Blair Family
in Politics.

The papers of Woodbury Blair (1852-1933), lawyer and businessman, span the
period from 1866 to 1892 and chiefly concern the settlement of the estate
of Montgomery and Mary Elizabeth Woodbury Blair. There are a few additional
financial papers, a legal file, and a school catalog.

The series designated as Other Family Papers pertains to individuals
related to the Blair family, most of whom are represented by a small number
of manuscripts. There is, however, a substantial amount of general
correspondence received by Elizabeth Blair Lee, as well as general
correspondence of her husband, Samuel Phillips Lee. A diary (1840-1843)
written by Levi Woodbury, some of his letters received, law lecture notes,
and a miscellany of notes and memoranda are also located in this series.

The Miscellany series contains genealogical material and files relating to
the Silver Spring and Falkland estates in Montgomery County, Maryland, and
to the Blair House at 1651 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.

The Addition includes two drafts of writings by Francis Preston Blair
(1791-1876). The first, probably dated 1832, criticized New York editors
James Watson Webb and Mordecai M. Noah for deserting Andrew Jackson. The
second was written as a newspaper column or a speech probably during the
summer of 1860. The addition also contains a ledger maintained by Charles
Q. Clapp, a merchant in Portland, Maine, between 1822 and 1826 and a
journal kept by Gustavus Vasa Fox between 1851 and 1855 when, on leave from
the navy, he served as an officer on various transatlantic steamships.

Other manuscript collections in the Manuscript Division related directly to
the Blair Family Papers include the Levi Woodbury family papers, the Asa
William Henry Clapp family papers, the Samuel Phillips Lee Papers in the
Naval Historical Foundation Collection, the Breckinridge Long Family
Papers, and the Blair & Rives Papers which relate to the publishing
business partnership of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876) and John C.
Rives.

There are also substantial manuscript collections related to the Blair
family at the Princeton University Library, Stanford University Library,
and the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.
