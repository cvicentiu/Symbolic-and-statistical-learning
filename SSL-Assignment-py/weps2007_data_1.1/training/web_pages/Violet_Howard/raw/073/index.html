    filled a charge of first degree murder against Ches Rodgers, 41, being held in the
    Greene county jail, in connection with the slaying of Edward Franklin Howard, aged 23, of
    Cardwell, at eight o'clock Saturday evening at the corner of East Kingshighway and
    Wall street. Mr. Howard was struck in the top of the head, in the left chest, and
    under the right shoulder blade, in his right side under the arm, and through the left arm
    under the shoulder by .32 caliber pistol bullets, and
    was killed instantly.</b><p><b>Chief of Police Nath Coln said he understood that the
    two men had trouble earlier at the home of Rodgers, on South
    Pekin near the shirt factory, over a poker game and that Mr.
    Howard tried to strike Mr. Rodgers with a chair and later
    with a stick, but others prevented it and talked him into
    leaving. The officer said that Mr. Howard was talking to J.
    C. Fartning near the highway sign on the northwest corner of
    the inter-section, when he saw Mr. Rodgers come around the
    corner of Neal Morrow's cafe on southeast corner.</b></p>
    <p><b>Mr. Coln quoted Mr. Farthing as saying that Mr. Howard
    said he had taken care of one of those he had fought with and
    now he was going to take care of the other as he started
    running toward Mr. Rodgers. Mr. Rodgers is said to have
    opened fire with a .32 caliberSmith and Wessen pistol as the
    younger man neared him. He fell just south of the black line
    in the middle of the highway.</b></p>

    over his left eye during the fight at the Rodgers home when
    hesought to intervene but had been unable to learn of any
    other persons involved in the fight with young Howard. Mr.
    Wilkerson expressed the belief that he was struck
    accindentaliy in seeking to prevent Mr. Howard from striking
    Mr. Rodgers with the stick, the officer said. The officer
    said others at the<a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~argreene"> </a>poker game were Ed Purcell and Shorty
    Cooper. The police chief did not learn just what the trouble
