<P>Shooting Occurs On</P>

<P>Chief Of Police Nath Coln</P>
<P>Says Two Men Had Trouble</P>
<P>Earlier Over Poker Game</P>
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney George W. Butler Today filled a charge of<br> first 
degree
murder against Ches Rodgers, 41, <br>being held in the Greene county jail, in 
connection
with the slaying <br>of Edward Franklin Howard, aged 23, of Cardwell, at eight 
o'clock<br> Saturday evening at the corner of East Kingshighway and Wall street.<br> Mr. Howard 
was
struck in the top of the head, in the left chest,<br> and under the right 
shoulder blade, in his
right side<br> under the arm, and through the left arm under the shoulder by .32 <br>
caliber pistol bullets, and was killed instantly.<br>
<P>Chief of Police Nath Coln said he understood that the two men had trouble<br> 
earlier at
the home of Rodgers, on South Pekin near the shirt factory, <br>over a poker game 
and that Mr. Howard tried to strike Mr. Rodgers with a chair<br> and later with a 
stick, but 
others prevented it and talked him into leaving.<br> The officer said that Mr. 
Howard was
talking to J. C. Fartning near<br> the highway sign on the northwest corner of 
the<br> intersection, when he saw Mr. Rodgers come around the corner of <BR>Neal Morrow's cafe ,
on
southeast corner.<BR></P>
Mr. Coln quoted Mr. Farthing as saying that Mr. Howard said he had taken care<BR> 
of one of those he had fought with and now he was going to take care of the<BR> 
other as he started running toward Mr. Rodgers. Mr. Rodgers is said to have <br>
opened fire with a .32 caliber Smith and Wessen pistol<br> as the younger man neared 
him. He fell just south
of the black line <br>in the middle of the highway.<br></P>
Chief Coln said that Robie Wilkerson received a cut over his left eye during <br>
the fight at the Rodgers home when he sought to intervene but had been <br>unable to 
learn of any other persons involved in the fight with young Howard.<br> Mr. 
Wilkerson expressed the belief that he was struck accindentaliy in seeking to <br>
prevent Mr. Howard from striking Mr. Rodgers with the stick, the officer said.<br> 
The officer said others at the poker game were Ed Purcell and Shorty Cooper.<br> The 
police chief did not learn just what the trouble
was over.<br>
<P>Chief Coln said he learned that Mr. Rodgers was en route to the home of<br> Mr. 
Wilkerson, at the rear of Bob Isom's pool room at the northwest corner<br> of the 
street
intersection. Mr. Rodgers has made <br>no statement to officers concerning the 
shooting.<br>
<P>Chief Coln said that he was told that when young Howard left Rodger's home <br>
after the fight he had threatened to get Mr. Rodgers <br>if it took hot lead to do 
it.<br>
<P>Following the shooting, Mr. Rodgers took six empty cartridge shells <br>from his 
pistol and handed the weapon to James Hyde, former constable.<br> Mr. Rodgers 
surrendered
to police officers when they arrived at the scene<br> and Mr. Hyde turned the 
pistol over to police at local headquarters.<br> Mr.Rodgers was later turned over to 
County Sheriff Fred W. Gray.<br>
<P>Mr. Howard was born at Beach Grove. He was employed at odd jobs.<br> Althought 
his
home was at Cardwell, he resided part time with his grandmother,<br> Mrs. Wyoma 
Howard of Paragould, and other relatives here.<br>
<P>The body was carried to the Randal L. Mitchell Funeral Home<br> following the 
shooting
and was later removed to A. J. Emerson Funeral Home <br>and prepared for 
burial.<br>
<P>Funeral arrangements are incomplete.<br>
Surviving are his wife,<br> Mrs. Rochelle Howard, a son, Paul Howard,<br> a sister, 
Mrs.
Theodore Thompson of Live Oak, Calf. <br>a half sister, Miss Violet Howard of 
Cardwell<br>
a brother, Charlie Howard of Paragould:<br> two half brothers, Frank and George 
Randal
Howard of Cardwell;<br> his mother, Mrs. Grace Hafford of Paragould;<br> and his 
father,
George Howard of Cardwell.<br> He was the grandson of<br> Mrs. Wyoma Howard of 
Paragould and Mrs. Pearlie Howard of Cardwell.<br>
<P>Since writing the forgoing, it was learned that the preliminarmy hearing of <br>
Mr. Rodgers would be held at 2:30 Wednesday afternoon before <br>Justice of the 
Peace
A. D. Jackson. Officers quoted Archie Brooks a witness, <br>as saying that 
shortly before
the shooting, young Howard <br>told him that Mr. Rodgers had won $11 from him by 
allegedly <br>using marked cards and that he intented to get it back some way.<br><p>
