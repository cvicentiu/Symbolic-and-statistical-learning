<a name="Anchor-421-22329"></a>421 CORPORATION, et al. 
VS. 
METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE,
et al.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:  

Joel H. Moseley and Robert W. Rutherford, Nashville, Tennessee, for
the appellants, 421 Corporation and Mike Sokolic.

James L. Murphy, Lizabeth D. Foster, and Francis H. Young, Nashville,
Tennessee, for the appellees, Metropolitan Government of Nashville and
Davidson County, Tennessee and the Metropolitan Board of Zoning
Appeals.

Judge:  KOCH

First Paragraph:

This appeal involves a dispute between a sexually oriented business
and a city over the business's desire to expand onto adjoining
property.  After the city's board of zoning appeals denied its
application for a building permit because the business had not met the
requirements for the expansion of a nonconforming use, the business
filed a petition for a common-law writ of certiorari in the Chancery
Court for Davidson County asserting that it had satisfied the city's
standards for expanding a nonconforming use and that the board was
selectively enforcing the city's land use regulations.  The trial
court, sitting without a jury, rejected both claims and affirmed the
board's decision.  On this appeal, the business renews the same
arguments that proved unsuccessful below.  We have determined that the
board correctly interpreted the city's land use regulations and that
the selective enforcement allegations fail to state a claim for which
relief can be granted.  Accordingly, we affirm the order dismissing
the petition for writ of certiorari.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:  

Robert L. Jackson, Stanley A. Kweller, Nashville, Tennessee, for the
appellants, Raymond Keith Hudson.

John J. Hollins, Jr., Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellee, Debra A.
Bullington.

Judge: CAIN

First Paragraph:

This appeal involves a father's child support obligation.  After the
child's mother filed a petition to increase child support, the trial
court increased the amount of child support prospectively as well as
retrospectively for a period of seven years prior to the mother's
petition to increase support.  The court's retrospective modification
was effected by a correction of the prior support order pursuant to
Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.01.  We hold that the court erred
in its retroactive modification of child support as well as in its
decision not to award the wife attorney fees below.

RICHARD DIETZ, II, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF BARBARA DIETZ, et al.
VS. 
CHARLES A. KEITH, et al.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:  

Cherie S. Adams and Jill R. Rayburn, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the
appellants, Richard Dietz, II, Executor of the Estate of Barbara
Dietz, and Jose Flores.

Cecil W. Laws and W. Carr Hagan, Jr., Kingsport, Tennessee, for the
appellees, Charles A. Keith and MiniFibers, Inc.

Judge:  SUSANO

First Paragraph:

Barbara Dietz and Jose Flores, former corporate officers of 
MiniFibers, Inc. (&quot;the corporation&quot;), brought this action after the
corporation terminated their employment.  They contend that they are
each entitled to one-third of the outstanding common stock of the
corporation.  The trial court granted the defendants -- the
corporation and Charles A. Keith -- summary judgment, holding that the
plaintiffs were judicially estopped from claiming any ownership
interest in the corporation.  The plaintiffs appeal, arguing that the
defendants are not entitled to summary judgment.  The defendants, on
the other hand, argue that summary judgment is appropriate on one or
more of the following grounds: (1) judicial estoppel; (2) statute of
limitations; (3) laches; (4) equitable estoppel; and (5) that the
promise to transfer stock is an unenforceable gift.  We vacate the
judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.

ALANA DOWELL, et al. 
VS. 
JESSE C. MINOR, et al.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:

Hugh C. Howser, Jr. and Kenneth Mark Bryant, Nashville, Tennessee, for
the appellants, Evylee Minor and Leann Morrison.

Hal Hardin, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Jesse C. Minor.

Nadar Baydoun and Stephen C. Knight, Nashville, Tennessee, for the
appellees, Alana Dowell and Debra Fleming.

Judge:  KOCH

First Paragraph:

This interlocutory appeal involves the appointment of a guardian ad
litem for a 73-year-old prisoner who is a defendant in a proceeding
pending in the Circuit Court for Davidson County.  The prisoner's
daughter requested to be appointed as her father's guardian ad litem
because he is unable to effectively assist with his defense.  The
trial court denied the petition but granted the daughter's petition
for an interlocutory appeal.  We concur with the trial court that an
interlocutory appeal will prevent needless, expensive, and protracted
litigation.  Accordingly, we grant the interlocutory appeal and
reverse the order denying the petition for the appointment of a
guardian ad litem in accordance with Tenn. Ct. App. R. 10(b).

RICHARD FELDMAN 
VS. 
TENNESSEE BOARD OF MEDICAL  EXAMINERS

Court:TCA

Attorneys:   

Frank J. Scanlon, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Richard
Feldman.

Paul G. Summers, Attorney General and Reporter, Michelle Hohnke Joss,
Assistant Attorney General, for the appellee, Tennessee Board of
Medical Examiners.

Judge:  CANTRELL

First Paragraph:

The Board of Medical Examiners disciplined a physician for
&quot;unprofessional, dishonorable or unethical conduct,&quot; and placed his
license on probation for one year, with continuation of his practice
subject to conditions which included obtaining the &quot;advocacy&quot; of
another doctor.  The following year, the Board issued a new notice of
charges, alleging failure to comply with the conditions in the
probationary order.  After a hearing, the Board found the physician
guilty of the new charges, and placed his license on probation for
five years, with new conditions placed upon the continuation of his
practice.  The physician petitioned the chancery court for judicial
review of the Board's action.  The chancellor affirmed the order of
the Board.  On appeal, we affirm the new order of probation, but
reverse as to those conditions which are unsupported by the evidence
in the record.

DEBORAH ANN HANSEN 
VS.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:  

David E. Fowler, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the appellant, Ole
Hansen.

Don W. Poole, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the appellant, Deborah Ann
Hansen.

Judge:  SUSANO

First Paragraph:

This is a divorce case.  The trial court entered a judgment
establishing a residential schedule for the parties' minor child;
designating Deborah Ann Hansen (&quot;Mother&quot;) the &quot;primary custodian&quot; of 
the child; and ordering Ole Hansen (&quot;Father&quot;) to pay child support of
$315 per month.   Father appeals, arguing that the trial court erred
in refusing to alternate the designation of primary residential parent
between the parties on an annual basis when, according to Father, the
parenting plan adopted by the trial court demonstrates that the
parties are, in fact, equal custodians of the child.  He also contends
that the trial court erred when it stated that the designation of one
parent as the primary residential parent is a designation &quot;in name
only.&quot;  In addition, Father contends that the trial court erred in
setting his child support obligation.  We affirm.

implied easement for a driveway and parking area adjacent to her home.
 The appellants assert that the evidence preponderates against the
court's finding.  We affirm.

Plaintiff brought an action for the wrongful removal of a tractor

compensatory damage was settled between the parties by the defendant
paying plaintiff $2,500.00.  The Trial Judge had granted partial
summary judgment to defendant on the issue of punitive damages, and

punitive damages.

claiming that the trial court's judgment fails to return the parties
to the status quo before the sale.  We affirm.

Judge:  HIGHERS

First Paragraph:

This appeal involves a dispute over whether a contract to provide
services was formed between defendant-city and plaintiff-engineers and
if so, whether defendant-city breached the contract.  The court below
held that a contract was formed between the parties and granted
plaintiff-engineers recovery under the contract.  In the alternative,
the trial court held that plaintiff-engineers would be entitled to
recover in quantum meruit in the absence of a valid contract. 
Defendant-city appeals.

Court:TCA

Attorneys:

Philip Elbert and Kendra Samson, Nashville, Tennessee, for the
appellants, George Pryor and Sharon Pryor.

Michael Mills and Bryan Smith, Brentwood, Tennessee, for the
appellees, Tim Willoughby and Jane Willoughby.

Judge:  CANTRELL

First Paragraph:

This case involves the proper measure of damages on a nuisance claim. 
The trial court awarded the plaintiffs damages for the cost of
restoring their property to the condition it was in before the
defendants' negligence caused their septic system to back up and
overflow into their house.  The court also awarded them damages for
discomfort, inconvenience, embarrassment and emotional distress.  The
plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, arguing that
they were entitled to additional damages, measured by the decline in
the rental value of their property during the time that the nuisance
persisted.  The trial court denied the motion because the plaintiffs
never rented out their house, but continued to reside in it despite
the existence of the nuisance.  We find that the plaintiffs are
entitled to compensation for the loss of use and enjoyment of their
property, measured by the decline in its rental value, and we
accordingly reverse the trial court.

Judge:  SWINEY

First Paragraph:

Plaintiff, Terry Traylor, alleged in his Complaint that he was
terminated from his job at Wheland Foundry because he filed a workers'
compensation claim for benefits.  Defendant, North American Royalties,
Inc., d/b/a/ Wheland Foundry, filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.  
At the hearing on that Motion, Defendant argued that it fired
Plaintiff in accordance with the company's Absence Control Program and
not because of his workers' compensation claim. The Trial Court
granted the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.  In this appeal,
Plaintiff argues that there are genuine issues of material fact
requiring a trial, and, therefore, the Trial Court erred in granting
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.  The judgment of the Trial
Court is affirmed.

Clark Lee Shaw, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Susan Lynn

Judge:  CLARK

First Paragraph:

This case involves the legality of an order by which the trial court
&quot;permanently terminated&quot; a mother's visitation rights with her minor
son.  The trial court dismissed the mother's petition for a
reinstatement of visitation on the basis that it had permanently
terminated her visitation rights several years earlier.  On appeal,
the mother argues that it was unlawful for the trial court to
permanently terminate her visitation rights.  We agree with the Mother
and hold that the trial court's order must be reversed and this case
remanded to the trial court for a hearing on the mother's petition to
reinstate visitation.

Judge:  GLENN

First Paragraph:

Based upon a tip from a confidential informant that the defendant was
transporting illegal drugs, law enforcement officers stopped the
defendant's vehicle.  Following an &quot;alert&quot; by a drug-sniffing dog,
officers searched the defendant, his vehicle, and the car hauler he
was operating.  Cocaine was found both on the defendant's person and
in the console of the car he was hauling.  After the court overruled
the defendant's motion to suppress the search and seizure, he was
convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture, sell,
or deliver.  He appealed his conviction, asserting that the stop and
search were illegal.  Based upon our review, we affirm the judgment of
the trial court.

its discretion by revoking the defendant's probation where there is no
evidence the defendant's non-compliance was due to willful and
deliberate refusal to make payments as ordered by the trial court.
