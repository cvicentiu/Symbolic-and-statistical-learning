<B>SIDNEY O. FULLER</B><BR>Comfortably located on an excellent farm on section 34, in Cambria township, which comprises eighty acres of, fertile and well tilled land, and is provided with substantial and convenient buildings of ample capacity, Sidney O. FULLER, one of the "old -timers," and skillful and progressive farmers of the township, is passing the evening of his life in cheerfulness and peace, secure against the adverse winds of fortune and well established in the confidence and esteem of his fellow men. He is a native of Washington county, New York, born on June 18, 1823, and was reared and educated in his native county, receiving there a common school education and also learning on his father's farm lasting lessons of industry and frugality. There also he was united in marriage with Miss Miranda FULLER, a native of the same county.<P>His parents were Cornelius and Lydia (French) FULLER, both children of Revolutionary heroes. His maternal grandfather, John French, was captured by the Indians while serving in the Colonial army and was held in captivity by his savage tormentors for three years. He finally escaped by creeping through the forest and wet swamps at night, going three days without food, but he was very soon thereafter taken prisoner again by another tribe, later escaping from his second captors in the same manner as before. When the War of 1812 began he again shouldered his musket and fought gallantly in that contest against the enemies of his country.<P>Cornelius FULLER grew to manhood in New York state and learned his trade as a carpenter. He was drafted in the War of 1812, and served the required time with credit and courage His family numbered ten children, of whom Sidney was the ninth born. In 1845 he came with his parents and three others of their ten children to Michigan and settled with them on a tract of new and unbroken land near Woodbridge township, in this county. They remained on this land a few years, then sold it and bought another tract in the same neighborhood. A little later they removed to Woodbridge township, and here both parents died, the mother at middle age in 1853, and the father in 1865, when about seventy. He was a republican in political faith in the closing years of his life and the mother was a devout member of the Baptist church.<P>Mr. Sidney O. FULLER's own life has passed wholly amid the elevating and tranquilising pursuits of agriculture, and more than fifty of its best years have been given to the development and improvement of this county. He came here when the whole section was a wilderness and has lived to see it rejoicing in the products of peace and cultivated life, full well advanced on a career of prosperity and commercial, agricultural, educational and moral greatness, that may well make him justly proud of his share in working out the beneficent results of the systematic labor which has been expended upon it. He and his wife were the parents of two children, Danvers and Matilda, who died young. They then adopted as their own, Albert E. FULLER, a son of Samuel FULLER, whom they carefully reared and educated. When he reached years of maturity, on May 3, 1887, he married with Miss Mary McNAMARA, a native of Stoughton, Mass., and a daughter of John and Mary McNAMARA, who came to Michigan while she was yet a child. They have one child, Eugene, who is living at home.<P>On this family the shadow of the Civil War, which almost rent our country in twain, rested heavily. Mrs. FULLER's father, John McNAMARA, was a soldier in the Union army and died a wretched prisoner amid the horrors of captivity at Andersonville, and Albert E. FULLER's father, Samuel, and brother James, who were both members of the Tenth Michigan Infantry, also died in the service, the former from exposure and the latter from wounds received in battle. The father was buried in the National Cemetery at Chattanooga.<P>Sidney O. FULLER's faithful and devoted wife, after walking life's troubled way with him for more than half a century, died on December 26, 1896, and since that time he has been quietly wai
Schullerville, N. Y., where he was engaged as a miller, and died at an advanced age. In the meantime, however, he had shouldered his musket again, and fought the enemies of his country in the War of 1812.<P>After marriage the parents of our subject settled on a farm near Lawrenceberg, Warren Co., N. Y., whence they removed to Saratoga County, later to Washington County, and finally Wayne County. About 1845 the parents and four of their ten children came to Michigan, and located on a tract of new land near Woodbridge Township, where they lived a few years, then sold, and purchased again in the same locality, The mother died about 1853 in middle life, in Woodbridge Township. Cornelius FULLER spent his last years in Woodbridge Township, passing away in 1865, when about seventy years of age. He was a Republican during the last years of his life, and the mother was a devout member of the Baptist Church. Three of their children are now living,(1888) and residents mostly of Michigan.<P>Sidney O. FULLER was the ninth child of his parents, and in common with his brothers and sisters acquired a common-school education, and was reared to habits of industry. He was married, in New York State, to Miss Marinda FULLER, who was born and reared in Washington County, N. Y., and by her union with our subject became the mother of two children, Danvers and Matilda, who both died young. They have now an adopted son, Albert E. FULLER, who is married, and lives on a farm in Cambria Township.<P>Mr. FULLER is a man of intelligence, and keeps himself well posted on current events, although steadily declining to become an office-holder, for the responsibilities of which his townsmen have considered him eminently fitted, and have often desired him to take. He votes the straight Republican ticket, and, with his estimable wife, is a member in good standing of the Baptist Church.

<B>REUBEN J. FULLER</B><BR>
REUBEN J FULLER, whose name appears frequently in the foregoing list, came from Sullivan, Madison Co., N.Y., with his family, and settled on section 10 in Adams on the 2d of February, 1837. His location is immediately east of the village of North Adams. He purchased the south 40 of his 80 in 1835, and has resided upon his place since his settlement in 1837. (History of Hillsdale County, Michigan Everts & Abbott 1879 pg. 223)<P>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<B>PERRY HOPKINS</B><BR>
PERRY HOPKINS is prominently identified with the industrial interests of Hillsdale County, as a farmer, stock-raiser and cooper, being very prosperously engaged in these pursuits on section 11 of Woodbridge Township. He was born in New York State, Nov. 29, 1831, and is the son of the late David and Olive (Larrabee) HOPKINS, natives respectively of Connecticut and New York, the father born in 1800 and the mother in 1804. In 1836 they came to Michigan and located in Rome, Lenawee County, where Mr. HOPKINS industriously pursued his occupation of farmer until his death in 1866. He had received his education in the common schools, and was an intelligent man, much respected by all for his virtuous, upright life, and was a stanch adherent of the Quaker society. His wife was a Close Communion Baptist, and an earnest Christian; she survived him some years, dying in 1872. They had seven children, namely: Perry (our subject), Trueman, Lodema, Susanna, Polly, Martha and Lucinda. Mr. HOPKINS also had four children by a former marriage - David, Russell, Amanda and Nancy.<P>He of whom we write, coming to Michigan when a small boy in the very early days of the settlement of the southern part of this State, was reared in the pioneer home of his parents in the township of Rome, Lenawee County. He endured with them all the privations and hardships of such a life, where, though they had plenty to eat, as wild game was abundant, many things now considered absolutely indispensable to comfort were sadly lacking. However, they were unneeded to develop in the young lad vigor of mind and body, and a manly self-reliance, which enabled him at the age of eighteen years to start out into the world, poor indeed in purse, but rich in spirit and energy. He learned the cooper's trade and for ten years followed it very successfully, thus acquiring considerable property, which enabled him to establish himself as a farmer, and in February, 1861, he purchased eighty acres of forest covered land, which now forms a part of his present farm. In the month of March he commenced to fell the trees on his land to make room and material to build a log house, into which he and his family moved in the month of may, before it was provided with either door or window. Since that time he has steadily made his way to an assured success, until now he owns one of the finest farms in this county, and has increased its area to 160 acres of rich and highly fertile land, on which he has made many valuable improvements. He has paid much attention to the breeding of high grades of horses and cattle, and is quite famous for his fine Hambletonians and Short-horns. He has erected a fine, commodious brick house, at a cost of $3,000, with a slate roof and handsomely furnished inside; it has two cellars, and its dimensions are: the main part 16x24, two stories in height; two wings, 16x16 and 18x21, and a kitchen 10x21. He built in 1884 a substantial barn at a cost of $1,500., 44x68 feet in dimensions, with 20-foot posts, 33,000 shingles covering the roof, and a basement eighty feet high under the center, in which are built thirty cords of stone.<P>  Mr. HOPKINS was married to Miss Betsy A. BARNUM, July 2, 1853, and she has since been to him a most faithful and helpful wife, to whom much of his prosperity is due. She was born Oct. 18, 1830, in New York State, and was a daughter of Zar and Margaret (German) BARNUM, also natives of York State. They came to Michigan in 1840, and are now both deceased. Her father was a farmer and also a cabinet-maker. He was an active and esteemed member of the Baptist Church. The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. HOPKINS has been productive of four children, of whom the following is the record: Adolphus died at the age of twenty; Madora, who died Aug. 4, 1880, was the wife of Dr. STEARNS, of Frontier, having been one of the first teachers in that town, and was very highly educated; Elfred was born in Franklin Township, Lenawee County; Orson was born Sept. 10, 1864, and is married to Luella POINTER. Elfred married, Oct. 2, 1884, Melissa CULBERTSON, who was born in Ohio, in 1859, and came to Michigan in 1882; they have one child, Alice M., born Dec. 29, 1887<BR>
Our subject and his wife occupy a good social position in this community, and are greatly respected by the people for their genuine worth and integrity, and their hospitable home is ever open to numerous friends. In his political views Mr. HOPKINS is an advocate of the Greenback party, while his sons are Democrats.<P>

<B>WARREN STURDEVANT</B><BR> Warren STURDEVANT, a gentleman in the prime of life, actively engaged in agricultural pursuits in Cambria Township, has a finely improved farm of 120 acres on section 24. Besides this property he owns ninety acres on section 25, the greater part of which is in a productive condition. He has been a resident of this county for over thirty years, and is numbered among its solid and reliable men.<P>Our subject was born in Tompkins County, N.Y., April 2, 1844, and is the son of Elias L. and Olive (LEONARD) STURDEVANT, who were also natives of the Empire State. The paternal grandfather, Joseph STURDEVANT, was also born there, but spent a good share of his life in Pennsylvania, where he followed the trade of shoemaker; when a young man he served as a soldier in the War of 1812. Quite late in life he came to Michigan, and died in Woodbridge Township, Hillsdale County, in 1863, when seventy-seven years old. He had been twice married, and was in all respects a most estimable citizen.<P>Elias L. STURDEVANT, the father of our subject, spent his boyhood and youth in his native State, and was married in Tompkins County. After the birth of five children the parents removed to Fulton County, Ohio, living there one year, during which time they lost one son by death. About 1853 they came to this state locating first in Medina Township, Lenawee County, whence later they removed to a new farm in Wright Township, this county, which the father purchased, made some improvements, and then selling out invested a part of his capital in forty acres in Woodbridge Township. This property, a few years later, he traded for a farm in Ransom Township, which he occupied two years, then returned to Woodbridge Township, whence he again removed to Cambria Township, settling this time on forty acres on section 24, where he still lives. He is now seventy-five years old, a hard-working honest man, in early life a Whig, politically, and later a Republican. The wife and mother still continues the faithful partner of her aged husband, and is sixty-seven years old.<P>To Elias L. and Olive STURDEVANT there were born nine children, five sons and four daughters; one of the former and two of the latter are deceased. The living children are all married and settled in comfortable homes. Warren, our subject, acquired his education in the district schools, and in early manhood served an apprenticeship at the carpenter's trade; he followed this some years, and put up many excellent houses both in this county and in Eaton. He was first married, in Cambria Township, to Miss Helen REYNOLDS, who was born in Branch County, this State, in 1849, and a history of whose father, Chancy REYNOLDS, will be found on another page in this volume. Mrs. Helen STURDEVANT died at her home in Cambria Township, Sept. 9, 1871. She had no children.<P>Our subject contracted a second marriage in Cambria Township, this county, Nov. 20, 1875, with Mrs. Esther (MILES) HALL, who was born in California Township, Branch County, this State, March 18, 1849, and is the daughter of Chancy and Mary A. (REYNOLDS) Miles, who died some years ago, the father at Pilot Knob., Mo. About 1862, when forty-six years of age. The mother passed away some five years before the death of her husband, her death taking place in Branch County about 1857, when she was forty years old. They were natives respectively of Connecticut and New York, and were married in Branch County, this State. Mr. MILES was a well-educated man and followed teaching considerably during the younger years of his life. Later he engaged in farming.<P>The wife of our subject was first married in Adrian, Michigan, to Andrew HALL, a farmer by occupation, and who, during the late war, served as a Union soldier about three years in Company F, 2nd Michigan Infantry. After receiving his honorable discharge he returned to Cambria Township, from which he had enlisted, and died on the 28th of May, 1873. He left a wife and three children, one of whom, Eugene, died at the age of fifteen years; Harry and Bert, twenty-one and seventeen years of age, are living with their mother and stepfather. By this marriage Mr. STURDEVANT is the father of three children- Andrew W., Elias L., Jr., and Minerva E.  the family residence is a well-built structure, convenient and substantial, and the other improvements of the homestead bear fair comparison with those of the intelligent farmers around. Mr. S. gives most of his attention to his agricultural pursuits and his personal affairs, having no desire for the responsibilities of office. He keeps himself well posted, however, upon current events, and uniformly votes the Republican ticket.<P>

<B>HENRY H. HOPKINS</B><BR>
HENRY H. HOPKINS<BR>One of the leading business men and substantial property owners of Hillsdale, Michigan, is the subject of this sketch, Henry H. HOPKINS, a native of the state of New York, born in Yates county, on September 28, 1839, the son of Thomas and Orphia (Pierce) HOPKINS, both natives of the county of Putnam, in the same state. His father was engaged in merchandising, and he also followed the occupation of farming to a limited extent, during the early years of his life. In 1878 he disposed of his business and property in New York, and removed with his family to the city of Marshall, Michigan, where he and his wife continued to reside up to the time of their deaths in 1882. During the New York residence of Thomas HOPKINS, he was somewhat active in local politics from time to time, and for several years he held various local offices. For the long period of seventeen years he was the court-crier, and was one of the respected citizens and trustworthy officials of that section of the state. The paternal grandfather of H. H. HOPKINS was Jeremiah HOPKINS, an early settler of Putnam county, New York, and for many years one of its leading citizens, being also prominent in the circles of the Masonic fraternity. His maternal grandfather, Bizer PIERCE, was one of the early showmen of New York state, widely known throughout the Eastern and Middle States. He lived to the great age of ninety-nine years.<P>Henry H. HOPKINS, of this review, was one of a family of ten children, four of whom are still residents of the state of Michigan. He received his early education, and attained man's estate in New York. After the completion of his education, he first engaged in farming, subsequently learning the harness trade, thereafter following the occupation of manufacturing harness. Subsequently, he disposed of this business to advantage, and for twenty-five years engaged successfully in selling musical instruments. In 1873 he removed his residence to the city of Toledo, Ohio, and, in 1876, he again removed to the city of Hudson, Michigan, where he remained until 1879, when he established himself in his present home at Hillsdale, Michigan. In 1881, he entered upon the manufacture and sale of "Professor HOPKINS Indian blood remedy", which is now fully established as a popular and a reliable medicine, and he has been very successful in this enterprise. The remedy enjoys an extensive sale throughout the United States and Canada, and the business is fast attaining large proportions. In the year 1877, Mr. HOPKINS was united in marriage at Hudson, Michigan, with Miss Malinda KNAPP, a native of Wheatland township, this county. Politically, Mr. HOPKINS is identified with the Republican party, and takes an active and leading interest in public affairs, although he has never been a seeker for office. By industry, ability, and careful attention to business, he has built up a large, successful and constantly growing business, and he is one of the representative men of the community of his residence.

<B>HENRY HINKLE</B><BR>HENRY HINKLE, who so ably guided the fortunes of Woodbridge township for five years as its supervisor, is a native of Hillsdale county, born in Wright township on November 7, 1851. His parents were Samuel D. and Salora (Benedict) HINKLE, the former a native of Pennsylvania and the latter of New York. The father was both a blacksmith and a farmer and carried on thriving industries in both occupations, first in his native state and, after 1856, in Michigan, moving here in that year and settling on eighty acres of unbroken forest land in Wright township. He resided on this tract until 1867 and devoted his best efforts to clearing it for cultivation and making it productive as a farm and comfortable as a home. In the year last named he traded it for a farm in Cambria township, to which he moved his family and on which he passed the rest of his life, dying in 1881, leaving a widow who still survives him and makes her home with her children. They were the parents of eleven children, all of whom are living. Both were earnest and serviceable members of the Methodist Episcopal church. The paternal grandfather was a native of Pennsylvania, a blacksmith by trade and an early settler near Columbus, Ohio, where the remaining years of his life were passed.<P>Henry HINKLE grew to man's estate in Hillsdale county, and got his education in the public schools. He began life for himself as a farmer on the old home on which he lived, engaged in this cultivation for five years. He then purchased a threshing outfit and used it to the great advantage of the farmers in all parts of the county for two years, after that dealing in farm produce for a year. Some time later he bought the farm of 128 acres on which he now lives in Woodbridge township and which has ever since been his home. Into its improvement and cultivation he has put the energy and skill of his more mature years and has made it an impressive illustration of what systematic and intelligent industry can accomplish, it being now one of the model farms of the township, yielding abundant returns for the faith and toil involved in its tillage. He was married in this county, in 1876? to Miss Sarah FULLER, a daughter of David and Olive FULLER, early settlers of Woodbridge township, both of whom are now deceased. Mr. and Mrs. HINKLE have six children: Olive, engaged in teaching at Albion; Elva, an instructor in a school at Hillsdale; Grace, a popular teacher of Detroit; Elizabeth, Florence and David at home. The first three are graduates of the State Normal School. For many years after reaching his majority Mr. HINKLE was a Republican in political faith; but he is now a Free-Silver Democrat. He has been active in behalf of the advancement and development of the township, and has served its people well as supervisor, first in 1891, 1892 and 1893, and again in 1895 and 1896. He has also taken a great and serviceable interest in educational matters and has filled with credit and advantage to the community several school offices. He is a member of the Patrons of Husbandry, being active in the affairs of the grange at Cambria.  (Compendium of History and Biography of Hillsdale County, Michigan, Elon G.

<B>ANDREW REYNOLDS</B><BR>ANDREW REYNOLDS, a thrifty farmer and stock-raiser of Cambria Township, is pleasantly located, with his land lying on sections 25 and 36; besides general farming, he gives a large share of his attention to the raising of Durham cattle and Poland-China swine. The most of his land, comprising a good farm of 275 acres, is in a productive condition, and his residence occupies a pleasant situation in the southern part of section 25.<P>Mr. Reynolds, a gentleman in the prime of life, was born in the township of California, Branch County, this State, Oct. 30, 1846. His father, Chancy Reynolds, was born in Lyons, Wayne Co., N. Y., and was the son of Joseph Reynolds, one of the most thrifty farmers of the Empire State. Grandfather Reynolds left his native soil after reaching middle life, and took up his abode in Branch County, three miles from any house, in the township of California. There he spent his last years, continuing a tiller of the soil, and surrounded himself with many comforts before his death, which occurred in 1850 or 1851.<P>Joseph Reynolds, upon reaching manhood, took up, like his father before him, a tract of Government land sometime in the thirties and continued a resident of Branch County the remainder of his life, he and his excellent wife passing away within a few days of each other, both at the age of sixty-five years.<P>Chancy Reynolds was but a boy when he came with his parents to Branch County, this State, and upon reaching manhood sought his wife among the maidens of Bedford, Monroe County, being married, about 1841, to Miss Triphena TUTTLE, who was also a native of New York State, and came to Michigan with her parents during its Territorial days. The young people after their marriage located upon a tract of land in California Township, Branch County, where the father labored industriously as a tiller of the soil, and was rewarded in due time by the possession of a fertile farm, supplied with good buildings, and all the other appurtenances of a comfortable home. They endured hardships and privations, and practiced the most rigid economy. The first meal in their new home was cooked by the side of a stump, and eaten from the same dish. They worked together with one common purpose, and about 1848, having a chance to dispose of their property to good advantage, sold out in Branch County, and took up a tract of eighty acres of wild land in Camden Township, this county, which was then far from any neighbors, and where they nearly repeated the process through which they had gone in Branch County. Upon this, however, they resided but a few years, and selling out once more, the father purchased 120 acres in Camden Township, which he cultivated for a time, then sold out again, and purchased eighty acres in Reading Township. Upon this he made some improvements, but removed from it in 1852 to the northeast quarter of section 36, Cambria Township, purchasing also at the same time twenty acres in Jefferson Township adjoining. This also was a wild and unbroken tract, but the father seemed to delight in subduing the wilderness, and here also effected a great change in the primitive condition of the soil. He also put up two houses with the other needed buildings and here continued to reside until his death which took place Aug. 18, 1865.<P>The father of our subject, in addition to his farming  ?, dealt considerably in real estate, buying and selling extensively. At the same time he took a lively interest in township affairs, and was a staunch supporter of Democratic principles. The mother survived her husband until 1880, dying February 21 of that year, at the home of our subject, in Cambria Township. She had been a true helpmate to her husband, who, without her ready cooperation, would probably have fallen far short of that which he was enabled to accomplish.<P>To Chancy Reynolds and his excellent wife there were born eleven children, six sons and five daughters, seven of whom lived to mature years, and are all married and settled in this State. Andrew, our subject, is the third eldest living. He
Mrs. Reynolds was born in Sodus Township, Wayne Co., N. Y., April 26, 1851, the daughter of Alcanzer and Amanda (Hopkins) Fuller, also natives of Wayne County, N. Y., where they were married, and whence they removed to Michigan, when their daughter Amanda(?) was an infant four months old. The father, a carpenter by trade, followed his occupation until removing to Woodbridge Township, this county, where he purchased a small tract of land, thirty-five acres in extent, which he improved and added to until he is now the owner of a good farm of 110 acres, with convenient and substantial buildings. Mr. Fuller is fifty-eight years of age, and his estimable wife sixty-one. Their family included three daughters, who are now residing in Michigan.<P>
Mrs. Reynolds continued under the parental roof until her marriage, and is now the mother of two interesting children, a daughter and son, Eva A. and Chancy, who are pursuing their studies in the district school. Mr. Reynolds, politically, has affiliated with the Democratic party since becoming a voter. Their neat homestead invariably attracts the eye of the passing traveler, and in all its surroundings indicates the thrift and industry of the proprietor.

HOPKINS</B><BR>Mrs. Hannah (MILES) HOPKINS who was prostrated by a stroke of apoplexy  Monday morning passed peacefully away Saturday afternoon, June 18, 1892 at the residence of Frank E. WILLETT, where she had been making her home much of the time during the past few years. The deceased whose maiden name was MILES, was born in Homer, Cortland Co., New York, May 20, 1821. In June 1839 she came to Flint, and on January 14, 1847, she was united in marriage to Henry HOPKINS, who died in September 1853. On April 18, 1864 she was married to George S.

<B>MICHIGAN PIONEERS AND HISTORICAL COLLECTION</B>, Vol. 29 1899-1900 pg. 454<BR><B>James and Thomas SARGENT, Jr</B>., twin sons of Thomas SARGENT, early pioneers of Kent Co. [Michigan], died a few years ago, but their death was not chronicled in the memoirs of the pioneers of the county, yet they were conspicuous figures of the early days because of the close resemblance of each to the other so marked and close with this appearance that their most intimate friends could not name them correctly with any degree of certainty. For several years they were employed on a steamer plying between Grand Rapids and Grand Haven and when referred to by travelers, or teamsters, were always as "Tom or John, I declare, I don't know which". After the death of their father, they succeeded him in the street sprinkling and ice business and for years were well known figures upon the streets of that city. The close resemblance continued through life.<P>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<B>EVALINE A HIGLEY</B><BR>EVALINE A HIGLEY, daughter of Andrew and Rhoda [FULLER] Reynolds of Frontier was born in Cambria Twp, Hillsdale Co. Michigan January 27, 1876 died in Frontier, MI November 10, 1911 age 35 yrs. 10 mo 21 days. In her early years after finishing a course in a rural school, she attended Hillsdale college pursuing the regular course of the senior year when owing to a decline of health, she deemed it advisable to cease her collegiate studies. She had also pursued the course in the conservatory of music. She joined in marriage Herman O. HIGLEY October 14, 1897. For about the period of a year at each place, they dwelt at Woodbridge, Reading, Cambria thence Frontier where they have lived the most of the time of their married life. For a period of about 2  years, before her mothers death, which occurred in the autumn of 1903, she remained at her childhood home to assist in the household cares and since that time has had that home as well as her own constantly on her mind always looking after the welfare of her father and brother. Her health has not been robust for a number of years but the suddenness of her death startled the community. Thursday she had been to Hillsdale and enjoyed the long walks which she took, feeling better than usual on Friday morning. When she had dinner almost ready and asking her husband to assist in some household cares which he attended, she called his name hurridly to which he at once responded and found that a violent hemorrage from the lungs or throat had set in. In less than 4 minutes her heart ceased beating. Her funeral occurred Sunday, the funeral discourse being delivered by Rev. W.H. Clay the minister who had officiated at her wedding. Her life commanded the respect of ever community in which her lot was cast. She was sympathetic, a lover of pets, never trifling and though often sufferer, refused to repose her sufferings by complaint to others. Her departure is a distinct loss to the community as well as to her husband, brother and other dear relatives. (Hillsdale Newspaper Obit Nov. 1911)<P>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

FITZGERALD – In Ransom, May 11, 1880, of ulceration of the stomach. Mr. James F. Fitzgerald, sen., aged 79 years, 9 months and 9 days.<BR>
The subject of this notice was born in Orange county N.Y. From thence he removed to Alleghany county in the same State, where he resided until 1865, when he removed to Ransom, Michigan., where he remained until his death. Mr. F. was one of our most worthy and respected citizens, and will be greatly missed, not only by his wife, with whom he has lived for nearly 60 years, and children and near relatives, but by his large circle of friends and the community in general. He was a consistent and every day Christian, having been a professor of religion for over 60 years, and a consistent and worthy member of the Congregational church in Ransom since his settlement in that town. He retained his senses until his last moments and gave directions concerning his funeral with the same composure that a man would if he were merely starting on a journey, and expected to return to see if his orders were fulfilled. He requested that Wm. MABBS preach his funeral service, that the choir of the Congregational church sing at the grave, "Hark! From the tomb the doleful sound;" gave orders concerning the place where he desired to be buried; and he also selected Lewis THOMPSON to take charge at the funeral. In all matters that required candor and stability he was frank, and plain in conversation, and a fearless advocate of truth and right regardless of the frowns of his opponents or what the opinion of others might be. In politics he was a republican to the fullest extent.<BR>

To prove they love.<P>

Now thou art gone, we contend<BR>
To let our haughty natures bend,<BR>
And look above;<BR>
And fancy, from yon starlight sphere,<BR>
Your mother's nature lingers here,<BR>
To guard and love.<P>

Yes, thou art gone; but yet we find<BR>
Our mother's councils, firm but kind,<BR>
Has to us proved,<BR>
That naught that man has ever spanned<BR>
Can comprehend, and much less span,<BR>
A mother's love.<BR>

<B>CHARLES E FULLER</B><BR>Having come to the county in his infancy with his parents, thereafter passing the whole of his subsequent life within its limits, a period of more than three-score years, Charles E FULLER, of North Adams township, one of the most highly respected pioneer farmers of this portion of the state, has seen the whole of the transformation which has taken place in this region as it came forth at the command of man's sovereign will from a condition of wilderness and barbarism to one of com??ness and systematic productiveness, and he has aided materially in bringing about the change. He saw almost the beginning of its civilization and he has lived in vigor and cheerfulness to see its large and bountiful fruition. He is a native of Onondaga county, New York, born on August 8, 1834, the son of Reuben J. and Sarah A. (Allen) FULLER, the former a native of New York and the latter of Massachusetts.<P>Reuben J. FULLER was engaged in agricultural pursuits in New York until 1836, when he came by team to this state through Canada to Detroit and from there to Hillsdale county. He purchased a tract of forty acres of land southeast of North Adams from the government and, although it was the dead of winter, he began at once to build a log house for his family and made preparations to clear up the land for cultivation. He afterward purchased forty acres additional and on this farm he passed the rest of his days, excepting seven years which he spent in Kalamazoo county, dying here in 1894. His wife preceded him to the grave by nearly twenty-five years, passing away in 1871. Their family consisted of four sons and one daughter, all now living and residents of Michigan. The father contracted a second marriage, his choice on this occasion being Mrs. Axie Locklin, who died in 1896. He was an Abolitionist in politics and assisted in the operation of the underground railway before the Civil War, in wich two of his sons gave gallant service as soldiers. After the formation of the Republican party, he became an enthusiastic member of that organization, remaining in it until his death. He was prominent in local politics and filled many township positions with credit. He and his family were members of the Methodist Episcopal church. His father was Reuben FULLER who came to Michigan about 1837 and also settled in Adams township where he spent the rest of his life.<P>Charles E. FULLER was reared and educated in this county and remained at home until he was of age. In 1861 he purchased eighty acres of land, all wild and most of it heavily wooded, and began to clear it up for a home. He has resided on this land ever since and has made ot it one of the choice homes of Adams township. In 1856 he married in this county Miss Phebe E. BURGER, a daughter of Benanciel and Almyra BURGER, early settlers in this part of the state, and they have had five children, Mary A., wife of J. T. WINCH, of New York; W. Eugene and Charles H., residents of this county; Helen G., living at the paternal home; Edwin S., a prosperous business man of Toledo, Ohio. Their mother died in 1897. Mr. FULLER has been a lifelong Republican in politics, but has never held office, except that of justice of the peace, which he filled for four years. he and his family are active members of the Baptist church and he was for one year clerk of the organization. His long life of usefulness and uprightness has won him the esteem of the whole community, giving him a position in public estimation as one of the representative men of the county.
