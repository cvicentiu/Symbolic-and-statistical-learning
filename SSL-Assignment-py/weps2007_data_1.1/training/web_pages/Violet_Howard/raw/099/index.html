Both died in area hospitals.<P>For many victims, the twisters carried away nearly all of their vital papers: birth certificates, driver&#146;s licenses, titles to homes and other documents.<P>In Midwest City, residents who ask for duplicate documents but have no ID are given a pop quiz to prove they were homeowners. Police records specialist Hazel Hamer takes out a map and asks them to point to where their houses once stood.<P>&#145;&#145;We realize some people have lost everything,&#146;&#146; Hamer said. &#145;&#145;We just go by the map and we check the utility records to make sure the name and address on the bills match the addresses people are giving us.&#146;&#146;<P>Larry Williamson of the state Department of Public Safety has processed applications for more than 100 driver&#146;s licenses over several days at the Moore church.<P>People have been offering everything from fishing licenses to American Association of Retired Persons membership cards to prove their identity.<P>&#145;&#145;I took a guy awhile ago who had his entire criminal booking record with his name and address on it,&#146;&#146; Williamson said. &#145;&#145;He got his license.&#146;&#146;<P>To guard against fraud, Williamson calls up driving histories and quizzes applicants about speeding tickets, maiden names or how long they have been driving.<P>Everyone is asked to give a thumbprint, which scares away criminals and gives state investigators some key evidence if the license is used to commit fraud, Williamson said.<P>&#145;&#145;We have had some people come into the exam stations who change their stories or don&#146;t know all the answers,&#146;&#146; he said. &#145;&#145;They leave pretty quickly.&#146;&#146;<P>Melissa Hess, 24, hid in a cellar while the twisters destroyed her two-story Moore home. When she emerged, everything was gone, including the file box where she kept all her bank records and her two son&#146;s birth certificates.<P>&#145;&#145;I don&#146;t have my identification, I don&#146;t have my checkbook, I don&#146;t have my credit card,&#146;&#146; Mrs. Hess said. &#145;&#145;The only thing left at my house is the grill.&#146;&#146;<HR NOSHADE><BR><H3><a name="Blackwell, Peckham OK Bonds">Blackwell, Peckham OK Bonds</a></H3><P>Voters in both the Blackwell and Peckham School Districts approved more money Tuesday to upgrade their school systems.<P>Blackwell voters overwhelmingly passed general obligation bonds totaling $400,000 to buy school buses and band uniforms, and to provide a cooling tower for the high school and restrooms and a concession stand at the school softball field.<P>Proposition 1, which sought $100,000 for the school construction, passed by a vote of 580 to 156.

Still in Running For Future Project">P.C. Still in Running For Future Project</a></H3><P>By LOUISE ABERCROMBIE<P>News Business Editor<P>Oklahoma and Ponca City in particular remains in the running for a multi-million dollar carbon fiber plant that could be developed in the future by Conoco. This was reported at the Economic Development Advisory Board (EDAB) meeting by Carl Renfro, chairman of the New Industries Committee.<P>According to Renfro, Oklahoma is among five states competing for the project and Ponca City would be the natural location in the state. According to Jan Jarrett, EDAB executive, Oklahoma&#146;s financial package for the project is the best of the five states. Renfro said he felt positive about the project.<P>On another matter involving new industry, Renfro asked that action be delayed on the spec building until the Oklahoma Legislature votes on the capital bond improvement legislation. After this vote EDAB will find out if there is some funding available for the building.<P>Marketing Trips Slated<P>Renfro told about the effort to market the Conoco research space and told that all major universities had been to visit as well as other entities that have been brought in by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.<P>A delegation from Ponca City will be going to Oak Ridge, Tenn., to see the research set-up there and learn if there are any possibilities to locate the same type of operation here. Oak Ridge does a number of projects for the U.S. government. He had been put in touch with this group by Dr. Guven Yaecintas, the director of technology at OSU.<P>Renfro also mentioned working with personnel from the newly created Oklahoma Technology Commercialization Center. The key role of this agency is to take technology developed in Oklahoma and get it to private enterprise.<P>Renfro announced plans for a local group to go to Washington, D.C., to call on Sen. Don Nickles, Sen. Jim Inhofe and Rep. Ernest Istook to ask for some assistance on locating industry here and taking advantage of the available space offered to the community for economic development.<P>Another possibility and probably &#147;pie in the sky&#148; according to Renfro is the location of the state&#146;s training facility for CLEET, which would involve a $25 million capital investment.<P>He said this would also require passage of a bond issue by the legislature. Renfro said the site location group for the project has visited Ponca City and thought there was some potential. Ken Parr, Lee Evans and Clayton Johnson have been appointed to a committee to work on this project.<P>U.S. 177<P>Jarrett announced that it appeared that the right-of-way issue on U.S. 177 South is about to be resolved. A hearing is slated for early June and at that time it is expected that the three miles of right-of-way on the unfinished stretch of 177 near the Ponca Indian Reservation will be approved to be acquired by the ODOT.<P>Jarrett noted that Neal McCaleb, Secretary of Transportation, said the money has been set aside for the project and as soon as the right-of-way project is resolved the Department of Transportation is ready to finish the Super 2 highway between Ponca City and Stillwater.<P>Linda Brown, EDAB chairman, called for reports by Larry Buck on housing; George Paczkowski, Local Industry Council;  Art Miers, on transportation, and Jarrett, for Workforce Development. Jarrett is working for a marriage of Enid, Stillwater and Ponca City for this project. He also reported that three local industries are planning expansions, which could add 70 to 90 employees.<P>During Jarrett&#146;s report he told about receiving more and more inquiries about purchasing land in north Ponca City for commercial use. He said these &#147;big box businesses&#148; would enhance Ponca City as a regional shopping area. He said Ponca City needed to have a better mix of retailers. Jarrett noted that businesses such as Lowe&#146;s draw a lot of regional business.<P>Gerald Hall, Regional representative for the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, announced a joint meeting of the Oklahoma and Kansas Departments of Commerce set for Friday in Blackwell.<HR NOSHADE><BR><H3><a name="Edwin Fair Sets Exciting Event On Lawn May 21">Edwin Fair Sets Exciting Event On Lawn May 21</a></H3><P>It&#146;s an interesting time at Edwin Fair Community Mental Health Center, and the excitement is growing daily as they prepare for May Fest.<P>The event will be held on Friday, May 21, from 3 to 7 p.m. on the lawn of the Center at 1500 North Sixth in Ponca City.

Ponca City had one of the youngest teams at the state tournament Monday and Tuesday and returns all but one member of that team.<P>&#147;If the kids work hard this summer, we can be a petty good team &#151; maybe top five &#151; next year,&#148; McGregor said.<P>The Wildcats showed very good balance in the tournament. Freshman Matt Ellis, who shot an 80 in the drizzling rain during Tuesday&#146;s final round, finished with a 54-hole total of 246. Senior Aaron Hill came in at 247, junior Matt Waddell 248 and sophomore Nathan Coats 249. Sophomore Louie Girardi, who struggled through the first two rounds, regained his eye to help Tuesday&#146;s scoring with an 81 to finish at 261.<P>The Wildcats shot 325 on the final 18 holes to finish at 986.<P>That was far behind Jenks, who wound up with a 919 total. But no one else was close either. Jenks finished a state-record 39 strokes in front of second place Owasso (958).<P>The Trojans had four golfers among the top 10 players.<P>But all four of those players are seniors. Like most of the top teams in the state tournament, Jenks is senior dominated.<P>&#147;Most of the time Jenks just reloads,&#148; McGregor warned. But this time he may have spotted a weakness in the Trojans.<P>&#147;Their fifth man didn&#146;t help them all year. That may mean they don&#146;t have the kind of depth they have had in the past. Or it may just mean they have some good young kid they didn&#146;t play.&#148;<P>But the bottom line is that McGregor feels the Cats have a chance to vie for the state title next year.<P>&#147;And finishing 10th out of 32 teams is pretty good,&#148; he notes.<P>Team Scores<P>Jenks 919, Owasso 958, Norman 959, Putnam City North 965, Edmond North 968, Bartlesville 970.

A crowd of 10,172 showed up and at least $55,000 was raised, including ticket sales and a number of other stadium fund-raisers and concessions.<P>Oklahoma used five OSU errors to score six unearned runs and win, 10-9.<P>&#145;&#145;That&#146;s one of the best feelings in my life, and I&#146;m a horrible loser,&#146;&#146; Oklahoma State coach Tom Holliday said. &#145;&#145;We accomplished a lot tonight.&#146;&#146;<P>Tommy Whiteman hit a grand slam and Oklahoma held on after building a 7-0 lead.<P>Whiteman&#146;s homer came in the first inning off David Rollandini, who was pulled after giving up a leadoff double in the second. The Sooners (28-25) took advantage of three errors to score three times in the second.<P>Oklahoma State (37-14) got three runs in the bottom of the second, two of them on a triple by Carlos Gautreaux, and moved within 7-5 with two more in the third.<P>The Cowboys added single runs in the fourth and sixth to tie the score before Oklahoma took the lead for good with three unearned runs in the seventh.<P>Lamont Matthews&#146; 21st homer, a two-run shot in the seventh, got OSU within 10-9 but that finished the scoring.<P>&#145;&#145;We did what we wanted to accomplish, we raised money for the victims of the tornadoes,&#146;&#146; OU coach Larry Cochell said. &#145;&#145;That&#146;s the big thing.<P>&#145;&#145;The second thing, we won a ball game against a ranked team. Oklahoma State has been playing good baseball lately, and although they didn&#146;t play great defense tonight, we can use a game like this for our confidence.&#146;&#146;<P>Oklahoma trails eighth-place Kansas State by a half-game in the race for the final berth into the Big 12 Tournament, with three games remaining at home against top-ranked Texas A&amp;M this weekend.<P>Rocky Cherry (5-2) got the victory, pitching three innings of relief. Evan Greusel worked the final three innings for his first save. The loser was Ryan Herrmann (3-3), the third OSU pitcher.<P>Bobby Walters had three of Oklahoma&#146;s 12 hits. Whiteman, Casey Bookout and Sean Murphy had two each. Kevin Lucas had three hits for Oklahoma State.<P>OSU is in fourth place in the league standings heading to Texas Tech, where a three-game sweep would move them into a third-place finish.<P>&#145;&#145;Friday night for us is critical,&#146;&#146; Holliday said. &#145;&#145;Tonight was critical for thousands of people who need help. Hopefully, the money will hit some pockets and make a difference.&#146;&#146;<P><hr NOSHADE><div align="center">Copyright&copy; Ponca City News, 1998</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
