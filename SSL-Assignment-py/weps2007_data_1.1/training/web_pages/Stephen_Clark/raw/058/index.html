                        Session beginning 7 June 2004

<center><b>
           New Case of Conduct - Professor David Patrick Southall
</b></center>
<p>
"Professor Southall:
</p><p>
In November 1999 Sally Clark was convicted of the murder of her two
children, Christopher and Harry Clark.  On or about 27 April 2000 you
watched the "Dispatches" programme about the Sally Clark case that was
broadcast on Channel 4 television that night.  As a result of information
gleaned during your watching of the programme, on the next day you
contacted the Child Protection Unit of the Staffordshire Police to voice
concerns about how the abuse to Christopher and Harry Clark had in fact
occurred. Following this contact, on 2 June 2000 you met
Detective Inspector Gardner of the Cheshire Constabulary, the senior
investigating officer into the deaths of Christopher and Harry Clark, and
in effect told him that, as a result of watching the programme, you
considered that Stephen Clark, Sally Clark's husband, had deliberately
suffocated his son Christopher Clark at a hotel prior to his eventual
death.  Stephen Clark was thus implicated in the deaths of both Christopher
and Harry Clark.  Based on this opinion, you raised concern about Stephen
Clark's access to, and the safety of, the Clarks' third child, Child A.
</p><p>

At time of meeting Detective Inspector Gardner, you were not connected with
the case.  You made it clear that you were acting in your capacity as a
consultant paediatrician with considerable experience of life threatening
child abuse and that you were suspended from your duties by your employers,
the North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust ("the Trust"). You knew that it
was an agreed term of the Trust's enquiries that led to your suspension
that you would not undertake any new outside child protection work without
the prior permission of the Acting Medical Director of the Trust.  Despite
this, you had not sought permission of the Acting Medical Director prior to
contacting the Child Protection Unit of the Staffordshire Police and
meeting with Detective Inspector Gardner. You relied on the contents of the
"Dispatches" television programme as the principal factual source for your
concerns. You had a theory about the case that you presented as fact as
underpinned by your own research.  The Committee found your actions in
contacting the child protection unit of the Staffordshire Police to be
precipitate and by not seeking the permission of the Acting Medical
Director of the Trust before meeting D I Gardner to be precipitate and
irresponsible.
</p><p>

On 30 August 2000 you produced a report on the Clark family at the request
of Forshaws, Solicitors.  At the time that you produced your report you did
not have any access to the case papers, including any medical records,
laboratory investigations, post-mortem records, medical reports or x-rays.
You had not interviewed either Stephen or Sally Clark.  Your report
concluded that it was extremely likely if not certain that Mr Clark had
suffocated Christopher in the hotel room.  You remained convinced that the
third child of the Clark family, Child A, was unsafe in the hands of Mr
Clark.  Your report implied that Mr Clark was responsible for the deaths of
his two eldest children Christopher and Harry.  This was based on a theory
that you had about the case that you presented as fact, as underpinned by
your own research.  Your report declared that its contents were true and
may be used in a court of law whereas it contained matters the truth of  
which you could not have known or did not know. Your report contained no
caveat to the effect that its conclusions were based upon the very limited
information about the case known to you.
</p><p>

When given the opportunity to place such a caveat in your report you
declined, by faxed email dated 11 September 2000, stating that even without
all the evidence being made available to you it was likely beyond  
reasonable doubt that Mr Clark was responsible for the deaths of his two
other children. The Committee have found your actions as described above to
be individually and collectively inappropriate, irresponsible, misleading  
and an abuse of your professional position.
</p><p>

The Committee are extremely concerned by the facts of this case. The
Committee have heard that a formal complaint was made against you in
January 1999.  The Trust placed a limitation on your work preventing you
from undertaking any category 2 work (work that is commissioned by an
external agency) pending the outcome of their investigations. You agreed to
the Trust's request. Due to the seriousness of their concerns in November 
1999 the Trust suspended you for the duration of their inquiry and you were
therefore prevented from undertaking any child protection work.
</p><p>

The Committee have heard that you had been following the Clark case with
interest as a proportion of your clinical and research work involved the
sudden and unexpected deaths of infants and on 27 April 2000 you watched  
the Channel 4 Dispatches programme which featured an interview with Steven
Clark. As a result of viewing the programme, you formed the definite view
that Mr Clark had murdered both Christopher and Harry and that accordingly
not only had the wrong person been convicted but that the life of the
remaining child (child A) was in danger by virtue of the fact that he was
being cared for by Mr Clark. You were so convinced of your opinion that you
contacted the local child protection team, and subsequently met with
Detective Inspector Gardiner, the police officer in charge of the case.
The matter was reported to Social Services and subsequently there was a   
meeting between yourself, Social Services and the Guardian of child A. This
in turn led to Social Services convening a Child Protection Planning  
meeting. The result of this meeting was that you were asked to produce a  
report and the matter was investigated further. You did produce such a
report, dated 30 August 2000, in which you concluded that Steven Clark was
responsible for the deaths of both Christopher and Harry and that the
Clark's third child was unsafe in his care.
</p><p>

The Committee are extremely concerned that you came to this view without 
ever meeting or interviewing Mr or Mrs Clark, without seeing any of the 
medical reports, post mortem reports and without knowledge of the
discussions between the experts or witnesses involved with the Sally Clark
case.  You did not put yourself in a position to give a meaningful
explanation. Your view was a theory, which was however not presented as a
theory but as a near certainty.  Your hypothesis, based on your research,
was that the nosebleed that Christopher suffered in the hotel room whilst
alone with Mr Clark was a result of an assault.  Your view is that a
bilateral nose bleed in an infant in the absence an identifiable disease or
accident, was virtually always the consequence of life threatening child  
abuse, usually an attempted smothering.  We heard from Professor David, the
GMC expert witness that in order to come to such a firm view, one must
explore all the potential causal explanations for the nose bleed and detail
this process in the findings. In your evidence you stated you did not do
this, as it was known to all the recipients of the report that you did not
have access to any other documentation.  However you have accepted that it
would have been good practice to have detailed the diagnostic process in
your report.
</p><p>

The Committee have been directed to the guidance entitled 'Expert Witnesses
in Children Act Cases' produced by Mr Justice Wall, which you have
acknowledged as good guidance.  However, it appears that you did not follow
this guidance in the circumstances of this case.  Paragraph 5.4 states that
'You should be very cautious when advising a judge that in your opinion a
particular event occurred.  You should do this only if you feel you have
all the relevant information.' You accepted the fact that you should have
made it clear in your report that you did not have access to any documents
and that the views expressed were based solely on watching the Dispatches 
programme. The guidance further states at paragraph 10.5 'What the court is
anxious to prevent is any unrecorded informal discussions between
particular experts which are either influential in, or determinative of,  
their views and to which the parties to the proceedings do not have
access.' You further conceded the fact that you should have disclosed the
involvement of Professor Roy Meadow and Professor Green who you stated
helped confirm your theory on the case. Your reason for this omission was
out of concern for them as they had given evidence at the trial of Sally
Clark.
</p><p>

As a potential Expert Witness, you had a duty to list in your report the  
limitations of either the method you used to come to your conclusion or the
results. The Committee were concerned by the fact that when given the
opportunity to add a caveat to your report to state that your views were
based solely on your viewing of the TV programme and not on any other
evidence, you refused to do so. In fact your opinion was put in more
concrete terms by using the words 'beyond all reasonable doubt'.
</p><p>

The Committee accept that as a Consultant Paediatrician you had a duty to
report any concerns that you may have regarding child safety with other
professionals, but as you were prevented from undertaking any new child   
protection work due to the suspension imposed on you, you should have
contacted Dr Chipping, Medical Director as the terms of your suspension  
required, prior to taking any action.
</p><p>

The Committee also accept that the nature of child protection is such that 
sometimes concerns are raised which prove to be unfounded.  However,
despite this, there is a duty of care to raise such concerns in order to   
ensure the protection of children.
</p><p>

Taking into account the facts found proved against you including
inappropriate and irresponsible behaviour and an abuse of your professional
position, the Committee consider your conduct amounts to a serious
departure from the standards expected from a registered medical
practitioner. The GMC's guidance Good Medical Practice (July 1998) states
that 'Good clinical care must include an adequate assessment of the
patient's condition, based on the history, and clinical signs and if
necessary an appropriate examination'.  In providing care you must
'recognise and work within the limits of your professional competence', 'be
competent when making diagnoses and when giving or arranging treatment.'   
You did not adhere to this guidance when you involved yourself in this   
case.  You must also 'respond constructively to assessments and appraisals
of your professional competence and performance'.  GMP further states under
the heading 'If things go wrong' that 'If a patient under your care has
suffered serious harm, you should act immediately to put things right.    
When appropriate you should offer an apology'. GMP further states that
'Registered medical practitioners have the authority to sign a variety of
documents, on the assumption that they will only sign statements they     
believe to be true.  This means that you must take reasonable steps to
verify any statement before you sign a document'.  The Committee do not  
believe that you did take reasonable steps before you signed the report on
the Clark case.  Your failure to adhere to these principles resulted in  
substantial stress to Mr Clark and his family at a time when they were most
vulnerable and could have resulted in Child A being taken back into care
unnecessarily and Mr Clark's prosecution as a result of your false
allegation.  The committee are concerned that at no time during these
proceedings have you seen fit to withdraw these allegations or to offer any
apology.
</p><p>

Taking all these matters into account, the Committee find you guilty of 
serious professional misconduct.
</p><p>

In considering whether to take action in relation to your registration, the
Committee have considered the issue of proportionality and have balanced 
the interests of the public against your own. The Committee have given 
careful consideration to the submissions made on your behalf and on behalf
of the GMC and Mr Clark.  It has also considered carefully the GMC's 
Indicative Sanctions Document.  The Committee have been extremely impressed
by the vast number of and the quality of testimonials that have been put
before them.  It is clear from the testimonials that you are held in the
highest esteem by your professional colleagues both in the United Kingdom
and internationally. They all testify to your outstanding clinical skills  
and unparalleled commitment to the welfare of children all over the world.
In particular we have noted the comments of Professor Sir Alan Craft,      
President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) who
states that there has been no doubt that you have been an academic leader
and that you have undertaken extremely important ground breaking research
which 'has greatly influenced the way that babies and children have been
managed all over the world.'   The testimonials dealt with not only your   
research work, but also your work in paediatrics and child protection.
There are many references to your unstinting involvement in the care of
seriously ill children both within your own Trust and wider afield. Your 
colleagues have testified of your willingness to help them when faced with
difficult cases no matter the personal cost to yourself.  The Committee
have also heard and have been impressed by the fact that you set up Child
Advocacy International, a charitable organization which helps and promotes 
the welfare of sick children in less privileged parts of the world.  The   
Committee notes that prior to this hearing you have more than 30 years of
unblemished medical practice.
</p><p>

The Committee have taken into account the evidence of Dr Chipping, Medical
Director who appeared before the Committee to give an oral testimony on
your behalf. Dr Chipping stated that since your return to work in October
2001, you have only worked in the area of general paediatrics and that you
no longer involve yourself in paediatric intensive care or indeed in child
protection work.

The Committee nevertheless concluded that the findings against you reflect
a serious breach of the principles of Good Medical Practice and the
standards of conduct, which the public are entitled to expect from
registered medical practitioners and the Committee therefore feel obliged
to take action in the public interest. In reaching this conclusion the
Committee have borne in mind the Privy Council judgement in the case of Dr 
Gupta (Privy Council Appeal No. 44 of 2001) which states that:
</p><p>
<em>
      "The reputation of the profession is more important than the fortunes
of any individual member. Membership of a profession brings many benefits,
but that is part of the price."
</em>
</p><p>

In considering what action to take against your registration, the Committee
recognise that taking no action and concluding this case with a reprimand
would be wholly inappropriate.
</p><p>

In the circumstances, the Committee have concluded that in your own and the
public interest it must take action regarding your registration.  Based on
the findings on facts in this case and your apparent lack of insight the 
Committee have decided that it would be inappropriate for you to continue  
with child protection work for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the
Committee have decided to impose the following condition on your
registration for a period of 3 years:-
</p><p>

You must not engage in any aspect of Child Protection work either within
the NHS (Category I) or outside it (Category II).
</p><p>

The effect of the foregoing direction is that unless you exercise your 
right of appeal, your registration will become subject to the specified   
condition 28 days after the date when written notice of the direction is
deemed to have been served upon you."
