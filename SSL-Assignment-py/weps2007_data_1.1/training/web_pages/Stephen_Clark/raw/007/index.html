                366 entries provide a daily dose of comfort, strength, and 
                inspiration. The perfect bedside companion to be read in the 
                morning or evening, this magnificent work is the first of its 
                kind to combine biblical passages and commentary with a dozen 
                touching, heartfelt stories. <BR>
