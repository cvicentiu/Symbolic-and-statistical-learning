<h1 class="mainHead">Clark museum exhibit reunites estranged brothers collections</h1>

<p class="byline">By Adam Gorlick, Associated Press Writer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <span
    style="white-space: nowrap;">June 7, 2006</span></p>
<p><span>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. --</span>Before the fist fight that made them stop talking to each other, there were signs of tension between Stephen and Sterling Clark.</p>
<p>The brothers -- heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune -- began establishing themselves as major art collectors in the early 1900s. But their interests were as much at odds as their personal relationship would become.</p>
<p>Stephen, a New York City businessman who commanded the family finances that were the source of the brothers' rift, gravitated toward the blunt, bold styles of artists like Cezanne, Picasso and Van Gogh.</p>
<p>His older brother Sterling lived a decidedly more carefree life in Paris, where he amassed the softer works of Renoir, Homer and Sargent.</p>
<p>While neither brother held the other's taste in high regard, some of their paintings are finally on display under the same roof.</p>
<p>With "The Clark Brothers Collect: Impressionist and Early Modern Paintings," the Clark Art Institute -- opened in 1955 by Sterling and his wife, Francine -- reunites the estranged brothers by bringing their collections together.</p>
<p>"You had two powerful personalities in a privileged family, and they couldn't have been more different," said Michael Conforti, the Clark's director.</p>
<p>The brothers, who were close in their youth, were estranged for three decades after a brawl over Stephen's refusal to transfer $20 million to Sterling's stepdaughter.</p>
<p>"What would've happened if the brothers reconciled and pulled their collections together," Conforti said. "This exhibit gives us an idea of what that would've looked like."</p>
<p>The show features 75 works collected by Stephen and Sterling Clark, several of which are paired in "face offs" -- side-by-side displays of paintings with similar themes but different approaches.</p>
<p>In perhaps the most telling face-off, a portrait of the American surgeon David Hayes Agnew hangs next to a likeness of Emile Auguste Carolus-Duran, the French painter.</p>
<p>The image of Agnew, painted by Thomas Eakins and owned by Stephen Clark, shows the doctor as a man ready to work. With a scalpel in his sturdy, wrinkled hand, he presents a rugged figure with a no-nonsense look in his eye.</p>
<p>Carolus-Duran, on the other hand, seems to invite his viewers to admire his fancy velvet jacket and ruffled shirt. His smooth hand is bejeweled with a pinky ring, and he lets a carved walking stick rest casually against his leg. The portrait, painted by Carolus-Duran's student John Singer Sargent, was owned by Sterling Clark.</p>
<p>"You have this image of the quintessential American, hardworking doctor owned by Stephen, the New York lawyer," said Richard Rand, the Clark's senior curator. "And then there's the portrait of this Parisian dandy, which is basically what Sterling Clark became."</p>
<p>One gallery is filled with Stephen's collection of paintings by Edward Hopper and Sterling's Winslow Homers.</p>
<p>The stylistic clashes of the two artists are unmistakable, as Homer's swirling coastal scenes play against Hopper's linear and angular landscapes.</p>
<p>Another room is devoted entirely to Stephen's collection, offering some bold works not typical of his brother's taste or the majority of his museum's holdings</p>
<p>"Sterling would never have bought something like this," Rand said, referring to the thick layers of reds and greens that fill Van Gogh's "The Night Cafe," with an almost dangerous tension.</p>
<p>Despite their stylistic differences even at an early age, the Clark brothers fostered a close relationship and often sought advice from each other on how to build their own collections.</p>
<p>But as their art holdings grew, so did their sibling rivalry.</p>
<p>"I think you have the same idea of most Americans, that it must cost a certain amount or it cannot be good," Sterling wrote to Stephen. "And now when I try to get you something that is really good I cannot get you to take it."</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1923, their relationship ended with the fight over Stephen's refusal to let Sterling's stepdaughter receive $20 million in a family trust fund. Sterling sued his brother in an attempt to get the money, arguing that his stepdaughter was entitled to the trust even though she was not a descendant of the Clark bloodline.</p>
<p>Stephen prevailed in the lawsuit, and the two had no contact until Stephen's son died in 1952.</p>
<p>Sterling sent his grieving brother flowers, and Stephen responded with a letter lamenting the loss of their once close relationship.</p>
<p>"All of which goes to show how transitory life is and how trivial are so many of the things we strive and struggle and fight about," Stephen wrote.</p>
<p>But they never made amends. Sterling died four years later, shortly after the Clark Art Institute opened as a showcase of his collection. Stephen, who founded the Baseball Hall of Fame museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., and loaned much of his artwork to other museums, died in 1960.</p>
<p>"Too much pride was involved in each of their personalities," Conforti said. "But in the end, they each showed that they weren't completely against the idea of getting back together. It just didn't happen."&nbsp;<img src="http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/File-Based_Image_Resource/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" alt="" /></p></div>
