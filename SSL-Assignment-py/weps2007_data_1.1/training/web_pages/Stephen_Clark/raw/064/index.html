<b>Steve Clark's Hollywood career was in westerns and his roles were generally that of a kinder, gentler person such as the heroine's father, local banker, ranch owner or lawman.&nbsp; Those portrayals were a good match for Clark who had a mild voice and screen presence.&nbsp; And the bevy of baddies seemed to always pounce on poor ol' Steve ... or kill him off early.
<br><br>
Clark was born in 1891, and his first film credit is in the early 1930s when he was over 40 years old --- what did he do prior to filmwork?
<br><br>
Les Adams has Clark identified in at least 270 sound era films, of which 9 are cliffhangers and about 250 are westerns.&nbsp; His film credits are spread over a 20 year period from the early 1930s through the early 1950s.&nbsp;  Clark did about 30 film appearances at Republic Pictures, but nearly half of those were in the Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele oaters for A. W. Hackel (Supreme Pictures) which were released by Republic soon after the studio was formed.
<br><br>
Les adds some additional info on Clark's film roles:
<br><br>
&quot;Clark was the 'brains heavy' to Jack Randall in LAND OF THE SIX GUNS and, despite his elderly statesman status and slight stature, he was a plain ol' 'dog Henchie' in several mid-30s  and early-40s westerns and a couple of  serials, some being: ALIAS JOHN LAW, WHERE TRAILS DIVIDE, COURAGE OF THE WEST, SON OF DAVY CROCKETT, THE LONE PRAIRIE, MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN, THE SPIDER'S WEB, NORTH FROM THE LONE STAR and others.&nbsp; He was a Sheriff, Marshal or Deputy on at least 35 other films, not including the Judge in MAN OF COURAGE, one of only about six non-western or serial credits of the 270 or so I have on him.&nbsp; This  is about 100 more than the IMDb has for him, and I know I don't have everything he did. &quot;
<br><br>
In June, 2000, I received an e-mail from Bob Phillips, who as a youngster, visited Steve Clark and his wife at their California home.&nbsp; Bob writes:
<br><br>
&quot;My mother and I would visit Steve and his wife (Ruth I think) at their home in the San Fernando Valley in the early 1940's.  I believe they were friends of my mother Julia Phillips (nee Julia Fuhrman).  Possibly it was Ruth who my mother had known in the past.  Their home seemed very sophisticated to me because they had a coffee table with boxes of cigarettes and candy for their guests plus copies of the Esquire magazine (considered very racy at that time).  I was only allowed the candy (I was about 10 years old at the time) but I did sneak some peaks at the Esquire when I was in the room alone.&quot;
<br><br>
In May, 2001, I received an e-mail from Dave Smith:
<br><br>
&quot;The Center for Motion Picture Studies offered me little information on Steve Clark. No clippings, no photos. However I did find an entry in the International Motion Picture Almanac for 1950-51:<br> 
Steve Clark, b. Washington, Indiana Feb. 26, 1891<br> 
Stage actor, Director, Manager 1909-1939.<br>
Since on screen in innumerable westerns.&quot;
<br><br>
And in September, 2001, both Dave Smith and Michael R. Pitts provided further information obtained from Steve Clark's Social Security application:
<br><br>
&quot;Clark was living at 1119 N. McCadden Place in Hollywood at the time he applied for a Social Security number.&nbsp; The application was dated January 20, 1937 and lists his employer as 'The Motion Picture Industry'.  His birthdate is listed as February 26, 1891, in Davis (really Daviess) County, Indiana.  Parents were Wesley Richard Clark and Nancy Eloise Cross. He is shown with his family in the 1900 Indiana Census for Daviess County, Elmore Township.  On it he is shown as Elmer S. Clark.  Since he signed his Social Security application as Stephen Clark, his full name would have been Elmer Stephen Clark.&quot;
<br><br>
You may want to go to the In Search Of ... page and check the California Death Records.&nbsp; Using the 'Elmer Stephen Clark' name, it was easy to find a record for Clark in the California Death Records database: Elmer Stephen Clark, birthdate and location of 2/26/1891 and Indiana, Mother's maiden name of Cross, passed away on 6/29/1954, and had a Social Security number of 564-16-4635.</b>
