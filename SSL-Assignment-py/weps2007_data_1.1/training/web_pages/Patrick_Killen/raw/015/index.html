    <u><p>GENERAL BUSINESS</p>
    <p>97/0909.1 Manhattan Heights Annex/ Arts Education Building</p>
    </u><p>Staff reported eight architectural firms responded to the RFQ. A Selection Panel
    has been created. Staff members include Richard Gill, Neil Miller, Richard Thompson,
    Howard Spector and Barbara Johnson. Cultural Arts Commissioner Dale Robinson is also a
    member of this Panel. Mr. Spector stated another Staff member from the City&#146;s
    Engineering Department will be added shortly to this Panel. Staff stated the Selection
    Panel would narrow down the eight architectural firms to three finalists, interview them
    and recommend one firm to the City Council for award of contract.</p>
    <u><p>97/1111.1 &#150; Art in Public Places for 97-98</p>
    </u><p>Staff stated that one artist out of the three presenting would be recommended to
    Council, but all three proposals would be presented to Council at their October 20<sup>th</sup>
    meeting. The first artist to make their presentation was Adam Leventhal, please see the
    attached description. See the 3-D model for details. </p>
    <p>The second artist to make his presentation was Dayton Claudio, please see the attached
    materials list. Mr. Claudio stated City Hall&#146;s northeast entrance was the intended
    site for his piece. The piece consists of concrete tiles encircling the inner curve of the
    round sitting area near the entrance. Another large tiled area above the northeast
    doorway, consisting of several small tiles similar in theme to the other area would be
    installed. The intended theme would center on the ocean and beach. The imagery would be
    representative of abstracted ocean motifs. The texture and colors would also be suggestive
    of both ocean and beach. The surface of the tiles would have an anti-graffiti sealer
    applied for easier maintenance. See the 3-D model for details. </p>
    <p>The third artist, Rod Baer did not attend the meeting. All Commissioners agreed to
    disqualify Mr. Baer because of his unexcused absence. No alternative artists were part of
    the selection process.</p>
    <p>After the artists made their presentations, the Commission&#146;s discussed the
    following:</p>
    <p>Commissioner Robinson stated that the Veterans Parkway would be the best location for
    the <b>Rail Bender</b> piece, as it was a strong community piece and deserved a prominent
    spot. Commissioner Ward stated he felt the <b>Rail Bender</b> piece was the strongest of
    both presented. He did not like the texture and materials of Mr. Claudio&#146;s piece.
    Commissioner Ward stated the Polliwog Park location would be most suitable for the <b>Rail
    Bender</b> piece, as the space is very public and prominent. Commissioner Robinson
    concurred, and added the placement of the artwork would be directly across the street from
    the intended Arts Education Building. Commissioner Flad and Carmon stated they supported
    the <b>Rail Bender</b> piece. Commissioner Killen stated by far, the most playful and
    artistically sophisticated work presented was Adam Leventhal&#146;s <b>Rail Bender</b>. He
    added Polliwog Park would be a good location for the piece however felt the Veterans
    Parkway location would be an excellent &quot;happened upon&quot; and deserving location
    for this piece. He added, the Veterans Parkway location was also a very publicly
    accessible location, and was historically more appropriate for this artwork. Commissioner
    Robinson stated he agreed with Commissioner Killen on this point. Commissioner Killen
    stated the tile piece was not as strong and was representative of a &quot;standard&quot;
    type of public art piece. He felt <b>Rail Bender </b>was more representative of the
    community and history of the area. </p>
    <p>A motion was made to recommend to City Council to accept Adam Leventhal&#146;s public
    artwork <b>Rail Bender</b>, to be placed either along the Veterans Parkway (Valley/Ardmore
    at 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Streets), or second location of Polliwog Park along
    Manhattan Beach Blvd., west of the Historical Society&#146;s red house.</p>
    <p>MSC: approved 5:0. Both proposals will be presented to City Council at their October 20<sup>th</sup>
    meeting.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There was no further business discussed and the meeting was adjourned at 7:30 pm. to
    the next meeting scheduled for November 10, 1998.</p>
