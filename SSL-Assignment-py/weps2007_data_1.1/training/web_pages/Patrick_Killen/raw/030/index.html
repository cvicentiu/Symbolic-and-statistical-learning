  <u><p>GENERAL BUSINESS</p>
  <p>End of Cultural Arts Commission Terms</p>
  </u><p>Mr. Spector presented Commissioner Johnson with a certificate of Accommodation from
  the City Council for her service as a Cultural Arts Commissioner. Mr. Spector also
  personally thanked her for her lending her wisdom, advice, experience and knowledge to the
  Commission. Commissioner Goldstein was not present to accept her certificate. Cultural
  Arts Division staff mailed the certificate to her.</p>
  <u><p>New Cultural Arts Commission (CAC) Commissioners</p>
  </u><p>Mr. Spector announced new CAC Commissioners Delpha Flad and Kendra Carmon would
  attend the June 9<sup>th</sup> CAC meeting. He also added, Commissioner Robinson has been
  re-appointed for another term.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <u><p>Next CAC Regular Session to be Held at the Manhattan Heights Annex</p>
  </u><p>Mr. Spector stated that at the request of Parks and Recreation Director Richard
  Gill, the next CAC meeting will be held at the Manhattan Heights Annex, as future plans
  for the site will be discussed.</p>
  <p>9<u>7/1111.2 - Art in Public Places for 97-98:</p>
  </u><p>Mr. Spector reported that a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a public art
  commission for FY 97-98 has been drafted. He felt Council would like three sites to be
  chosen by the CAC and approved by the City Council prior to soliciting artwork from
  artists. The sites would then appear on the RFQ. Mr. Spector stated that originally the
  CAC had approved a motion to the City Council for the artists to pick three possible sites
  for their proposed artwork. </p>
  <p>During a discussion among the Commissioners, the following points were made:<ol>
    <li>Commissioner Robinson felt some artistic value would be possibly lost, if the artists</li>
  </ol>
  <p>can not choose the sites, specific to their work. Mr. Spector replied, that the RFQ
  would then be &quot;site specific&quot;, a condition artists are familiar working with, as
  all RFQs for public art commissions by public or private agencies are either &quot;site
  specific&quot; or &quot;non-site specific&quot;. He added Council&#146;s decision would
  not effect the artists&#146; artistic values.</p>
  <p>2) Commissioner Ward stated if sites were pre-determined, it would give all artists an
  &quot;equal playing field&quot;.<ol START="3">
    <li>Mr. Spector stated the artist selection process would be the following:</li>

          <p><font FACE="Monotype Sorts">F</font> A panel would select from artists&#146; requested

          <p><font FACE="Monotype Sorts">F</font> The three selected artists would investigate the
          three pre-determined sites.</p>
          <p><font FACE="Monotype Sorts">F</font> The artists would make presentations to the CAC
          and panel.</p>
          <p><font FACE="Monotype Sorts">F</font> The CAC and panel would chose an artist and
          project based on the artists&#146; presentations.</p>
          <p><font FACE="Monotype Sorts">F</font> The CAC would make a recommendation to the City

  <p>Rosecrans and Aviation (by studios)</p>
  <i><p>Parks: Other:</p>
  </i><p>Parque Culican Veterans Pathway</p>
  <p>Polliwog Park (Southeast corner) Water Tower site</p>
  <p>Marine Ave. Park</p>
  <p>5) Commissioner Killen recommended the east public entrance of City Hall, as there is
  already an art piece at the west entrance, by personnel. He felt many people use the east
  entrance more than the west, as parking is along that side of the building. He added,
  Parque Culican would also be a very good site for a public art piece to be located, as it
  is a visible and accessible location for the public. He stated it would be a good site to
  &quot;bring the community together&quot;.</p>
  <p>6) Commissioner Ward agreed with Commissioner Killen&#146;s suggestion. He asked Mr.
  Spector if the emergency call box locations along the Veterans Parkway project would be a
  good site for art placement? Mr. Spector replied by stating he felt it would not be good
  to mix projects at this point in their development.</p>
  <p>7) Commissioner Johnson suggested the corner of Manhattan Beach Blvd. and Redondo Ave.
  (Southeast corner of Polliwog Park), would be an excellent site, as it is highly
  accessible to park-goers and auto traffic. She suggested the intersection of
  Valley/Ardmore and close to 2<sup>nd</sup> Street (on grass) would be a great site also,
  as people walking, jogging or biking along the Veterans Parkway would experience it, as
  well as those driving by. It would also act as a gateway into Manhattan Beach from
  Hermosa.</p>
  <p>8) Commissioners Killen, Ward, and Robinson agreed with Commissioner Johnson.</p>
  <p>A motion was made to recommend the following sites be recommended to Council: City Hall
  (east entrance); Parque Culican; intersection of Valley/Ardmore and close to 2<sup>nd</sup>
  Street (on grass) for art placement. MSC: approved unanimously (4-0).</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>98/0512.2 &#150; Arts Festival 1998:</p>
  </u><p>Mr. Spector reported the Cultural Arts staff was gearing-up for the upcoming 1998
  Arts Festival. The Festival will take place on September 13<sup>th </sup>, and will
  probably take place on Manhattan Ave. . He stated it would be similar to last year&#146;s
  festival, however this year there will be no large bands involved. Funds that were
  formerly utilized for contracting the larger bands would be used to offer more
  participatory art related activities.</p>
  <u><p>Other Business: </p>
  </u><p>Commissioner Killen announced he will be submitting a plan for the development of
  the Metlox site, the deadline is Friday, May 15<sup>th</sup>. He added there might be a
  conflict of interest if his plan were accepted, but felt able to resolve the situation if
  necessary. </p>
  <p>There was no further business discussed and the meeting was adjourned at 7:25pm. to the
  next meeting scheduled for June 9, 1998.</p>
