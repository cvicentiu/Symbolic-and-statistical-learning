No. 5, to read as follows:<br>
<br>

and responsible.<br>
<br>

DISCUSSION<br>
<br>
SEAT NO. 5 QUALIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
At the Adjourned Regular Meeting held on Tuesday, October 10, 1995,<br>
the City Council declared vacant Seat No. 5 on the Cultural Arts<br>
Commission due to the relocation of Commissioner Grossman. In the<br>
report to Council it was indicated that in accordance with Council<br>
Resolution No. 4710, one of the qualifications for this office is<br>
that the commissioner be a board member of the Manhattan Beach<br>
Friends of the Arts. Subsequent to that action being taken by<br>
Council, and upon further review of the files, staff discovered<br>
that on June 5, 1990 the Council unanimously approved the deletion<br>
of this requirement and requested that the Manhattan Beach Friends<br>
of the Arts nominate someone to fill this seat. At that time it<br>
appears that staff failed to amend the resolution accordingly,<br>
therefore I am requesting that the language of the resolution be<br>
modified to reflect that change at this time.<br>
<br>
Due to the statutory requirements for the posting of unscheduled<br>
vacancies, the appointment to fill Seat No. 5 cannot be made until<br>
Tuesday, November 7, 1995. The adoption of this resolution tonight<br>
allows staff time to contact the Manhattan Beach Friends of the<br>
Arts and request that they submit a nominee to be ratified by the<br>
Council on November 7, 1995.<br>
<br>
CORRECTION OF ASSIGNMENT OF SEATS 2 AND 3<br>
<br>
Upon reviewing the files for the Cultural Arts Commission, it came<br>
to my attention that the assignments for Seats No. 2 and 3 have<br>
been inadvertently switched. Patrick Killen is currently listed as<br>
serving in Seat No. 2 (At-Large), however he should be serving in<br>
Seat No. 3 (Business and Development Representative). When this<br>
appointment was made it was Council's intent that Mr. Killen serve<br>
in Seat No. 3 since this seat does not require that the<br>
commissioner be an elector of the City. Mr. Killen is a Hermosa<br>
Beach resident and a business owner at 912 Manhattan Avenue in<br>
Manhattan Beach. Homeira Goldstein is currently listed as serving<br>
in Seat No. 3 (Business and Development Representative), however<br>
she should be serving in Seat No. 2 (At-Large).<br>
<br>
The commissioners will retain their current term schedules and this<br>
correction will have no affect on their maximum tenure. The<br>
correction is actually ministerial in nature and does not require<br>
Council approval, however since the resolution does require Council<br>
approval, I felt that it was appropriate to make all of the<br>
adjustments at the same time in order to correct the record.<br>
<br>
ALTERNATIVES<br>
<br>
1) That the Council adopt the resolution modifying the<br>
qualifications for Seat No. 5 as recommended and approve<br>
staff's recommendation to correct the assignments for Seat No.<br>
2 and 3.<br>
<br>
2) That the Council adopt a modified version of the resolution to<br>
request that the Manhattan Beach Friends of the Arts nominate<br>
and submit a maximum of three (3) names for consideration by<br>
The Council for Seat No. 5, and approve staff's recommendation<br>
to correct the assignments for Seats No. 2 and 3.<br>
<br>
3) That the Council discuss and provide direction to staff.<br>
