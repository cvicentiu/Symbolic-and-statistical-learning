<h2>Amazon Interviews Ellis</h2>
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/571852/002-9491117-4684021">Amazon interview with Bret Easton Ellis</a> is now up.

<blockquote><b>Amazon.com:</b> Finally, is it true that you're going to revisit the characters from Less Than Zero in your next book?
<br><br>
<b>Ellis:</b> It depends on how many people shoot down this idea. Since I've been living out here in LA for the last year and a half, I've wanted to write a book that's set here. I want to come back to LA. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about where those people are now and it is what is formulating. But I haven't fully figured it out.</blockquote>

So here's your chance.  Tell Bret its a great idea to revisit Less Than Zero, or tell him its horrible ... he's listening.

I would love to revisit the same characters and see what they're up to, twenty-years later. (Blair is now a Soccer Mom/MILF, addicted to valium.) The problem Bret will face is everyone will compare the book to the original, and there's no way a new book could stand next to twenty-years of classic-building. As long as he's ok with so-so reviews, I'm ok with loving the book.</p>

Mr. Ellis can do whatever he wants to do, and he will do it well. That stated, I imagine he might take the approach used by his colleague and friend, Jay McInerney. His debut novel, "Bright Lights, Big City" was followed a few books later by the much denser and intricately plotted novel, "Brightness Falls".</p>

<p>"Less Than Zero" was published 20 years ago, in 1985, the same year I myself started at university. Back then, college students still discussed contemporary novels the way they fawn over the antics of Paris Hilton, Inc. today. I am so pleased and proud that my young assessment of Mr. Ellis was correct. His novels are built to last, and "Lunar Park" appears to be yet another on its way into the canon of Literature with a capital L. If he does pen a "More Than Zero" next, I am sure it will win.<br />

Of course, I don't think Hollywood gave it the justice it deserved and I'd like to see Bret's take on "where they are now."  I just finished the advance reader's edition of "Lunar Park" and it's simply amazing.  My biggest wish, regardless of what he writes in the future, is that Bret becomes more prolific in his writing!  I could hardly wait any longer for "Lunar Park," but it was admittedly worth it.</p>

However, I would prefer a sequel to "American Psycho" any day.  I still have the emails Patrick Bateman sent as a promo for the movie (which I've read more than once, wondering which if any ideas originate from Ellis).  I would like to know what Patrick Bateman is doing (I'm certain I'm not alone).  Bateman can be the new 007 or more appropriately, Tom Ripley.  He should have adventures in Europe and Asia and shit.  </p>

So this will probably be a novel where he catches back up with some of his older characters, maybe adding some new ones too, who knows. I'm sure it won't be a flat out sequel, that's not Ellis's style.</p>
