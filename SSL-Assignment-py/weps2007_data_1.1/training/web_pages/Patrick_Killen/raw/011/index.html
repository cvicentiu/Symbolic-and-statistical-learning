Legalize Marijuana?</div>

<div class="main_post">
<p>Question 7 on the November ballot goes <a href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/home/06init">thusly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>AN ACT relating to marijuana; providing that a person who is 21 years of age or older is exempt from arrest, civil or criminal penalty, seizure or forfeiture of assets, discipline by any state or local licensing board and state prosecution for the possession, use and transfer of one ounce or less of marijuana and the use and possession of marijuana paraphernalia under certain circumstances...</blockquote>

<p>In libertarian-minded Nevada, this measure would seem to have a good chance at passage.  It certainly would make no sense to send someone to jail for having an ounce of less of marijuana on them - and since we wouldn't rationally send a person to jail on that, why make it illegal at all?  Additionally, it is well within the American tradition to not interefere unduly in the life choices of others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is this worry:  We've strayed so far down the road to permissiveness that we've actually become rather licentious as a nation.  Do we really want to add fuel to the hedonistic fire by legalising marijuana?  There is also this:  what is to prevent a dealer from keeping only an ounce at a time on himself?  It would be rather easy to stash a pound close by and just continually re-fill the pocket as ounce after ounce is sold to whomever asks - including minors.</p>

<p>As of right now, I'd have to say that I'm undecided on this issue.  I did vote to legalise medicinal marijuana, but I'm not sure that now is the right time to legalise non-medicinal possession.</p>

<p>As a matter of clarification, as I read the initiative, Question 7 doesn't "leagalize" marijuana. It does, however, remove the exisiting penalties for possession and use for adults in the privacy of their own homes. It also increases penalties on those who would sell to our children or any minor. This initiative is not a matter of hedonism or permissiveness, It's a matter of common sense in dealing with a law that doesn't work. Prohibition has never been the answer .. not back in the "Capone days" and not now. </p>

<p>In my way of thinking (and I am a conservative) a vote against this Question is tantamount to a continued endorsement of the "street dealer". Booze is controlled and regulated (and heavily taxed to boot) and you don't see "booze dealers" selling out of the back of their Buick.</p>

<p>Just makes good sense to me .. control.. regulate .. tax .. and get it off the street.</p>

<p>You want those Medical marijuana patients to have a safe place to get their meds? A yes vote on Question 7 does the trick. Just one mans opinion.</p>

<div id="c2">
<p>Thank you for discussing our initiative on your blog!  I just wanted to take a moment to address your concerns.</p>

<p>Our initiative recognizes that Nevada's marijuana laws do not work, and it's time to adopt a new strategy.  Despite over 10,000 marijuana arrests in Nevada during the last three years alone, marijuana remains widely available and easy to get. The criminal marijuana market is a "free-for-all" controlled by violent gangs and drug dealers, with no oversight or safeguards to speak of.</p>

<p>In contrast, we support the taxation and regulation of marijuana sales. Marijuana will continue to be widely available – whether permitted or not – so a sensible alternative is to place it into a tightly controlled and regulated market. Once we regulate the marijuana market, we create the opportunity to tax it and establish safeguards that are currently non-existent.</p>

<p>You raise concerns about "dealers," but under Question 7, the only entities allowed to sell marijuana will be retailers licensed by the Nevada Department of Taxation. Licensed retailers would have to buy their marijuana from state-licensed manufacturers.  Only adults over the age of 21 will be allowed to purchase up to one ounce of marijuana from state-licensed retailers; if an individual possesses over an ounce of marijuana at any given time, they'll be breaking the law and subject to the state's existing penalties in this area.</p>

<p>Regarding sales to minors, Question 7 establishes a “We Card” program for marijuana. If you aren’t 21 or older, or do not have proper ID, you won’t be allowed to enter an establishment that sells marijuana – much less buy it. Marijuana use by anyone younger than 21, driving under the influence of marijuana, and smoking marijuana in public would all remain illegal. In fact, the maximum penalty for any adult who gives or sells marijuana to a minor would DOUBLE, as would the maximum penalty for anyone who kills someone while driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or any drug.</p>

<p>Retailers who sell marijuana couldn’t be located within 500 feet of a school or place of worship.  No establishment that sells alcohol or allows gaming will be allowed to sell marijuana – nor would gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores, or nightclubs.  Question 7 doesn’t put marijuana in the local 7-11 – in fact, it specifically forbids it. </p>

<p>Once we regulate marijuana, we can tax it. Half of the tax revenue generated by Question 7 would go toward drug/alcohol education and treatment; the other half would go to the state's general fund, potentially generating millions of dollars for our most pressing needs – like improving education, fixing roads, and dealing with growth.<br />
 <br />
We believe that after decades of marijuana laws that don’t accomplish what they were meant to – yet cause real societal harm by financing violent gangs and drug dealers, destroying the lives of otherwise law-abiding Nevadans, and wasting precious police resources – it’s time for a new approach.</p>

<p>Voters can find out more about Question 7 at our Web site, <a href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.regulatemarijuana.org.</a>  We appreciate your consideration of the initiative!</p>

<p>Patrick,</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification - one thing:</p>

<p>Who is to be the licensed supplier?  We certainly don't want to provide a legitimate market for the criminal element that illegally transports marijuana in to the US currently.  Are we to have marijuana farms in Nevada?  How do we prevent the product of such farms from winding up in States - with my conservative bow to States' rights - which decide that marijuana should remain illegal?</p>

<p>Additionally - what is our provision for fighting off Uncle Sam on the issue?</p>

<p>Steve,</p>

<p>I'm generally with you on that - I'm rather stern in my morality, but I also know the weakness of the State in attempting to enforce on such matters...and I do believe the war on drugs has been a counter-productive failure.</p>

<p>But I do worry:  the kids these days are essentially already being pressured heavily to do things they shouldn't - would legalisation (or, if you prefer, de-criminalisation) help or hinder our efforts to instruct the kids on wise behaviour?</p>

<p>Sadly, after it passes with a 90% vote the fed will come in and remind you that you little state things are not allowed to make your own laws and you have to bow to the fed by repealing your silly little vote or giving up your highway monies for a few years. </p>

<p>We get the government we deserve, and we usually get it good and hard.</p>

<p>We, the people, have to start forcing Uncle Sam to disgorge some of the power we allowed him to take while we were out slouching around and listening to rock n roll and thinking that freedom was the ability to get laid and act like permanent children (thank you, Baby Boomers).</p>

<p>We have to start acting like adults, and takind adult responsibility for our lives and our actions.</p>

<p>Mark,</p>

<p>From my way of thinking (fiscally) the war on drugs has been a miserable failure .. Maybe it's time to bring the "troops" home and rethink the way our money (yours and my tax money) is being wasted. </p>

<p>Children, especially teens, are always going to try to push the edge of the envelope. you did, I did and everyone I ever knew did. <br />
It's the nature of the beast(s). I'm a big, big (huge) proponent of Parental responsibility. We (and I include myself) as parents, have the responsibility of teaching our children right from wrong. We do this in the best manner we know how and sounding too “preachy” doesn't usually work. We protect them as best we can and then turn them loose on the world. If we have done a good job, they have the tools they need to make wise and prudent decisions in their lives. If not, maybe we spawned another Charlie Manson. But, I digress... </p>

<p>Marijuana is an intoxicant, along with beer, wine, vodka, tequila etc. etc. ...  All those “legal” items are far more harmful to the human organism then marijuana ever was or will ever be. No one ever, in the history of the world, ever died from a marijuana overdose. While 20,000 people in the U.S. Died last year as a direct result of Alcohol use, and I'm not talking DUI's. or falls down the stairs. I have also never seen a mean “stoner”. Goofy and lethargic maybe, but never mean. I have, however, seen many mean, miserable, belligerent drunks .. all seemingly wanting to kick my ass or at least somebody's ass.</p>

<p>If we are going to lump marijuana in with some other grouping, let it be Coors not Crack. It's a much closer cousin .. although, Coors will kill you  </p>

<p>Mark:</p>

<p>The entities supplying retailers will be wholesalers that are licensed by the Nevada Department of Taxation.  Licensed wholesalers will be Nevada businesses that cultivate, prepare, package, and sell marijuana to retailers or other wholesalers, but not to the general public.  </p>

<p>Regarding your states' rights concerns, the initiative specifically prohibits the transport of marijuana outside of the State of Nevada.  As for Uncle Sam, we believe it is within Nevada’s power as a state to pass this law.  According to the FBI and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 99% of marijuana arrests occur at the state and local level -- this is clearly a state issue.  Furthermore, back when Nevada’s medical marijuana initiative was on the ballot, federal authorities threatened to shut it down if it passed.  It’s been in effect now for over five years, and the federal government's threats never materialized.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any additional questions.  Thank you!</p>

<p>While I don't want to make assumptions about the owner of this blog, from personal experience as well as my own personal conversations with educated, degree bearing professionals, the vast majority believe that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol.  In fact, quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Marijuana has been scientifically determined to have no chemical dependence (unlike alcohol), and also unlike alcohol HAS been determined to have paliative qualities.<br />
 <br />
 - It mitigates the wasting effects of chemotherapy and HIV/AIDS medication<br />
 - It has been helpful in relieving corneal pressure among glaucoma sufferers.<br />
 - It also reduces some of the tremors and spasms suffered by those afflicted by multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it has been the government's policy to treat marijuana as a dangerous narcotic, similar to cocaine, opium, and herion.  As a result, nearly 500,000 Americans are arrested every year on average, most for simple posession.  </p>

<p>In fact, since the prohibition of marijuana in the late 1930's, the US Government has not re-exmined the issue of legality on the basis on any sound science whatsoever -- merely the moral posturing of politicians who claim it is a "gateway" drug...even though most hardcore drug users also experiment with tobacco and alcohol prior to "harder" substances.</p>

<p>Given the widespread use, and the ineffective policies of the Federal government to curb its use, I personally believe the resources of our country are better spent combatting the REAL drug threats of crack, meth, heroin, and cocaine, and diverting the resources spent on Marijuana interdiction against child predators, and our global war on terror.</p>

<p>Just an opinion, but in a free and enlightened society such as ours, I think we are mature enough to explore this issue by incremental steps such as these and see what the outcome is.  We can always go back to the "old ways" if this experiment should fail.</p>

<p>Marijuana is illegal, and has been since the 1940's, and yet you can still walk into any junior high school in America and find out who to go to if you want to buy some.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to legalize it, sell it at circle K and tax the heck out of it? At least circle K cards people when they want to buy booze, they could do the same for pot.</p>

<p>I guess we'll be ok fighting Uncle Sam - though some of the revenues from sales would have to be set aside for legal work.</p>

<p>One last detail on the initiative:  the suppliers will have to pass a background check to ensure no criminal history, right?<br />

<p>Interesting handle.</p>

<p>At any rate, I think that a lot of people will agree with your basic premise...I do, but I also know there is a great deal of wariness about legalization out there.  With that in mind, the Question 7 people are going about it correctly with their logical follow-on to medicinal marijuana.</p>

<p>Mark, regarding your question, "One last detail on the initiative: the suppliers will have to pass a background check to ensure no criminal history, right?"  </p>

<p>Following the initiative's passage, the Nevada Department of Taxation will have a period of time to adopt regulations necessary for implementing the system of wholesaling and retailing.  Though not spelled out in the initiative specifically, the background check issue is likely something that would come up during that process.</p>

<p>Hi there - Personally I do not believe that weed needs to or should be used. It is possible to have a good time without it. It also lowers your socialising skills because when you are stoned you are unaware of what is happening around you and it is difficult to have a conversation with someone. <br />
I have seen it screw up many good friends. And I have seen that there are obvious effects of it being used frequently such as permanent memory damage plus others too. Furthermore weed is far worse for you than smoking as it contains 4 times the amount of tar as a cigarette. What is the point in paying for something that just messes you up and helps you to lose friends?<br />
If you are reading this please think about doing it before you do so and think about others too. <br />
Many thanks<br />
Much Love<br />

<p>Hi Matt. I hope you guys are still trying. My husband and I laughed a lot when we realized most likely the reason Question 7 didn't pass was due to the fact a bunch of stoned people don't put a lot of effort into much of anything. What you need are more people like me that no longer smoke but truely believe in what you are doing to keep their kids away from drugs. I hope you don't take offence to my humor. Unfotunatley, my husband are running our own company and I suffer from miserable headaches due to a brain tumor so we can't be your Reno spokspeople. We do make a big effort though. Good Luck in the future. Teressa </p>
