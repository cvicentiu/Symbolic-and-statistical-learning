<font color="000000">Nevada -- A debate last week on the pros and cons of decriminalizing marijuana brought out more than 50 students and community members wanting to hear more about the issue before voting in next weeks election.<p>Six panelists from the medical, political and educational communities debated Nevada ballot initiative seven, which would legalize the sale and possession of up to one ounce of marijuana for people 21 and older.</font>
<br><br><font color="000000">The University of Nevada, Reno's Center for the Application of Substance Abuse Technology, Student Organization of Providers of Addiction Services, and the Substance Abuse Treatment Program hosted the forum, which featured three panelists in support of Question 7 and three in opposition.<p>According to panelist Patrick Killen, communications director for Yes on Question 7, Nevada's marijuana laws have failed.<p>"We would suggest by taking marijuana out of the hands of violent gangs and drug dealers and taxing it and regulating it, we would have a far more suitable policy for Nevada," Killen said.<p>One of the opponents, Todd Roybuck, spent several years in the narcotics division of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.<p>Representing NevadaSaysNo.com, Roybuck said legalizing any amount of marijuana might lead to drastic social change.<p>"My biggest issue with Question 7 is that legalizing marijuana for adults tells our kids that smoking pot is just part of growing up," he said.<p>While all the panelists said the forum went very well, senior Zachary Michalka said there were times he wasn't satisfied.<p>"I honestly thought the discussion got off track too often," he said. "It was still a good discussion when it did stay on track."<p>Michalka, a general studies major, said he attended the forum because he wanted to learn more about Question 7 in order to make an informed vote.<p>Laiel Winder, president of SOPAS, said this was exactly what the forum was intended to serve.<p>"With the marijuana initiative being such a popular topic right now, we thought this would be a way for students and people of the community to learn about the different sides of the issue so they that could make an informed decision," Winder said.<p>Panelist Stephen Frye, a former UNR professor, came to the forum with a few facts for the audience.<p>"From the pharmacological effects of marijuana, there have been no recorded deaths," Frye said. "7,500 people died last year from aspirin and ibuprofen."<p>While many audience members supported Question 7, Roosevelt Blackburn Jr. said he was concerned marijuana stores would target and hurt poorer Nevada neighborhoods.<p>"It just makes property values go down even worse," he said.<p>Note: Professionals explore proposed change to state marijuana laws.<p>Source: Nevada Sagebrush (U of Nevada, in Reno, NV, Edu)<br>Author: Daniel Czech<br>Published: October 31, 2006<br>Copyright: The Nevada Sagebrush<br>Contact:  <A HREF="mailto:editor@nevadasagebrush.com">editor@nevadasagebrush.com</A><br>Website: <a href="http://www.nevadasagebrush.com">http://www.nevadasagebrush.com</a><p>Related Articles & Web Site:<p>Regulate and Control Marijuana<br><a href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/">http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/</a><p>Marijuana Proponents Light Up TV With Ads<br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22342.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22342.shtml</a><p>Mr. Walters Goes To Nevada <br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22284.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22284.shtml</a><p>Clergy Supports Effort To Legalize Marijuana<br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22235.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22235.shtml</a> </font>

Officers took the demonstrators into custody in front of a Marriott hotel on Rio San Diego Drive shortly after noon, said Steph Sherer of Americans for Safe Access, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.<p>The arrestees, who were among about 60 demonstrators taking part in the rally, refused to leave until they spoke with DEA Administrator Karen Tandy.<p>They planned to ask Tandy "where they should get their medicine, now that the agency has shut down all medical cannabis dispensaries in the area," Sherer said.<p>"When she declined, San Diego police arrested the seven for trespassing and cited one," Sherer said, adding that the eighth was a man in a wheelchair.<p>All of them are medical marijuana patients who have been prescribed the drug for various ailments, she said.<p>Those arrested were taken to SDPD Eastern Division headquarters, where they were cited and released on their own recognizance.<p>Copyright: 2006 KGTV TheSanDiegoChannel.com<p> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/kgtv/20061101/lo_kgtv/10205181">http://news.yahoo.com/s/kgtv/20061101/lo_kgtv/10205181</a>

That would be a bummer, huh? But what if it was a change for the "social" good? What, if by Legally allowing adults to use a SAFER(less harmful)recreational substance than alcohol, or other drugs, including pharma-poisons,  homicides went down? Domestic violence? Child abuse? Spousal abuse? Street crime? Traffic fatalities? Absences from work? It would be worth a chance for all that, wouldn't it? So, a drastic social change could be for the GOOD of society, yes? Instead of trying everything that hasn't worked, let's try something that WILL work. END CANNABIS PROHIBITION NOW!<p>"My biggest issue with Question 7 is that legalizing marijuana for adults tells our kids that smoking pot is just part of growing up," he said.<p>No, it would be telling our kids that smoking pot, or using cannabis in ANY way, is a FACT OF LIFE.<p>While many audience members supported Question 7, Roosevelt Blackburn Jr. said he was concerned marijuana stores would target and hurt poorer Nevada neighborhoods.<p>"It just makes property values go down even worse," he said.<p>You wouldn't won't cannabis users coming to the rich side of town to purchase their products either, would you? Isn't this a typical portrayal of what Amerisheep hold dear? PROPERTY. Nothing else. Not life, not liberty, not healing, not compassion, nothing. Just PROPERTY. Disgusting.<p>Wage peace on war. END CANNABIS PROHIBITION NOW! </font><br><br>
