					<p><b>Dear Patrick Killen:</p>
	<p> Can I count on you to stand with me in defense of<br />
 traditional marriage?</p>
	<p> I am under fierce attack from the homosexual lobby<br />
 and their &#8220;same-sex marriage&#8221; allies in the press,<br />
 and I need your prayers &#8212; and your help:</p>
	<p>https://secure.cartlight.com/merchant/keyes/donation.php?afid=conpet</p>
	<p> Let me explain what is happening.</p>
	<p> If you have been following the news lately, you may<br />
 have seen that militant homosexuals, certain pro-<br />
 homosexual media outlets and commentators, and even<br />
 a few weak-kneed Republicans (who should know better)<br />
 have been attacking me relentlessly because of some<br />
 remarks I made &#8212; and some I &#8220;reportedly&#8221; made &#8211;<br />
 during a radio interview about &#8220;homosexual marriage.&#8221;</p>
	<p> Before I go any further, let me show you the quote<br />
 that has them so enraged: &#8220;The essence of &#8230; family<br />
 life remains procreation. If we embrace homosexuality<br />
 as a proper basis for marriage, we are saying that it&#8217;s<br />
 possible to have a marriage state that in principle<br />
 excludes procreation and is based simply on the premise<br />
 of selfish hedonism.&#8221;</p>
	<p> This is what I believe. This is what you believe. And<br />
 this is what I have said for years. Our Creator designed<br />
 the Institution of Marriage to be between a man and a<br />
 woman. Nothing any human court, any legislature, or<br />
 any special interest  group can say or do will ever<br />
 change that natural reality.</p>
	<p> I make no apologies for my position &#8212; which, not<br />
 coincidentally, is the position of the Republican Party<br />
 Platform drafted by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist<br />
 and approved by President Bush &#8212; and I will not<br />
 surrender one inch of ground to those who are attacking<br />
 this sacred institution. You would expect nothing less<br />
 of me.</p>
	<p> Now, here is where the recent trouble begins.</p>
	<p> The &#8220;gay activist&#8221; interviewer followed up my answer<br />
 with a question as to whether my understanding of<br />
 homosexuality would apply to Vice-President Cheney&#8217;s<br />
 daughter. I said, mindful of her advocacy of &#8220;homosexual<br />
 marriage,&#8221; that of  course, *by definition*, it would<br />
 apply.</p>
	<p> So I did not evade the question. I answered yes, as you<br />
 would expect me to.</p>
	<p> Well, the pro-homosexual press &#8212; and some in the<br />
 political establishment &#8212; went apoplectic. And then they<br />
 went on a vindictive, deceitful attack. Let me show you<br />
 some examples.</p>
	<p> Associated Press: &#8220;Illinois Republican Senate candidate<br />
 Alan Keyes labeled homosexuality &#8217;selfish hedonism&#8217; and<br />
 said Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s lesbian daughter is<br />
 a sinner.&#8221;</p>
	<p> Los Angeles Times: &#8220;On Tuesday, Alan Keyes, the<br />
 Republican Senate candidate in Illinois, denounced gays<br />
 as &#8217;selfish hedonists.&#8217; Asked whether that applied to<br />
 Mary Cheney, Keyes replied, &#8216;That goes by definition.<br />
 Of course she is.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p> Washington Post: &#8220;Further tension erupted yesterday<br />
 when Illinois Senate candidate Alan Keyes called Mary<br />
 Cheney a &#8217;selfish hedonist.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p> Look at what I said, and then look at what they say I<br />
 said. They are lying!</p>
	<p> The essence of each of these &#8220;news reports&#8221; is false.<br />
 They have twisted my words&#8230; or even made them up&#8230; in<br />
 order to inflame those who are our political and policy<br />
 enemies, and to intimidate our allies.</p>
	<p> This is not objective reporting. This is shameless,<br />
 deceitful propaganda, with a clear political objective.</p>
	<p> I must confess, after having been in public life for over<br />
 two decades, none of this surprises me. But it does still<br />
 amaze me when dishonest members of the press corps<br />
 deliberately misquote me; it still grieves me that men<br />
 and women who should be our allies run for cover at the<br />
 first sound of hostile fire; and it distresses me that<br />
 a radical minority like the militant homosexual movement<br />
 can hold such political power over how the news is<br />
 reported, and how crucial public policy in America is<br />
 discussed.</p>
	<p> Friend, I will not surrender to this assault. I will not<br />
 be cowed, and evade direct questions that require answers<br />
 of logic and conviction. And neither should you.</p>
	<p> https://secure.cartlight.com/merchant/keyes/donation.php?afid=conpet</p>
	<p> And please make no mistake&#8230; this is an assault on all<br />
 of us who hold to deep beliefs, moral absolutes, tenents<br />
 of faith, and the rigors of sound reasoning.</p>
	<p> Let me tell you plainly what the goal is of the homosexual<br />
 lobby and its advocates in the press while they attack<br />
 me&#8230; and what is at stake in the bigger picture.</p>
	<p> First, the left-wingers are hoping to isolate me; they<br />
 have been acting for years to make homosexual behavior<br />
 &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and to viciously denounce and falsely<br />
 caricature all who stand in their way. They are now<br />
 trying to get rank-and-file Republicans and members of<br />
 the GOP establishment to walk away from my candidacy and<br />
 abandon me, because I am a man of conviction, and<br />
 because I have the courage to say what I believe.</p>
	<p> They do not want me in the Senate! The very thought of<br />
 me debating and working on the Senate floor for the<br />
 issues you and I hold dear, horrifies them!</p>
	<p>They know I can&#8217;t be bullied or bought, so they are<br />
 trying to destroy me with distortions and deceit before<br />
 I reach the Senate. And rest assured, with your help, I<br />
 can win this race!</p>
	<p> Second, the pro-homosexual Democrats in the media are<br />
 doing everything in their power to elect my opponent,<br />
 Barack Obama. As you probably know, this man is to the<br />
 left of Bill Clinton and John Kerry! He represents the<br />
 epitome of what is wrong with the direction of our nation<br />
 politically.</p>
	<p> But finally, what is perhaps the most troubling aspect<br />
 of this attack on me is how it could affect the whole<br />
 debate about &#8220;homosexual marriage.&#8221;</p>
	<p> This media-generated artificial firestorm is a part of<br />
 the homosexual movement&#8217;s desire to silence ALL dissent<br />
 against them, their behavior, and their political<br />
 objectives.</p>
	<p> If the press is successful in smearing me with lies,<br />
 fabrications and misquotes, how many other politicians<br />
 do you think will dare to speak out against the radical<br />
 homosexual agenda &#8212; and in defense of traditional<br />
 marriage?</p>
	<p> If a candidate or a member of Congress says these simple<br />
 words, &#8220;If we embrace homosexuality as a proper basis<br />
 for marriage, we are saying that it&#8217;s possible to have<br />
 a marriage state that in principle excludes procreation<br />
 and is based simply on the premise of selfish hedonism&#8230;&#8221;<br />
 and those words cause him to come under relentless attack<br />
 and ridicule, how many men and women in Congress do you<br />
 think have the courage to risk such abuse? We cannot let<br />
 this happen!</p>
	<p> We already know that many politicians are running scared<br />
 from this issue, even though they know in their hearts<br />
 that the &#8220;homosexual revolution&#8221; is rushing forward in<br />
 America, and is destructive to the fiber and health of<br />
 our families and our nation.</p>
	<p> The pro-homosexual movement wants to make an example<br />
 of me, so that political resistance to their agenda of<br />
 &#8220;homosexual marriage&#8221; collapses, and the complete<br />
 &#8220;normalization&#8221; of homosexuality triumphs! We must<br />
 stand tall against these attacks!</p>
	<p> They want a country where anyone who is seeking office<br />
 is afraid to say the TRUTH about the homosexual<br />
 lifestyle and agenda.</p>
	<p> At that point, the militant homosexuals will be able<br />
 to achieve their goals, because of the fear that grips<br />
 the hearts of those who should oppose them. Friend, we<br />
 MUST NOT let this happen.</p>
	<p> Can I count on you to help withstand this assault?</p>
	<p> https://secure.cartlight.com/merchant/keyes/donation.php?afid=conpet</p>
	<p> I promise you that I will not back down from this fight,<br />
 nor will I give one inch of ground on this sacred<br />
 battlefield of covenant marriage. I will not be badgered<br />
 or &#8220;punished&#8221; into silence or compromise on the<br />
 sacredness of Marriage as God created it.</p>
	<p> I refuse to let America end up like Canada, where it<br />
 is a crime to speak publicly &#8212; even from the pulpit &#8211;<br />
 against homosexual behavior without being held criminally<br />
 liable for &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; I refuse to let America become<br />
 like ancient Greece or ancient Rome, which rotted from<br />
 within while sexual confusion and debauchery ate away<br />
 at their national life.</p>
	<p> I must make one other point: we should all &#8220;love our<br />
 neighbor,&#8221; and that obviously includes men and women<br />
 who are struggling with homosexuality. All of us are<br />
 made in the image of God, and in fact we are *commanded*<br />
 to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Each of us<br />
 is entitled to respect and dignity while we are on our<br />
 life&#8217;s journey.</p>
	<p> We can and should love those who are in the homosexual<br />
 lifestyle. But that does NOT mean that we must elevate<br />
 that self-destructive lifestyle to the level of marriage.<br />
 Such an argument is absurd.</p>
	<p> Showing love and respect and unashamed witness to<br />
 individual homosexuals does not mean we have to embrace<br />
 or passively countenance the political agenda of the<br />
 homosexual movement, including their strong push now for<br />
 &#8220;same-sex marriage.&#8221; I showed utmost respect for the<br />
 &#8220;gay&#8221; interviewer and the seriousness of his questions,<br />
 even though he clearly believed he was &#8220;trapping&#8221; me<br />
 with his &#8220;gotcha&#8221; journalism &#8212; and I believe that my<br />
 unflinching response provided an essential witness for<br />
 truth, and for public integrity.</p>
	<p> In reality, the &#8220;homosexual marriage&#8221; movement is all<br />
 about distorting and evading the truth. It does not show<br />
 love for the homosexual, for it is based on a betrayal<br />
 of how God made humanity and the world. Nor would it<br />
 be loving to our children and our grandchildren to let<br />
 this movement put our entire nation in moral and ethical<br />
 chaos.</p>
	<p> Friend, here is the bottom line: I am in a position<br />
 where I could be the next Senator from the land of<br />
 Abraham Lincoln.</p>
	<p> This time next year, you could see me on C-Span, debating<br />
 for a Constitutional Amendment that reaffirms marriage is<br />
 between one man and one woman!</p>
	<p> This is the worst nightmare of the liberal ideologues<br />
 who are trying to defeat me; the worst nightmare of those<br />
 who are trying to create &#8220;homosexual marriage.&#8221;</p>
	<p> That is why I am under attack.</p>
	<p> And now I am asking you to do what everyone who supports<br />
 true marriage, everyone who professes religious conviction,<br />
 should be doing: stand with me.</p>
	<p> Our campaign&#8217;s fundraising, which was just kicking into<br />
 high gear, has suffered a blow, because some establishment<br />
 Republican figures have become fearful of the liberal<br />
 media&#8217;s attacks on me. Some of our GOP leaders are now<br />
 distancing themselves from my candidacy.</p>
	<p> Don&#8217;t back down. Don&#8217;t waver in your stand for the truth.<br />
 Don&#8217;t be silenced by the badgering of a few left-wing<br />
 media outlets. Above all: be not afraid! We will prevail<br />
 in our struggle &#8212; but only if good, God-fearing people<br />
 like you continue to support our campaign with your prayers<br />
 and, yes, your dollars.</p>
	<p> I need you to stand with me in my Senate race. My campaign<br />
 needs every penny it can raise, so that I can continue to<br />
 reach the voters in Illinois with the TRUTH about what I<br />
 stand for, and also so that I can show the voters what my<br />
 radical, pro-infanticide, pro-homosexual rights opponent<br />
 really stands for.</p>
	<p> I have just less than two months left in this race. It<br />
 is a race I can win&#8230;with the necessary resources from<br />
 supporters like you.</p>
	<p> Can I count on you to help my campaign with as generous<br />
 a gift as you can?</p>
	<p> https://secure.cartlight.com/merchant/keyes/donation.php?afid=conpet</p>
	<p> And, can you please forward this email to every friend<br />
 you have?</p>
	<p> Send a message to the media that you will not stand by<br />
 while they dishonestly push their left-wing agenda.</p>
	<p> Send a message to weak-kneed Republicans that you want<br />
 courageous, clear leadership, not fearful halting steps<br />
 and half-measures &#8212; while they look at the latest public<br />
 opinion poll.</p>
	<p> Send a message to the militant homosexual lobby that you<br />
 will not be silenced, and that you will not allow them<br />
 to browbeat us into submission to their destructive<br />
 agenda.</p>
	<p> I and my family beg you for your prayers, and I ask that<br />
 you give whatever you can to help my campaign. I thank<br />
 you with all my heart in advance. I&#8217;ll update you soon.</p>
	<p> Keeping Faith in the battle,</b></p>
	<div class="quote">Alan Keyes</div>
	<p><b> PS: Remember, the real agenda of the press and the<br />
 homosexual militants in their attack on me is to silence<br />
