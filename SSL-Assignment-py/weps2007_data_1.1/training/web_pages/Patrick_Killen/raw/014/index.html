Could it bepossible to have this letter published in your next issue?<BR>	<BR>Patrick Killen's 25 years of experience did not prevent him from makingsome mistakes and from twisting a fact. There is little that can be saidwhen he expresses his opinion on my activity as a model and I do not wishto debate if I am wrong or right, but Mr. Killen's article needs to be addressedon two other points at least.<BR>	<BR>The first one is the way my story on the Japanese cannibal, Issey Sagawa,was reported. Killen's short cut in putting together Sagawa's accusationsand death threats makes little sense, if any. When I started my six-monthinvestigation in 1992, I immediately found out that nobody in the Japanesepress wanted to cooperate with me for fear or of alienating Sagawa's reprisals.<BR>	<BR>Moreover, his network within the magazines was impressive and efficient;anybody asking questions about him was immediately pointed out to him ina matter of hours. To succeed, I decided to set up a Trojan horse, a fakedphoto-published with full knowledge by the magazine-to penetrate his network.A strategy which worked so perfectly that I was able to take photos evenin a video studio production totally sealed off from the media, which showedSagawa acting and dressed as a priest. Sagawa performed in various &quot;adultvideos&quot; as an actor and, with his clearance, I got copies of them..<BR>	<BR>The same way I had access to his inner circle of admirers who were willingand are still willing to repeat his crimes with him. I decided to stop theinside reporting after I had amassed a copious documentation on Sagawa'ssecret activities: findings which were published in the French magazine<STRONG>New Look</STRONG> in September, 1992, and now are on file at theFCCJ (Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan).<BR>	<BR>The story sent a huge shock wave throughout France. As a direct consequence,Sagawa could no longer travel in Europe. Obviously, Sagawa didn't care muchabout the set-up photo he did for the local press, but he did care aboutthe exposure of his perverse activities. As revenge for being outsmarted,he planted a story about a knife and fork allegedly painted by me in oneof his paintings and gave the story to whomever wanted to publish it. Veryfew journalists check the cannibal's words by asking him to show a photoof the painting without the knife and fork.<BR>	<BR>Killen's short cut creates the impression, a false one, that the Japanesecannibal's ire is righteous; a simplification that does not reflect thedepth and complexity of Sagawa's monstrosity. Patrick Killen quoted  Sagawa'sletters to <STRONG>Tokyo Journal</STRONG>, but ignored the <STRONG>TJ's</STRONG>editorial note put right under Sagawa's letter which made clear that Sagawawas bluntly lying. By quoting the editor's note, he could have, if he wanted,set the record straight. As a point of interest, Sagawa has recently appearedin <STRONG>Takarajima</STRONG> magazine #250, May 3, 1996, dressed in aschoolgirl's uniform; he is laying back on the floor while a half-nakedwoman is urinating on his face, a photo taken during the shooting of a newporno movie. Still people can be found who believe he is a victim of themedia, a role in which the Japanese cannibal excels.<BR>	<BR>Second point: Patrick Killen ends his article suggesting that my takingof a photo of Chizuo Matsumoto in court was motivated by greed and quotesthe Chairman of the Foreign Press in Japan, Dr. Khan. I directly asked Dr.Khan, &quot;What was this 'huge sum of money' I was supposed to have receivedfrom the <STRONG>Shukan Post</STRONG>?&quot; He flatly denied having givenan interview to Patrick Killen; he stated that he never said these wordsto anybody and what is more, he was very surprised to find himself quotedin the <STRONG>Weekender</STRONG>.<BR>	<BR>It would have been fair for him to have quoted me on that matter. Here ismy answer: &quot;I asked for my expenses to be refunded, &#165;200,000,mostly for the cost of the matchbox-sized cameras I had to buy.&quot; <BR>	<BR>There is no mention either that prints of the photo are now circulatingin the Japanese press, free of copyrights. Patrick Killen received one print,but never used it.<BR><BR><I>With respects,<BR>Antonio Pagnotta<BR>Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan</I><BR><BR>	<STRONG>(Editor's Note: In Pat Killen's story of approximately 1,450 words,he devoted approximately 88 to Mr. Pagnotta's episode with Sagawa. The remainderof the story involved the photographer's illicit picture taken at the Aumtrial. Incidentally, to those who might not remember or never have known,Issey Sagawa was convicted in Europe of killing and devouring his girl friendsome years ago. He was released because of a mental condition. <BR>	Killen replies to Antonio Pagnotta: &quot;My friend Antonio was a big helpin putting the story together. I am sorry he didn't like the last threeparagraphs. Maybe no one else read that far.&quot;)</TD></TR> <TR><TD ALIGN="Center"><HR><NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/PastEditions/960802/index.html">Home Page</A></NOBR> | <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/LatestEdition/LatestEdIndex.html">Latest Edition</A></NOBR> |<NOBR> <A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/PastEditions/PastEdsIndex.html">Past Editions</A></NOBR> | <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/MovieMusic/MoviesMusicIndex.html">Movies & Music</A></NOBR> | <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/EatingOut/EatingOutindex.html">Eating Out</A> </NOBR>|<NOBR> Life Style</NOBR> | <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/Eventcal/eventcalIndex.html">Events Calendar</A></NOBR> | <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/Vault/VaultIndex.html">The Vault</A></NOBR> |<NOBR> <A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/Bookstore/BookstoreIndex.html">Classifieds</A></NOBR> |<NOBR><A HREF="http://www.weekender.co.jp/ImageKK/ImageKKindex.html"> Image K.K.</A> </NOBR><P><NOBR><I><A HREF="mailto:tweditor@weekender.co.jp">E-mail: tweditor@weekender.co.jp</A></I></NOBR></TD></TR></TABLE> </BODY> </HTML>
