<font color="000000">Nevada -- In a battle of the outside interests, an official from the federal government came to Dayton Monday and warned the audience that Washington, D.C., interests were behind the Question 7 ballot initiative that would legalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana.<p>Scott Burns, deputy director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for State and Local Affairs, said the power behind the initiative was using Nevada as a "guinea pig" to see if it can legalize all drugs.</font>
<br><br><font color="000000">He spoke at a panel discussion at the Dayton Community Center on Question 7 sponsored by Healthy Communities Coalition of Lyon and Storey Counties, which opposes the measure.<p>"This initiative is funded 98 percent from Washington, D.C.," he said, naming John Sperling, founder of the University of Phoenix; Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance Co.; and billionaire investor George Soros and the money men behind the ballot measure. <p>"They picked us because our Western rural heritage is we don't like people like me coming in and telling you how to vote or what to do. They're not in Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware or Vermont. They think they can con you."<p>But Patrick Killen, of Las Vegas, who is the Question 7 communications director, said it was not an out-of-state effort.<p>"The reason this is on the ballot is because 86,000 Nevadans signed petitions to put it on the ballot," he said.<p>Killen and about 10 others protested outside the Dayton Community Center where the panel discussion took place.<p>"The reason we're here tonight is we believe Washington, D.C., needs to fix its own problems before telling Nevadans how to vote on a local issue," Killen said. "We support Question 7 because we believe that Nevada marijuana laws have failed and it's time for a sensible alternative. Question 7 would tax and regulate marijuana in Nevada, taking it away from violent gangs and drug dealers."<p>But Burns and other panel members, Las Vegas police officer Todd Raybuck and John Shields, head of the New Frontier Treatment Center in Fallon, said passage would make drug use more acceptable and encourage use among children.<p>"When I was in high school and college, it was a 'rite of passage' drug," Burns said. "Now it's a rite of passage drug for 10- to 12-year-olds."<p>Burns said that the drug use among youth is decreasing, and passage of Question 7 would make it seem like a normal thing to do.<p>"Why after we have worked so hard to lessen drug use in America would we want to make drugs more available?" he asked.<p>All of the panelists focused on the effect passage could have on children, and called it a "gateway drug" and insisted it was addictive.<p>"We do see a lot of folks addicted to marijuana," Shields said. "I don't think it would be in anyone's best interest to legalize it."<p>Raybuck, a 14-year veteran of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said today's marijuana is 50 percent to 70 percent more potent than it was in the 1960s and '70s and has a chilling effect on youth.<p>"The more powerful pot rewires the adolescent brain similar to heroin or cocaine," he said.<p>Raybuck told a story of two brothers. One brother, who never used drugs, stayed in school, had a career, family and a nice home. The other brother started smoking marijuana and kept smoking for 30 years. He went on to use methamphetamine and cocaine.<p>"He never held a job more than six months," Raybuck said. "He has two sons he never sees."<p>Raybuck said the brother is now doing a long stretch in prison for crimes he committed while on drugs.<p>"I can tell you about this brother, because he's my brother," Raybuck said.<p>Both Burns and Raybuck stated that even if Question 7 passes, federal law, which supersedes state law, still outlaws possession and use of marijuana.<p>But several of the 20-25 citizens who attended the panel discussion defended the initiative, though they did not give their names.<p>One woman stated that she lived in constant pain and would rather use marijuana than Vicodin or other prescribed drugs that leave her "like a zombie." <p>Another man criticized the amount of financial resources used in fighting drugs.<p>"I don't want kids smoking dope, drinking beer, or smoking cigarettes, but the war on drugs has been a failure," he said alleging that $42 billion was spent on law enforcement to fight drug use.<p>But Capt. Allan Veil of the Lyon County Sheriff's Office, who was standing in for Sheriff Sid Smith, said the department does not focus on busting pot users for marijuana smoking alone.<p>"We focus very little resources on marijuana use only," he said. "We focus on marijuana use along with that of other drugs and the crimes committed by marijuana users."<p>Veil said when he began as a deputy, possession of even a small amount of marijuana was a felony and served as a deterrent to use. <p>Now, he said, some parents keep it in the home.<p>"Kids are getting it from Mom and Dad, who are either their giving it to the kids or the kids are stealing from Mom and Dad's stash," he said.<p>"Drug use has declined because people have worked hard to reduce it," Burns said. "We're not going to accept this as inevitable and accommodate it."<p>Note: Pro-marijuana legalization protesters at panel discussion.<p>Source: Nevada Appeal (Carson City, NV)<br>Author: Karen Woodmansee, Appeal Staff Writer<br>Published: October 24, 2006<br>Copyright: 2006 Nevada Appeal<br>Contact:  <A HREF="mailto:editor@nevadaappeal.com">editor@nevadaappeal.com</A><br>Website: <a href="http://www.nevadaappeal.com/">http://www.nevadaappeal.com/</a><p>Related Articles & Web Site:<p>Regulate and Control Marijuana<br><a href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/">http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/</a><p>Group Key Backer of Marijuana Ballot Question<br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22315.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22315.shtml</a><p>Mr. Walters Goes To Nevada <br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22284.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22284.shtml</a><p>Drug Czar Visits Two States To Slam Pot Initiative<br><a href="http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22277.shtml">http://cannabisnews.com/news/thread22277.shtml</a></font>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><font color="#000000">I just wanted to point out to you, if you are reading and I know you've said some things before about judges and lawyers being no good -- since my own father is a lawyer I have experience of them, not just himself but his circle of friends who are also businessmen and landlords and people who you want to despise sometimes.<p>Some people are born into privilege through no choice of their own, and they inherit a culture which invests in them, which gives them every kind of support that they can, both moral and financial. There may be limits to this support, but it is there for emergencies.<p>I am privileged. I was gifted both in this way, and as a mentally quick young man with educational opportunities. I've chosen largely to walk away from my expected life course, and pursue what I believe to be good for the world as a whole, but still I do not forget myself. I need to know that I have a roof on my head and clothes to wear, food to eat and a wife that has the same advantages. We should not have to worry where our next meal will come from.<p>But then there are the vast number of people whose next meal really is in question. The people who do not know if there will be a next meal. I fast sometimes and that is nothing like being unsure if or when you will eat.<p>I spent a year not working, and I have set myself up for periods of time to be with very little or no money to have. I have had one dollar in my pocket and no idea if I'll have more today. I've had health problems and not known if they would ever relent, if I would ever spent a moment without pain again. I have sympathy for this, but it is not my goal to be like that when I have a choice.<p>I keep a feather in my back pocket, it's a company I could have started, a business that could have made me a billionaire. I had economists tell me so, and in the presence of my father so that he would know this. I entrusted the seed to his care and moved on. My wife and I live on about ten thousand dollars a year in Berkeley, not widely considered a cheap place to live.<p>My point is that there are good people who are privileged, if you think that I am good. Lawyers and judges, too. Sometimes.</font><br><br>

There is no doubt to me that the judge wants this case thrown out but he has to follow the formalities of procedure in order to make a record that will stand up on appeal.<p>The prosecutor is on a witch-hunt, and he made a "superseding indictment" which contained some new details and charges. The judge ridiculed this in open court, but in a restrained judicial way of speaking that sounds very pleasant and neutral.</font><br><br>

Doesn't he still have the right to not be tried again a 2nd time for what seems to me like the exact same charges?  I'm a little surprised that I haven't seen it come up already.

(DHCP problem, not under my control to fix, but it got fixed eventually after I notified someone.)<p>Went to the hearing before judge Charles Breyer regarding Ed Rosenthal and Richard Watts. Kenneth Hayes was not present. Counts 2,3,4,5 against Richard Watts have been dismissed, though the judge requested some written opinions of counsel before deciding whether that is with or without prejudice.<p>I'd rather wait for a press release from Ed or ASA to report on how his position stands now, but I will say that the judge did not seem too impressed with the prosecutor, and even lectured him on the first amendment at one point.<p>Literally the prosecutor is trying to make the case that Ed deserves to be re-prosecuted because he made remarks unfavorable to the government after the verdict last time.<p>Unbelievable.</font><br><br>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><font color="#000000">In Canada, income tax was supposed to be a temporary measure to pay for WW II. Like every other law, the representatives created it and used the undemocratic parliament to force it upon the people. Now it is just to guarantee payment of the national debts which have been used to manipulate the economy to make it easy (and cheap) to take over. The Government of Canada can have a 'majority' governmnet elected by a minority of the voters. (ie 40% pop vote can get a majority which is a de-facto dictatorship for 4 years.)<p>The 'government' has not really represented the wishes or protected the interests of the populace for decades.<p>Pot is probably the only thing that is cheaper here. Despite the structural differences, what happens there is mirrored here, our 'culture' is not so different although the system is.</font><br><br>

Where do we start, to stop this?<p>On a note of vindication, I walked into work today, and the guys all started telling me that the voting machines were down, and there was a big deal about it in the paper, that the Republicans were purging the...blah, blah, blah.

 <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Shaquille O'Neal was present during a botched child pornography raid last month while working in Virginia as a reserve sheriff's deputy, a Bedford County Sheriff's officer said.

Kobe doesn't like wanna-bes, and Shaq is bringing much needed attention to the militarization of the police, and it's side effects.<p>Just part of what the 'war on drugs' has accomplished, paving the war to the loss of Habeas Corpus, fulfilling all of our predictions that bush would live up to his promise to be a 'diktator' at his first press conference. Todays' press conference should be his last, he ran off the stage huffing and beet red, pissed at the questions that were being asked that weren't asked when they should of been.<p>Don't celebrate yet, there's lots of election stealing going on as we speak, though likely this time to be exposed after the elections, which is fine, either way, the truth is coming out, if anyone hasn't noticed!<p>What has the NBA and  being Drug-free done for Shaq:
(team players must know he's likely a narc, a big secret in the press, likely not amongst the players, this blows his cover regardless, anyone care to digress?)<p>The Miami Heat center, who pursues his interest in law enforcement during the offseason, denied Tuesday taking part in serving the search warrant at the wrong house Sept. 23. However, Bedford County Sheriff's Lt. Michael Harmony confirmed to The Associated Press that O'Neal was there.<p>O'Neal, in Orlando to play a preseason game Tuesday, was asked about the raid and several times somewhat playfully responded, "It wasn't me."<p><a href="http://rawstory.com/showarticle.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Fapnews.myway.com%2F%2Farticle%2F20061025%2FD8KVM5CO0.html">http://rawstory.com/showarticle.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Fapnews.myway.com%2F%2Farticle%2F20061025%2FD8KVM5CO0.html</a></font><br><br>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><font color="#000000">Steve Watson & Alex Jones / Infowars.net | October 25 2006<p>In his new film <I>America: Freedom To Fascism</I>, Aaron Russo expertly exposes the traitorous Federal Reserve Act and the fact that there is no law that stipulates American citizens have to pay income taxes. The ratification of the 16th amendment, also known as the "Tax amendment", represents a fundamental undermining of Constitutional law in America. It is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated against the American people by the elite private banking institutions that have usurped government as an arm of their overall control mechanism.<p>Russo presents interviews with an impressive range of government officials, IRS special agents , FBI officers, Politicians and tax attorneys who have researched and subsequently campaigned against the Federal Reserve Act and thus reveals why the IRS is an illegal foundation.<p>The income tax does not meet either criteria of Constitutionally legal taxation in America, that is direct apportioned tax or indirect uniform tax. The IRS claims that the 16th Amendment allowed for a third form of taxation, however, the Supreme court ruling on the amendment states that it allows for no new forms of taxation. More supreme court cases in the same period confirm the same conclusion. The 16th Amendment did not allow the Federal Government to levy a new tax, thus there is no Constitutional basis for the income tax.<p>(read the rest at <a href="http://www.infowars.net/articles/October2006/251006Russo.htm">http://www.infowars.net/articles/October2006/251006Russo.htm</a> )</font><br><br>

And most people don't move on to those other powders up the nose things, anyway.<p>Also, in 2002 a Univ. of Iowa researcher told me they had been doing PET scans for some 5 years-the results:<p>1) marijuana increases blood flow in the ventral areas-where emotional thoughts are processed-think love.<p>2) no permanent brain changes from even chronic and heavy usage of marijuana.<p>3) specifically, no "rewiring" of the "stimulus-reward axis" like with those stimulant powders up the nose-cocaine hard wires the axis-which is why it is tough to beat such addictions-due to the heavy dopamine surges (100-200%) the worst one being cigarettes.  Marijuana increases dopamine by about 35%-the same as for acquisition of food.  And food isn't subject to 10-20 years like marijuana possession is, etc.<p>"Marijuana-don't have carbs".  Nice touch.

They'll have no trouble hanging the kid when he grows up to be a 'criminal' because he 'failed to make the right choices'."<p>Lombar, you hit the nail right on the head, my friend.  I tell people that all the time, and I call those people for what they are: "anti-abortion" or "anti-choice".  If you don't like abortion and want it to be outlawed, that's your prerogative.  But if you are in favor of the death penalty, you are NOT "pro-life".  It boggles my mind how many people don't pick up on that.  I personally will not let someone off the hook that easily.<p>As for the planet, it is not our toilet.  Recycling and renewable fuels and materials alone would solve our problem.  I'm convinced of it.  We recycle here at home, and it's not that difficult.  And it really does make us feel like we're doing some good.  But I wonder what really happens to it, since the garbage trucks are the ones that pick it up.  If only I knew for sure that that waste was really going to the recycling center and not the landfill, it would help me to sleep better.</font><br><br>

They would talk about how they were going to vote so-n-so in next election, and the people of the county were just sick and tired of having to watch their backs just to have a drink or two, and saddened by having to attend funerals of their children who died on their way back from the wet counties, because even the bootleggers wouldn't sell to children, but some of the liquor stores at the state line, would. A young teenager can get drunk on just a beer or two. By the time they drove thirty miles back from getting the booze which they always consumed on the way back, they were driving drunk.  "We'll vote it wet this time!" It never happened. Today, as you drive through these dry counties, you can see white crosses marking the spot where a child missed the T in the road, or went straight in a curve, it's sad.

Missed any critical thinking that might have somehow snuck its way into the educational systems?<p>Since the 'state' never knew how much drug use there was/is, it is not possible to know if drug use has risen, declined or stayed the same overall. We can measure hospital admissions, criminal arrests, and treatment industry statistics but none of these can truly guage the levels of drugs use in actuality.<p>Cannabis users are an officially hated subgroup within society. The status quo of this is maintained by constant lies and misdirection to support the profits for police, pharmas, tobacco and alcohol industries . It is greed, prejudice and hatred at its core that drives it all which makes it thouroughly rotten and these people flying the banners 'for the children' are despicable human beings, barely worthy of the sack of flesh they inhabit! Society is being held hostage and being extorted by deception, criminals worldwide can rejoice because hell will freeze over before these people ever see reason.</font><br><br>

They tell people what a loser I am because I don't own property, or big boy toys, and I don't go to "church" every week. Well, it's been a hard f*cking life not having the support of my family that most people just take for granted. I tell them I've defeated my alcoholism with cannabis use, and I don't care about owning anything, renting is just fine with me. Only very recently have they even begun giving me the time of day. I must admit though, they are coming around about 9-11. Inch by inch, step by step, slowly they turn.<p>Toke.</font><br><br>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><font color="#000000">I want to say one more thing about fear and terrorism. I don't know about any of you, but since 9/11 I have not seen ONE SINGLE PERSON express abject or even significant fear of terrorists or terrorist attack, not one. And I know I personally don't walk around in any kind of fear of that. That is the reason I get so angry and frustrated at all this supposition on the part of politicians that anyone in the country is ready to trade any liberty for security. I haven't seen ANYTHING of the sort!<p>So I find it extremely insulting that our so-called "leaders" attribute to us this fearful, terrorized state without really checking to see if we really are in that state. We're NOT in that state. We are a lot tougher than that. I think they are making it up, and everyone just assumes it's the OTHER guy who's so afraid. Meanwhile, none of us actually are, and it's a con game being played by the politicians.<p>If you come right to the point and ask any American point-blank "Are you willing to live in a Cuba-like police state to be guaranteed that there will be no more terrorist attacks here" I assure you, every last person would say "no way!" </font><br><br>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><font color="#000000">I was disgusted yesterday to see in the San Francisco Chronicle a three page---not just a double spread, but a THREE-full-page ad for the movie United 93. At first it just seemed odd, because that movie has already had its main run, and people are not really seeing it anymore. Its run was months ago. Why suddenly are they running this massive ad for it now, I asked myself. <p>Then it hits me---it's 2 weeks before the election, and they (whoever `they' are, I guess it's Universal Pictures working hand in hand with the GOP) want everyone to think about the "terrarists" again and be afraid, very afraid, and vote rethuglican. This exposes yet again how this film is nothing but propaganda. They trot it out shamelessly to try to scare people and manipulate them emotionally and politically.<p>It seems a rather futile attempt to put it in the SF Chonicle, since SF and the bay area are so heavily liberal, but maybe it's an effort to convert a few, I don't know. I just know it's blatantly icky coming so close to the election.<p>I felt dirty after seeing this spread, and wanted to take another shower. </font><br><br>
