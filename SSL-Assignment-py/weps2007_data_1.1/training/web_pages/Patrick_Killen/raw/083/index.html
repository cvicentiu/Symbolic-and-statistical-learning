<B><P>Kings not amused. Titans earn 6<SUP>th</SUP> home win, 4-1.</P>
</B><P>By Roger Clarke</P>
<P>The Minor Bantam Titans entertained the Kings for the first time this season. Both teams started the game playing a tight checking, conservative style. The Titans got into penalty trouble early in the period resulting in a King goal on the power play; however, Sam Coyne returned the favour by scoring on a nice feed from Linden Balm on the Titan power play.</P>
<P>The Kings pressed for the lead goal but Titan’s goaltender, Patrick Killen, frustrated the King’s forwards with his spectacular play. The Titans found themselves killing another penalty late in the period but Patrick Lester almost single-handedly stymied the King’s offence. Sam Coyne scored his second goal of the game after Scott Pleadwell and Shayne Thompson pressed the Kings defence with their tenacious fore-checking. </P>
<P>The Titans began to dominate the play in the second period and were rewarded with their third goal of the game when Coyne chipped the puck to Damian Cross who undressed the defenceman and goaltender only to lose the puck off the end of his stick as he was about to deposit it into the empty net. Cross recovered the puck at the side of the net and fed Pleadwell with a nifty pass, who buried it behind the sprawling King’s goaltender. The Titans put the game out of reach when libero, Chad Patrick made an outstanding play to keep the puck in the offensive zone. Pleadwell and Cross passed the puck with ease in the offensive zone finding Shayne Thompson in the slot. His marker gave the Titans a 4-1 lead going into the third period. </P>
<P>In the final frame, the Titans protected their lead by reverting to their strong defensive game. Moreau, McNeely and Bahm used their physical play to clog the neutral zone and when the Titans got into penalty difficulties, the Titan penalty killers played the trap to perfection, thwarting any comeback attempt by the Kings.</P>
