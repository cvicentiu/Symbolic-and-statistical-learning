   TOKYO — Edward Neilan, columnist and Asia-based correspondent who covered some of the region's most tumultuous events from the Vietnam War to Tiananmen Square, died Tuesday at his Tokyo home of a heart attack. He was 68. 
<P>
At the time of his death, Mr. Neilan served on the editorial board of and wrote a weekly column for <i>World Tribune.com</i>. 
He was also a media fellow at the Hoover Institution and served as a special correspondent for <i>The Washington Times</i>, contributing occasional articles including daily coverage of the groundbreaking summit in May between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.<P>
"Ed was a fine, knowledgeable journalist and an innovative editor. He could turn a phrase with the best of them," said Patrick Killen, a 30-year veteran of <i>United Press International</i>.<P>
"When he first heard we were launching an online publication dedicated to international news, Ed Neilan wanted to be a part of it," said Robert Morton, president of East West Services which publishes <i>World Tribune.com</i>. "He has remained one of our most enthusiastic contributers and was offering suggestions by e-mail as recently as two weeks ago." <P>
Mr. Neilan's syndicated column on Asian affairs appeared in more than 30 newspapers including the <i>Honolulu Star-Bulletin, El Mercurio</i> in Chile, the <i>Japan Times</i>, the <i>Straits Times</i> in Singapore, and the <i>Korea Herald</i>.<P>
In 1986, Mr. Neilan realized his dream of returning to the other side of the Pacific when <i>The Washington Times</i> sent him to Tokyo as its Northeast Asia Bureau Chief.<P>
Except for brief visits to the United States, he settled in Tokyo and never returned.<P>
Edward Arthur Neilan was born in 1932 in Los Angeles, where his father was a screenwriter. He graduated from the University of Southern California, where he was editor of the <i>Daily Trojan</i> student newspaper.<P>
He first visited Asia in 1957, to advise the <i>Korea Herald</i>, then a new English-language paper based in Seoul. He then wrote for the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> from Tokyo.<P>
In 1962, he was named China and Southeast Asia bureau chief for <i>Copley News Service</i>. Based in Hong Kong, he made frequent reporting trips into Vietnam to cover the war.<P>
From his days there, he kept a photograph of a bullet hole in the floor of a helicopter — a bullet that had just missed his foot as he sat in the flying chopper writing a story.<P>
In Vietnam, he broke a story about the Viet Cong using a huge network of underground tunnels to protect themselves from B-52 carpet bombings.<P>
In the 1970s, he wrote from Washington as a diplomatic correspondent for <i>Copley News Service</i> before founding the <i>Asia Mail</i>, a monthly tabloid-size journal of American perspectives on Asia and the Pacific.<P>
At Tiananmen, when reports surfaced of a split within the military, with some divisions reportedly backing the protesters, Mr. Neilan got into a rented car and drove around Beijing. He saw soldiers relaxed, chatting with each other, as if waiting for the signal to charge to the center of Beijing.<P>
"On the basis of that, he filed a story that reports of a possible civil war were simply false," said Martin Sieff, managing editor of UPI and former assistant foreign editor of The Times. "He was one of the finest, shrewdest and street-smart reporters of his generation."<P>
Mr. Neilan began writing his syndicated column, from his home in Tokyo, in 1993. Two years later, he joined the Hoover Institution as a media fellow and for the past year served as a senior fellow for the Heritage Foundation.<P>
He was "a superb writer, a clear thinker and a straight shooter," said Heritage President Edwin F. Feulner.<P>
Mr. Neilan is survived by his wife, Masae Sato, and two daughters, Carolyn Neilan of San Francisco and Andrea Neilan of Boston. Memorial services are pending.
