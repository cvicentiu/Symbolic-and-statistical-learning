<P>Version 5.0.1.2.11 makes minor modification allowing SyncLine SlideShows
forward compatibility with Version 6.</P>
<P>Version 5.0.1.2.12 corrects issues related to slide-mismatchs in
slideshow-editor. See note Version 6.0.2.2 below for description of problem. 
</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.2. Adds double click zoom to viewer, support for AVI/MPEG
clips to be used as slides, optional tool bar for full screen display, fixed
issues associated with zip encryption.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.3. This version is a &quot;must have&quot; if you are using
linked audio. Corrects issues associated with linked audio narration on a drive
other that the logged drive. Corrects linkage issues associated with SlideShow
Editor, audio link editing.. Adds two new options under advanced save: One for
path stripping when image file is on the same path as the pss file, the other
strips all paths from the pss file. The two new options complement the original
&quot;normal&quot; save option which always adds the path, needed or not. The
options were added so that fast, non-copy saves could be applied to pss files
without changing the original non-pathed contents. </P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.4 ... Corrects issues related to syncline editing. Version
6.0.1.1 - 6.0.1.3 if only one audio clip was used, and it was moved before and
not saved, and a syncline was started, the syncline index was not correctly
processed. Additonally, psscd, psscd+, and psscdv5 have been patched to
correctly process pss file format 2.0 synclines. </P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.5 added easy to access update links.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.6 Improves screen switching between fullscreen and normal.
Cleans up some inconsistent behavior with the full screen play menu selection.
Corrects issues related to slide show save on win 2000 machines. Sometimes, if
only new slides were imported, and the slideshow was saved with copy option,
the directory browse component would issue an untrapped error, aborting the
save action. Additionally, an issue related to composite printing, last page of
images didn't print, has been corrected.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.7 Corrects issues related to multiple copy saves to same
folder and resize copies that include sound slides. The latter was introduced
in version 6 when fast copy component was incorporated.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.9... Clears up some issues related to image browsing function
and some inconsistencies associated with text annotation display processing
when switching between normal and full screen modes.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Version 6.0.1.10</FONT> Corrects an issue arose in
version 6.0.1.9 related to slideshows with annotations. This is an important
update and corrects what I consider a significant problem.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.11 Adds save wizard to help you decide which slideshow save
format to use.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.1.12 Improves print formatter performance with defaults allowing
images to expand to fit available space. Optionally, the output can be forced
to keep image at original resolution or below. Corrects issue associated with
drag and drop of thumbnails when using List Manager.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Version 6.0.2.1</FONT> recently it was discovered that
authorization level was not properly processing. As a result, MPEG output would
be disabled even with entry of proper password. Password associated issues
related to MPEG have been resolved. The other resolved issue relates to
occasional shimmering in MPEG movies. Previous releases stored reference frames
used during MPEG conversion in JPEG format. With this release, buffered
reference frames are saved in lossless PNG format and, as a result, the
MPEG/VCD output quality is significantly improved.... If you are doing VCD/MPEG
work. this download is worth the time it takes to do it.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.2 Improved Syncline function in the following areas: (1) Auto
distributing images on syncline immediately following work space slide move
cause some wrong images to show up in the syncline slide viewer strip. The
issue did not affect slideshow output. Issue fully resolved, links to hold list
rather than current display list were being used in slide viewer strip update.
(2) Issues associated with operation of syncline preview audio control bar and
preview button, resulting in malfunction of replay and relocate audio play
position. Issue resolved, I disabled automatic control functions and forced
explicit processing of media player controls.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.3. Corrects display issues associated with preview during AVI
generations. The issued did not impact AVI generation and has been corrected. 
</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.4 Adds support for persistant selection list pocessing...
Browse though multiple slideshows and folders selecting images as you go. Save
selected images as PLS file for processing with ThumbNail Refinery or as a
slideshow (pss file). Adds slide property dialog, including EXIF data if
available, you can view from the slideshow browser screen.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.5. Issue: version 6 would strip paths from syncline elements
and, if the elements were not located in the same folder as the PSS file, the
syncline slides would be dropped during load because they could not be
located.. Corrective action: paths are now included in syncline elements in the
same manner as other slides, as specified in Dependent Slideshow save options.
TWAIN save to JPG now uses EXIF JPEG tagging each scan with the system time at
the time of scan... very handy for keeping track of scanned slides.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.6. Issue: synclines will not save as a result of a pathing
problem introduced in version 6.0.2.5. Corrective action was taken to insure
that synclines save correctly. Syncline annotations can now added using
syncline editor.</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.7. Changed Save menu option labels to make associated actions
more clear. </P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.9 standard slideshow that are converted to AVI+ now
incorporate dwell time into the frame count computation. This means slide
display time in AVI+ files converted from an SSR slideshow will closely
resemble the display time seen during SSR playback of the original slideshow. 
</P>
<P>Version 6.0.2.10 adds Batch Copy Utility</P>
