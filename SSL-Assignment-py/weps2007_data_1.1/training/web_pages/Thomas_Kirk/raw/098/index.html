  <P>In typically disjointed manner, he then sends his respects to some friends,
  and discusses the weather before closing, &quot;from your affection husband
  alvy kirk.&quot; The final letters in the group, written in 1864, are successively
  briefer and more terse. On Jan. 16, from Culpeper, Virginia, Kirk tells
  Mariah he'll be home by the following winter &quot;if I dont make up my
  mind to enlist over again. The big bounty looks tempting at a man.&quot;
  In the next paragraph, he adds: &quot;...I want you to have four bottles
  of brandy setting on the table for me when I come home...&quot; The letter
  is signed &quot;from your lawful husband A. Kirk to my wife Mariah Kirk.&quot;
  Later, he writes that he has decided to forgo re-enlistment and the furlough
  it would have entitled him: he has had enough of war. And in a curt letter
  dated April 8, 1864, with no location, he writes: &quot;I would think a
  little more of you if you would write a little oftener. If you don't write
  I will look out for another woman and see if she will think more of me
  than you do...&quot;</P>
  <P>Alvah Kirk's letters provide an interesting counterpoint to the recent
  wave of important books, films, and diaries from the Civil War. Though
  never directly revealing, these awkward, blunt messages -- so palpably
  lacking in joy, humor, warmth, or pride -- have much to say about the anguish
  of their author. They suggest the emotional privation and fear of an ordinary,
  unlettered American, among the millions caught up in a national cataclysm:
  a man who, like many of his comrades, was painfully uncomfortable with
  words, and above all wanted to get home alive. This sad self- portrait
  left me with many questions: about the personality of the author, and the
  life and family he left behind; what, if anything, Mariah wrote to Alvah;
  through whose hands the letters came down to me more than a century and
  a quarter later; whether any of Alvah's descendants had kept them, and
  wondered about him as I did.</P>
  <P>In time, I was able to learn a bit more about Alvah Kirk. Local census
  data and newspaper records offered some sparse details. He was born around
  1831. In 1851, at age twenty, he married sixteen-year-old Sarah Louisa
  Hicks, from a Quaker family, and in 1855 they had a daughter named &quot;Anice.&quot;
  Sarah died in 1859 at age twnety-four, and Anice died in 1860 at age five.
  Causes of the deaths are not given. Alvah is listed in the 1860 census
  as a laborer; he owned no property, but had an estate valued at $100.00.</P>
  <P>Shortly after Sarah Hicks's death, Alvah married Mariah, who was then
  twenty-eight and also formerly married. Her ancestry is given as Irish,
  but no maiden name is recorded. The census does not mention Alvah's origins.
  Enlistment records indicate that he was a U.S. citizen when he entered
  the Union Army. Alvah and Mariah had a son, George, in 1860, and a daughter,
  Ann, in 1861. &quot;Tommy&quot; was born in 1855, and must have been either
  Alvah and Sarah's son (perhaps Anice's twin), or possibly Mariah's by her
  previous marriage. They shared a house with another family, headed by one
  Isaac Benoway, on Davies Street near Mill Street in Poughkeepsie. Thus,
  it appeared that in the brief period from 1859 to 1861, Alvah had lost
  both a wife and daughter to causes unknown; remarried, fathered two more
  children (George and Ann), and gone away to war.</P>
  <P>Extensive, if sketchy, records exist of Civil War regiments, most of
  them official compilations from the late nineteenth century. According
  to these sources, Alvah joined up with the Ninety-fifth Regiment, New York
  Volunteers at Carmel, New York, on January 14, 1862. He signed on for the
  standard hitch of three years, for $13 a month. Bounties of up to $300
  for enlisting were not uncommon, especially later in the war, when there
  was a shortage of recruits; but there is no indication that Alvah got one.
  The brief official narrative in F.H. Dyer's Compendium of the War of the
  Rebellion, a three-volume work compiled at the turn of the century, reveals
  that the Ninety-fifth New York was right in the thick of the fighting in
  the Eastern theater. The unit, also known as the &quot;Warren Rifles,&quot;
  was organized in New York City between November 1861 and March 1862, when
  it left to participate in the defense of Washington. In the spring of 1862,
  the regiment joined Abner Doubleday's brigade of the Army of Virginia;
  later it was transferred to Gen. John Pope's Army of the Potomac. The major
  engagements that summer and fall in which the Ninety-fifth took part included
  the second battle of Bull Run (August 30), South Mountain, Maryland (September
  14), Antietam (September 16-17), and Fredericksburg (December 12-15). During
  the following spring and summer -- the period when Kirk's letters began
  -- the regiment saw action at Chancellorsville (May 2-4 1863), where Union
  forces under Gen. Hooker were defeated, and at Gettysburg (July 1-3).In
  early May 1864, just a few weeks after Kirk's final letter from Virginia,
  the Ninety-fifth saw action at the Battle of the Wilderness, and a week
  later at Spotsylvania -- bloody, chaotic battles fought in densely wooded
  terrain, which failed to position Grant's armies for a final thrust against
  Richmond. It was here that Grant, conceding he could only beat Lee by attrition,
  issued the famous dispatch: &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line,
  if it takes all summer.&quot; James M. McPherson writes in Battle Cry of
  Freedom that &quot;From May 5 to 12 the Army of the Potomac lost some 32,000
  men killed, wounded, and missing -- a total greater than for all Union
  armies combined in any previous week of the war.&quot; A few weeks later
  there came another costly and inconclusive battle at Cold Harbor, after
  which Grant was forced to retreat across the James River. In the spring
  of 1865, the Ninety-fifth took part in the Siege of Petersburg, and then
  joined in the pursuit of Lee to Appomattox Court House, Virginia, where
  he finally surrendered to Grant on April 9. The regiment was mustered out
  in Washington in July 1865.</P>
  <P>Personnel and casualty records for the Ninety-fifth, as for other units,
  are inexact. A regiment normally consisted of ten companies, with between
  86 and 101 men in each. It is unlikely the Ninety-fifth ever had more than
  a thousand men in uniform at any one time, but considering turnover --
  losses, transfers, replace- ments -- the aggregate was probably closer
  to 1400. Various official sources agree that the regiment suffered losses
  of 119 officers and men killed in action and 136 or 137 who died of disease.
  In addition, one source lists 329 missing in action (captured, deserted,
  or killed and never found) and 381 wounded but recovered; this last category
  probably overlaps with others. But if these figures are reasonably accurate,
  the regiment's overall casualties must have approached or exceeded 50 percent.</P>
  <P>In a musty, 43-volume register prepared at the turn of the century by
  the New York State Adjutant's Office in Albany, I found capsule biographies
  of three or four lines each for most of the New York soldiers. Sitting
  in the main reading room of the New York Public Library, I felt a surge
  of excitement as I thumbed the pages. I wasn't prepared for what lay in
  store. On page 378 of the thirty-second volume, I was stunned to find the
  entry; for a few seconds it felt as if I had lost a brother.</P>
  <P>KIRK, ALVAH.--Age, 34 years. Enlisted at Carmel, to serve three years,
  and mustered in as private, Co. K, January 14, 1862; wounded in action,
  May 6 and 12, 1864, at the Wilderness, Va.; died of wounds, May 30, 1864,
  at Harewood Hospital, Washington, D.C.; also borne as Alvis Kirk.</P>
  <P>Despite the cost, and the lack of refrigeration, bodies of the Union
  dead were sometimes shipped home; however, Alvah Kirk's wasn't among them.
  As I learned from a telephone call, he is buried at Arlington National
  Cemetery, along with thousands of comrades whose graves, by the end of
  the Civil War, spilled over onto the grounds of Robert E. Lee's estate.
  (I also learned, from the same volume that announced Alvah's death, that
  his younger brother William, wounded at Gettysburg, survived the war. The
  wound probably wasn't serious, as he wasn't discharged until the end of
  1864, a full year and a half after that battle.)</P>
  <P>From the New York State Archives, I obtained the muster rolls prepared
  in 1865 for the Bureau of Military Records, which provided a few more details
  about Kirk. These included one surprise: that he wasn't originally from
  Poughkeepsie, but was born in Kent, in nearby Putnam County. The town clerk
  of Kent put me in touch with several local history buffs and genealogists.
  All of these local historians were helpful; it struck none of them as odd
  that someone might want to follow the faint track of an obscure and illiterate
  soldier. Several, in fact, knew of the Kirk family. One genealogist, Ms.
  Betty Light Behr, assisted me in obtaining town records such as tax lists,
  census data, cemetery lists, and unpublished local histories. After reading
  the Kirk letters she wrote back to me: &quot;I find that you have been
  touched by [the letters] in such a way that you wish to accord a rarely
  given recognition to their veiled and eloquent record. These wartime circumstances
  often enveloped ordinary hard working people, who endured and paid the
  price, and were forgotten.&quot;</P>
  <P>The Kirk family was well-known in the sparse, rugged hills of Putnam
  County. There is even a Kirk Lake near the town of Mahopac. William S.
  Pelletreau's nineteenth century history of the county notes that &quot;this
  handsome body of water...takes its name from an old man by the name of
  Kirk, who lived near it; and abounds in excellent fish.&quot; The family
  is of Scottish ancestry -- &quot;Kirk&quot; being the Scottish term for
  chapel, church plot, or parish -- and settled originally in nearby western
  Connecticut. Tax rolls list a Thomas Kirk in neighboring Dutchess County
  as early as 1753. Putnam was a mining region, known for its native stone
  and ores, but most of the Kirks appear to have been farmers or carpenters.
  The census and cemetery records indicate that Alvah P. Kirk (middle name
  unknown) was born around 1829 to Calvin and Annis Kirk, who lived in Ludingtonville,
  a hamlet that forms part of the town of Kent in upper Putnam County. Calvin
  and Alvah were listed as carpenters. According to the 1850 Federal Census
  for Putnam County, Alvah was the oldest of seven children. In addition
  to William, he had three other younger brothers: George, John, and Levi;
  and two younger sisters, Hannah M., and Mary E. Alvah married Sarah L.
  Hicks, his first wife, at the Presbyterian church in Pleasant Valley, N.Y.
  Jackson Hicks, whom Alvah refers to several times in the letters, and who
  served with him in the Ninety-fifth, is his brother-in-law, Sarah's brother.
  I also learned that Company K of the Ninety-fifth New York Volunteers had
  been consolidated from companies in Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland counties,
  under the command of Capt. William F. Bailey. The thirty-six members of
  the company from Putnam County, including Alvah and William Kirk, are listed
  in Pelletreau's History of Putnam County. A cousin, Horace Kirk, also served
  in the Ninety-fifth; Warren Kirk, from another branch of the family, served
  in the Seventeenth Connecticut Volunteer Infantry; a Thomas Kirk served
  in the Fifty-ninth New York Volunteers. Alvah's parents, Calvin and Annis,
  both lived into their seventies, dying a few months apart in 1880.</P>
  <P>In the card catalogues of the New York Public Library, I was able to
  locate two obscure references to the Ninety-fifth New York Regiment. One
  of these, which I eventually tracked down at the Library of Congress, turned
  out to be a bizarre blind alley: it led to an inept, melodramatic novella,
  written in 1901 by a Union veteran. The plot involved daring wartime escapades,
  hidden treasure, a secret code, and pulp romance. The regiment in the story
  was called the Ninety-fifth New York, and the reference was duly catalogued.</P>
  <P>The other reference was more interesting: a lengthy article about the
  actual Ninety-fifth written by one of its officers, E.L. Barnes, which
  appeared in 1886 in the National Tribune, a precursor to the Army newspaper
  Stars and Stripes. It is a literate and informed account (if not lacking
  in regimental pride) of the unit's service in 1862 under Brigadier Gen.
  Abner Doubleday, in the Army of the Potomac.</P>
  <P>According to Barnes, the Ninety-fifth was initially deployed in April
  to Acquia Creek, Virginia, where for several months it worked on reconstructing
  a railroad destroyed by the enemy. Its initiation into combat came later
  that summer, in artillery barrages along the Rapahannock River. At one
  point, the Confederates began firing iron railroad rails cut in twelve-to-
  sixteen inch lengths; but as Barnes explains, &quot;We were well protected
  by the sloping side of the hills from any missiles except shells, so that
  the railroad track thus sent us in sections was not utilized as a medium
  of travel to the other world.&quot; Much of the Barnes article is devoted
  to the Virginia campaign during the late summer of 1862. The regiment's
  first big battle was at Thoroughfare Gap, followed by Second Manassas (August
  30), where Barnes puts the best face on the defeat of the Union forces:
  &quot;...the whole line fell back, pressed by the enemy. Several regimental
  formations were broken, but no rout occurred, as the men were not panicstricken,
  but fell back fighting, although in some confusion.&quot; Lee invaded Maryland
  in September, and there followed a series of engagements, including South
  Mountain and Antietam, where, in the single bloodiest day of the war, the
  Confederates were turned back. Barnes himself received a severe hip wound
  at South Mountain that ended his fighting career, as well as his chronicle
  of the Ninety-fifth. But the article concludes with a fierce volley: Had
  there been as much unity of feeling and action and as ready obedience rendered
  among the higher officers as were given and existed in the ranks...a far
  different result would have been reached in [the campaign of 1862]... Not
  one jot or tittle of credit would I abate [the armies of the West] for
  their glorious work. The Army of the Potomac, however, is deserving of
  greater credit. It suffered defeats and achieved barren victories for several
  years, and through it all remained hopeful and sanguine, never losing heart
  or faith in the cause it had patriotically espoused, but willing again
  and again to be led and hurled against its brave and active opponent --
  the Army of Northern Virginia.</P>
  <P>Local newspapers, available on microfilm at libraries in Poughkeepsie
  and Carmel, failed to turn up an obituary for Alvah Kirk, or any information
  about the Ninety-fifth. The Poughkeepsie Eagle, a four-page daily, seemed
  more devoted to offering escape from the war than news of it. The front
  page was largely given over to windy speeches by New York's senators, advertisements
  for products such as &quot;Dr. Duponco's Golden Pills for Females,&quot;
  and odd swatches of poetry. No casualty lists were published, even in the
  heat of military campaigns. Broad accounts of the fighting appeared inside;
  but the only front-page evidence that men from Poughkeepsie were dying
  in a war just a few hundred miles away was the advertisements for mourning
  attire.</P>
  <P>Like the Poughkeepsie Eagle, the Putnam County Courier, which appeared
  monthly and at times weekly, seemed almost to mock my historical curiosity.
  The Courier was a Democratic paper, and virulently anti-Lincoln; it referred
  to the draft as &quot;Father Abraham's lottery of life,&quot; and editorialized
  continuously on behalf of the presidential campaign of General George B.
  McClellan. Like not a few other journals, the Courier vilified Lincoln
  as an imbecile and a virtual freak, but mourned his death with sudden eloquence.
  On its front page, the Courier ran diverting stories and travel notes from
  Europe, but virtually no news of local men in the war. Most of the death
  notices were for local people who died of natural causes.</P>
  <P>A query to the National Archives in Washington produced a series of
  documents, received in several installments over a six-month period, and
  some further tantalizing scraps of information about Kirk. A month after
  the call, I received photocopies of two carded medical records, each occupying
  a half-page, and a bureaucratic promise of more records to follow. The
  first card lists the name as &quot;Alva/bie Kirk,&quot; and states that
  he was admitted to Harewood Hospital on May 26, 1864, and died on May 31,
  with the additional commentary:</P>
  <P>DIAGNOSIS: &quot;G.S.W. [gunshot wound] L Leg Ampt L Leg on Field.&quot;
  REMARKS: &quot;Wounds.&quot;</P>
  <P>The second card, a surgical record, lists the patient as &quot;Alvil
  Kirk&quot; and the injury as &quot;G.S.W. left leg.&quot; It indicates
  that he was wounded at &quot;Spottsylvania&quot; [sic] on May 12, and operated
  on the same day: &quot;Amputation left leg middle third circular.&quot;
  It then states: RESULT: &quot;Died May 31, 1864. Exhaustion.&quot;</P>
  <P>A month later, a second batch of records from the National Archives
  arrived in the mail. It contained nine legal-size photocopies of War Department
  documents, including regimental and company muster rolls similar to the
  medical cards. It's a grim emblem of Alvah Kirk's obscurity that the government
  for which he died could never quite get his name right. In these annals,
  it variously appears as Alvie, Alfred, Alva, Oliver, and Abbah. Some of
  the more cautious clerks simply listed him as &quot;A. Kirk.&quot; Most
  of the records merely list him as present in the company or regiment at
  various times, or record the circumstances of his death. Company and regimental
  &quot;descriptive books&quot; depict him as having a light complexion,
  blue eyes, brown hair, and standing 5 feet 7&acute; inches tall. There
  was one last item of interest. Sometime between May 21 and 23, 1862 (according
  to conflicting records), while the regiment was at Acquia Creek, Virginia,
  Alvah Kirk deserted.</P>
  <P>The reason for his absence is unclear. Technically, desertion merely
  means he was not with the company when the roll was called. He may have
  been ill, gone home for the summer, or both. But if nothing else, Alvah's
  timing was impeccable. He was returned to duty on September 20, after an
  absence of four months, having missed all of the battles Barnes described:
  Thoroughfare Gap, Second Bull Run, South Mountain, and (by three days)
  Antietam. An 1878 War Department &quot;Notation&quot; states: &quot;Records
  furnish no evidence of trial or order restoring him to duty...&quot;</P>
  <P>Another document in this second batch of files is a &quot;Record of
  Death and Interment,&quot; giving the usual data: name, regiment and company;
  residence (Poughkeepsie), and &quot;conjugal condition&quot; (married);
  cause of death (&quot;amputation of left leg&quot;); date of burial (June
  1). At the bottom, under the heading &quot;memoranda,&quot; the clerk entered:</P>
  <P>Effects -</P>
  <P>1 Pocket-Book 1 comb one army medal with name & rank Cash .05 cents</P>
  <P>Several months later, I received a third and final group of documents
  from the National Archives, described as the complete file on Kirk, and
  dating from 1864 to 1872. This batch included Mariah's application for
  a widow's pension in 1864, some related depositions, and guardianship papers
  enabling her to collect additional allowances for the children. (She was
  granted a pension of $8 per month, plus $2 per month for each child until
  they reached age sixteen.) From these documents I gleaned a few further
  details. Mariah was herself illiterate, having signed the papers with &quot;her
  mark.&quot; Most of them were witnessed by Messrs. William Hewlett and
  David Halsted. Halsted had been mentioned in several of Alvah's letters;
  on June 10, 1863, he had written: &quot;I want you to see David S. Halsted
  and tell him to sell the double barrel gun and the stone hammers and give
  the money to you...&quot; Later in the same letter he added: &quot;You
  must tell Mr. and Mrs. Halsted for me that I send my best respect to both
  of them...&quot; From this I surmised that the Halsteds were Alvah's employers.</P>
  <P>To qualify for her full pension as legal guardian of the children, Mariah
  had asked Hewlett and Halsted to attest to her marriage to Alvah, &quot;by
  evidence of cohabitation.&quot; According to the depositions, she had no
  record of the marriage, no recollection of the name or address of the officiating
  minister, and no records of the births of George and Annie. Her deposition
  of October, 1864, claims that she and Alvah were married in February 1858
  -- the year before the death of his first wife, Sarah Hicks, according
  to the census records. It further maintains that at the time of their wedding,
  she was an entire stranger in Poughkeepsie, where said marriage was solemnized
  - that in the company of Alvah Kirk she came from New Hackensack, N.Y.
  then her residence to Poughkeepsie aforesaid immediately upon her arrival,
  they enquired for a minister and was directed...[to] a house near where
  such enquiry was made, that they immediately called at said house and requested
  said minister to marry them, that in pursuance of said request said minister
  duly solemnized the marriage...that immediately thereafter [they] left
  Poughkeepsie and deposed was not at Poughkeepsie again until about the
  time of the enlistment of said Alvah Kirk; that deponent did not hear the
  name of said minister mentioned...</P>
  <P>Mariah also affirmed that there were no other witnesses to the wedding;
  that her children had not been baptized; and that she had checked the marriage
  registers of every church in Poughkeepsie and found no record of hers.
  Two women, Ann Smith and Rosetta Beneway (of the Beneway or Benoway family
  with whom the Kirks shared their house) made their marks to affirm that
  they had been present at the births of George and Annie, and that Alvah
  had no other children by any previous marriage.</P>
  <P>A few other odd details emerge from these documents. In one of them,
  Alvah is listed erroneously as having died at &quot;Coal Harbor&quot;;
  the battle, Cold Harbor, actually took place several days after his burial.
  Mariah's last name is listed on one pension claim as Kelly, and then changed
  to Fitzpatrick; she was probably born Mariah Kelly in 1829, perhaps the
  same year as Alvah, and married to someone named Fitzpatrick in the 1850s.
  In 1872 she was married a third time, to Robert Siren of Poughkeepsie.
  His age was given as twenty-four, and hers as thirty-four, which is obviously
  incorrect.</P>
  <P>In the records vault of the Dutchess County Surrogate's Court in Poughkeepsie,
  I located an affidavit signed by Mariah's children, Annie Axtmann, George
  Kirk, and Thomas Fitzpatrick. It indicates that Mariah died in Poughkeepsie
  in August 1909; Annie Axtmann administered her estate. Thomas now lived
  in Rensselaer, New York, and George in Paterson, New Jersey. Annie remained
  near her mother in Poughkeepsie. At the time of her death, Mariah's real
  property was valued at $2,000.00. Various debts were paid off by the estate:
  for doctors, an undertaker, St. Peter's Church for funeral services, and
  $200 to her son-in-law, Adolf Axtmann, &quot;for board, care and maintenance
  of the deceased.&quot;</P>
  <P>I visited Arlington National Cemetery on a crisp November morning. It
  is an impressive and beautiful place, but remarkably impersonal. As the
  supreme American shrine, evoking the most painful part of our national
  experience, Arlington strikes a visitor as a somber abstraction: a place
  to mourn or respect the dead, but not to find them. More than 200,000 graves
  blanket the meadows sloping down to the Potomac from the stately Custis-Lee
  mansion. It took me nearly forty-five minutes to find the one I was looking
  for, on a knoll at the outer perimeter of the cemetery near the Ord-Weitzel
  Gate. It lay in a row of Union soldiers killed in the Wilderness Campaign
  of May-June 1864. The stark headstone reads:</P>
  <P>Alvah Kirk Co K 95 Regt NY INFMay 30 1864</P>
  <P>Apart from a certain sense of relief and completion, I felt little emotion
  at Alvah Kirk's graveside. There was no mystic link to the spot or to the
  mortal remains beneath it. In fact, I felt a surprising and almost embarrassing
  emptiness. My feelings about Kirk were not those of love or loss that a
  grave might elicit. Despite the name on it, the simple granite slab seemed
  anonymous, blending in with the thousands of nearly identical others to
  form a huge reminder of America's war dead. I scratched away some mud and
  twigs clinging to the lettering, pulled up a few tufts of grass that were
  covering the bottom line, and took some pictures. I didn't stay long.</P>
  <P>In 1991, on the recommendation of Herb Saltford, the Poughkeepsie City
  Historian, I showed Alvah Kirk's letters to Larry Hughes, a columnist at
  the Poughkeepsie Journal and host of a local radio talk show. Hughes wrote
  two columns about the letters. On the very day the first column appeared,
  he called to tell me that he had been contacted by a seventy-seven-year-old
  widow named Vivian Doerr, who claimed to be a descendant of Alvah Kirk.
  Moreover, Mrs. Doerr had said that she too had letters from Kirk. I spoke
  with her by phone for half an hour that afternoon, and we agreed to meet
  three days later. Larry Hughes was so surprised by the development that
  at first he questioned whether Mrs. Doerr was &quot;legitimate.&quot; But
  any doubts were dispelled when she mentioned a reference by Kirk to having
  a bottle of brandy ready when he came home from the war. I remembered a
  similar reference; a computer search for the word 'brandy' quickly located
  it in my file of Kirk letters.</P>
  <P>Mrs. Doerr lived in Poughkeepsie with her cousin, Naomi Leggett, who
  was seventy-eight, in a house that Naomi had been born in, and which had
  once belonged to their grandmother, Annie Kirk Axtmann. (Naomi Leggett's
  mother had been Mabel Axtmann Leggett; Vivian Doerr's father had been Adolf
  Axtmann, Jr.) They had in their possession about a half-dozen letters and
  some fragments, which had been kept by Mabel Leggett and then by Naomi
  Leggett. Mrs. Doerr said she hadn't even been aware of these letters until
  &quot;about twenty years ago.&quot;</P>
  <P>I spent a long, rainy afternoon with Vivian Doerr and Naomi Leggett
  in their modest home near downtown Poughkeepsie. They were friendly, vivacious
  women; both painted and wrote light verse. (&quot;We call ourselves 'Arsenic
  and Old Lace,'&quot; Mrs. Doerr joked.) She showed me some of her paintings,
  which were better than amateur; we then spent an hour going over the family
  tree. Vivian and Naomi knew of no other Kirk heirs, but several lines of
  descent were unclear, and it was possible there were other descendants.
  Vivian's son Christopher, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, lived
  in Georgia with his German-born wife and had no children.</P>
  <P>The cousins knew little about Alvah Kirk themselves, and had had difficulty
  deciphering his letters, but they were genuinely interested in him. They
  had warm memories of their grandmother, Annie Axtmann, and indirectly of
  Mariah Kirk, whom they described according to family lore as a warm, spirited
  woman, full of stories and Irish charm. Annie, they said, had been very
  close to her mother, who they thought had been born in Ireland. In her
  later years, when living with Annie, Mariah had suffered from what the
  cousins described as Alzheimer's Disease, and tended to wander away from
  home. When I described the uncertain circumstances of her marriage to Alvah,
  and her curious inability to recall or document the place of the wedding,
  Vivian Doerr exclaimed sardonically: &quot;She was married before, so she
  must have known what marriage is!&quot; (In a note to me the following
  week, Vivian added an afterthought: &quot;Naomi and I decided Mariah must
  have been a bit of a bitch in her treatment of Alvah. He seems a very tragic
  figure, not much happiness in his life.&quot;)</P>
  <P>I gave Mss. Doerr and Leggett drafts of this essay, photographs of Kirk's
  grave, and transcripts of the letters in my possession. They hadn't known
  that he was buried at Arlington, that he had deserted, or that Mariah had
  later married Robert Siren. They offered a few details in return: Mariah's
  maiden name was probably Fitzpatrick, and she had married someone named
  Kelley before Alvah (not vice versa); George Kirk, Alvah's other child,
  had remained close to Annie. The cousins remembered him as having been
  a very big man, &quot;full of fun,&quot; who enjoyed dancing, drinking,
  and women. (It wasn't exactly the profile I would have imagined for Alvah
  Kirk's son.) They weren't aware that Alvah had been born in Ludingtonville;
  but Naomi remembered trips to Ludingtonville as a child to visit relatives,
  and trips to Rensselaerville to visit the Fitzpatricks -- Mariah's and
  Tommy's family.</P>
  <P>Vivian Doerr and Naomi Leggett seemed to sense that there was something
  special about our meeting. For my part, I felt a trace of awe to be in
  the presence of direct descendants of Alvah Kirk. But beyond that, I felt
  as if something had been reaffirmed: a belief in the power of memory; a
  sense of history, and especially of family history -- that fundamental
  sequence of human ordeals and events that parallels, and in many ways underlies,
  the great events we read about in history books. It was a small testament
  to the durability and power of the written word in the harshest of circumstances:
  those of a troubled, impoverished, illiterate Union soldier, who was otherwise
  no more than a faded family memory, a stone slab at Arlington, and a statistic
  of American history.</P>
  <P>In addition, a long and fragile circle had been closed with the reuniting
  of the two sets of letters. My intent had been to eventually donate my
  sixteen letters to an historical society. When I learned of Vivian Doerr
  and Naomi Leggett's batch, I felt obliged to offer mine to them. They insisted
  instead on entrusting their letters to me -- professing, in fact, to have
  little use for them. It was agreed that I would find a proper home for
  all of the Kirk letters. I took the envelope in which the family's letters
  had been kept for all those years in Mabel Leggett's sideboard, and drove
  home in the pounding rain.</P>
  <P>A few months later, Vivien Doerr told me that she and Naomi had also
  discovered another heirloom: a portrait of Alvah Kirk, which I would be
  welcome to keep with the letters. It was a fine, large pastel drawing,
  probably done over an early photograph -- an early form of &quot;colorizing.&quot;
  (On the back of it is scribbled in pencil: &quot;Mother's father, Alvin
  Kirk.&quot;) Because it is a rendering of Kirk, I regard it with some awe.
  Yet, as confounding as everything else about him, the picture somehow doesn't
  fit the words. The man it depicts, with strong, smooth features and a neat
  goatee, looks more vital, distinguished, and self-possessed than the author
  of the letters to Mariah.</P>
  <P>The envelope given to me by Naomi Leggett and Vivian Doerr contained
  an envelope addressed to Mariah from the U.S. Army pension office in August
  1864; a note from Wells Fargo & Co., regarding a box that had been shipped
  to Alvah and gone astray; five complete letters from Kirk; and six fragments.
  The fragments, with writing on both sides, contained portions of letters
  from Alvah, and a letter from Mariah to the military authorities, soon
  after Gettysburg, inquiring about his safety and whereabouts, which Alvah
  returned with a letter of his own on the back. The newly discovered letters
  matched in style and appearance the batch I had purchased a few years earlier.
  They were in similar condition, and consistent in content and tone, with
  the same leaden greetings, the same stultifying remarks and formal salutations.</P>
  <P>I had known from casual observation that several people had written
  the letters for Kirk; now, a careful scan confirmed that the letters were
  written in at least five distinct scripts. There are between two and seven
  letters in each of the five hands, ranging from fairly elegant to crude,
  and several that I was unable to group, and which are probably isolated
  cases of other amanuenses. They are not sequential, though most of the
  1864 letters are in one hand.</P>
  <P>The frequency of Kirk's letters raises further questions. The twenty-two
  letters I acquired were written over more than two years, but almost a
  year elapses between the earliest-dated one and the next one. Kirk's four-month
  desertion in that period, almost certainly to return home, accounts for
  part of the hiatus. Yet there are five letters from April 1863 alone --
  written as little as three days apart -- and references to others written
  in the same month. Again, at least three letters were written in July 1863,
  but only two survive from the subsequent six months. It is certainly possible
  that Kirk wrote erratically, and his distaste for letter-writing (whether
  due to awkwardness with words, the inhibiting effect of dictation, or his
  relationship to Mariah) is obvious. Nevertheless, it seems likely that
  he wrote many, perhaps dozens, of other letters that are lost.</P>
  <P>The new letters from Vivian Doerr and Naomi Leggett did bring a few
  odd facts to light. An early one (1862), addressed not to Mariah but to
  David Halsted, seemed to confirm my hypothesis that Kirk was employed by
  Halsted in some menial capacity. The same letter states: &quot;I had left
  Sing Sing before your letter arrived and it was forwarded on to me.&quot;
  It occurred to me that Kirk might have been an inmate at the state prison
  known as Sing Sing. But it is almost certain that he was just stationed
  there temporarily, as Company K was partly recruited there, as well as
  in Carmel, Peekskill, and White Plains, before going to New York City to
  become part of the Ninety-fifth.</P>
  <P>In another letter, Alvah writes to Mariah: &quot;Let me know when you
  have seen my daughter Josephine whether she is in Poughkeepsie or not...&quot;
  So the mysterious Josephine of an earlier letter, whose &quot;likeness&quot;
  Alvah had requested from Mariah, was his daughter -- perhaps by Sarah Hicks.
  Yet in all his letters he only mentions her twice, and her very existence
  seems to contradict Mariah's later depositions.</P>
  <P>The Doerr/Leggett letters, then, did nothing to lift the shroud of mystery
  and puzzlement surrounding my encounter with Alvah Kirk. Why was Josephine
  living apart, and with whom? Why did Alvah not know of her whereabouts?
  Why did he not even know for certain where Mariah was living in Poughkeepsie?
  (One phrase continues to haunt me more than any: &quot;Let me know if you
  live in the same place as you did when I come away.&quot;) Why did he desert
  in 1862? Why do the census records show him marrying Mariah a year before
  the death of Sarah? What was the true nature of their relationship? Alvah
  Kirk seemed determined to leave me confounded and tantalized.</P>
  <P>Finally, there is the question of Kirk's fierce hold on my imagination.
  He seems, in the end, a metaphor for the extravagant claims that history
  makes upon us: for the paradoxical futility and urgency of reaching into
  the past, grasping for something tangible that we can hold, know, or see
  -- for the need not just to remember, but also to connect. Kirk's letters
  are one such fragile bridge across time; the ragged record of an ordinary
  man caught up in America's greatest cataclysm. They remind us of what small
  particles make up history's dust. Why Alvah Kirk? Because I stumbled across
  his unintended legacy of words in a Connecticut meadow, not far from where
  he and his ancestors lived. Why the Civil War? Because it remains the salient
  event of our history, the crucible of our Constitutional system and our
  very culture; because that bloody struggle over rights, race, and the nature
  of the Union doesn't simply haunt the nation's conscience. It is our conscience.</P>
