                Elected <br>
                a Fellow of the
                American Association for the 
                Advancement of Science</h2>
                <p>Upton, NY &#8211; Thomas Kirk, Associate 
                Laboratory Director for High Energy and Nuclear Physics at the 
                U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Brookhaven National Laboratory, has 
                been elected a Fellow of the American Association for the 
                Advancement of Science (AAAS). AAAS is the world&#8217;s largest 
                federation of scientists, with almost 140,000 members and 272 
                affiliated organizations from 130 countries, serving a total of 
                10 million individuals.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2003/CN6-260-98_KIRK.jpg">
                <img border="0" src="kirk-w3.jpg" width="153" height="264" align="right"></a>Kirk was one of 348 members elected as 
                Fellows by their peers in 2003. The Fellows were chosen because 
                of their efforts to advance science or foster applications that 
                are deemed scientifically or socially distinguished. New Fellows 
                will be presented with an official certificate and a gold and 
                blue rosette pin on February 14, at the 2004 AAAS annual meeting 
                in Seattle, Washington.</p>
                <p>Kirk&#8217;s citation reads: &#8220;For innovative 
                research in particle and nuclear physics across a wide range, 
                for leadership in developing new accelerator facilities and 
                detectors, and for excellence in research administration.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;I am pleased and honored to receive this 
                acknowledgement of my performance,&#8221; Kirk said.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a 
                rewarding career in physics, and, with many new projects on the 
                horizon, I anticipate more interesting challenges in the 
                future.&#8221;</p>
                <p>Responsible for an annual budget of $190 
                million, and a staff of about 800, Kirk oversees Brookhaven&#8217;s 
                Collider-Accelerator Department, Physics Department, Center for Accelerator 
                Physics, Instrumentation Division, Superconducting Magnet 
                Division, and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider-Alternating 
                Gradient Synchrotron Users Office. </p>
                <p>Under Kirk&#8217;s 
                direction, Brookhaven develops and maintains large facilities 
                that are used by scientists from around the world.&nbsp; These 
                facilities include Brookhaven&#8217;s newest accelerator, the 
                Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC); the Alternating Gradient 
                Synchrotron (AGS), an accelerator used for three Nobel Prizes in 
                physics; the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, where research on 
                the biological effects on ionizing radiation in space is carried 
                out; the Tandem Van de Graff, which is used by commercial 
                agencies to test the effects of heavy ions on integrated 
                circuits and other devices; and the Brookhaven Linac Isotope 
                Producer, which produces radioisotopes for both medical uses and 
                physics research. </p>
                <p>Kirk is also 
                involved in initiating and/or promoting numerous high energy and 
                nuclear physics-related projects for the future. For instance, 
                improvements to RHIC are already in the research and development 
                phase, and the QCDOC-based BNL Lattice Gauge Facility will make 
                possible advanced calculations to solve physics problems with 
                the installation of a 10-teraflop supercomputer at Brookhaven.</p>
                <p>Kirk earned a 
                B.S. in engineering physics from the University of Colorado in 
                1962 and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Washington in 
                1967. He first came to Brookhaven in 1965 while working on his 
                thesis. After earning his doctorate, he continued working on 
                high-energy physics research at Brookhaven as a member of the 
                Harvard University staff. In 1972, Kirk became an associate 
                professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana, and, 
                in 1977, he joined Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and 
                then Argonne National Laboratory in 1989. Kirk was also involved 
                in the design of the Superconducting Super Collider&#8217;s (SSC) 
                solenoidal detector and was co-spokesperson for the associated 
                worldwide physics collaboration. He served as Deputy Director of 
                the SSC Laboratory for closeout of the SSC Project.</p>
                <p>Kirk joined Brookhaven in 1994 in his current position. He also 
                serves as Brookhaven&#8217;s program director for the Laboratory&#8217;s 
                accelerator and detector participation in the Large Hadron 
                Collider at CERN, the European physics laboratory. From 1980 to 
                present, Kirk has been an advisor and consultant for the U.S. 
                Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation on 
                numerous physics topics.&nbsp; He became a Fellow of the American 
                Physical Society in 1989, and, in 2003, he was given the George 
                Norlin Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of 
                Colorado.</p>
