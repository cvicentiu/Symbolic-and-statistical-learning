Thomas Kirk was born in Halifax (Yorkshire) in November 1863 and
came to South Africa in about 1893.  He was a miller by profession
and eventually became the manager of the <I>Buffalo Milling
Company </I>.  He defeated Samuel Larter  in Ward 2 in the Council
elections of February 1910.  He was re-elected unopposed in
February 1913 but his seat fell vacant in March 1914 after he had
had a stroke which paralysed him.  Kirk died on 2 December 1919
at the age of 56, and was buried at East London.
