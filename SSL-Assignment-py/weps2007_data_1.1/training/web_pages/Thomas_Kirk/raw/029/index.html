<p>Transcribed by J.L. McKenzie. Words/comments in [brackets] were inserted by me for clarification. This Margery was the wife of Thomas Nichols who was the brother of my 6th great grandfather, John Nichols. Interestingly, in spite of Thomas's wishes, stated in his <a href="http://www.jadecat.com/famdocs/tnicholswill.html">will</a>,  Margery wrote left her entire estate to her brother, her sister and their children, save for $50.00 to Isaiah Nichols, son of her husband's nephew, Thomas Nichols.</p>
