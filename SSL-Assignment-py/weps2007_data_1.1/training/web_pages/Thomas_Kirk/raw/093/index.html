Sergeant Thomas Kirk, a york county Police Officer, was appointed to the York County
Police Force in 1920 and was stationed in Newmarket during the 1930's.  He was a respected
member of the community and friend to all the area's town folk.  The following is an
account of his death as reported by A. Wallace in <u>The York County Constabulary:</u><br><br>

"about two o'clock on the morning of April 17th Kirk, accompanied by Constables W.M. Shadwick
and R. Hull, was driving south on Yonge Street.  About one mile north of Thornhill his car was 
sideswiped by a north-bound car and went out of control, going over the radial tracks, stricking
a post and turning over several times.  The occupants were thrown out.  Kirk's body was picked
up about sixty-five-feet from the crash with a neck broken and being terribly disfigured.  By
whim of fortune the only damage to the other car was a flat tire and a smashed rear mudguard.<br><br>

Sergeant Kirk was laid to rest on the 19th of April 1930.  His funeral was one of the most 
impressive in Newmarket's history.  Over one hundred cars formed the funeral cortege.  A large
number of uniform officers and two hundred members of the Tuscan Masonic Lodge attended the
service.  Unfortunately Constables Hull and Shadwick were still to badly shaken to attend.<br><br>

As a direct result of Sergeant Kirk's death, the County Warden and Commissioners reported to the 
Council that they believed that Constables should be insured under the Workmen's Compensation
Board Act or some form of insurance protection.  By December of the same year, each Constable was
insured for $2000.<br><br>
