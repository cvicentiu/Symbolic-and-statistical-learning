<p>		"A writ of mandamus will not issue unless three elements coexist--(1) a clear
legal right in the petitioner to the relief sought; (2) a legal duty on the part of respondent to
do the thing which the petitioner seeks to compel; and (3) the absence of another adequate
remedy."  Syl. pt. 2, <u>State ex rel. Kucera v. City of Wheeling</u>, 153 W. Va. 538, 170 S.E.2d

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Per Curiam:

<p>		This Court has consolidated two actions before it because both concern the
payment of a judgment to certain state police officers for unpaid  overtime which this Court
addressed in <u>Gribben v. Kirk</u>, ___ W. Va. ___, 466 S.E.2d 147 (1995) (in order to avoid
confusion we will refer to the prior case as <u>Gribben I</u> and to the two actions now before us
as <u>Gribben II</u>).  In the first action now before us, Colonel Thomas Kirk, the Superintendent
of the Division of Public Safety, appeals the January 24, 1996 order of the Circuit Court of
Kanawha County which ordered, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, Col. Kirk, Glen B. Gainer, Jr., the Auditor of the
State of West Virginia, and Larrie Bailey, the Treasurer of the State of West Virginia, to pay
the judgment in the <u>Gribben I</u> case on or before January 31, 1996.  In the second action Col.
Kirk seeks a writ of mandamus in order to compel the State Auditor and State Treasurer to
<strong>not</strong> pay the $1,508,847.13 judgment in <u>Gribben I</u> out of the account of the Division of Public
Safety.<a href="23292.htm#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  For reasons explained below, we issue a writ of mandamus, and we reverse the
January 24, 1996 order and remand the case to the circuit court.

<p><center>I</center>


<p>		As we explained in <u>Gribben I</u>, the <u>Gribben</u> case represents the third group of
present and former state police officers who filed actions in order to collect unpaid back
wages for overtime.  The other two groups were <u>Adams, et al. v. Mooney</u>, Civil Action No.
Misc.-77-342 and <u>Cordle, et al. v. Kirk</u>, Civil Action No. 83 P. Misc. 622.  We found that
the <u>Cordle</u> case bore an important relationship to <u>Gribben I</u>. 

<p>		In <u>Cordle</u> the circuit court, by an order dated December 31, 1988, "found the
exemption in W. Va. Code, 15-2-5, of State Police Troopers from the overtime pay provision
of the West Virginia Wage and Hour Law, W. Va. Code, 21-5C-1, <u>et seq</u>., 'is
unconstitutional in that it denies equal protection under the laws as required by the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and it violates the prohibition
against passage of special legislation found in Article 6, Section 39 of the West Virginia
Constitution.'" <u>Gribben I</u> at ___, 466 S.E.2d at 150 (footnote omitted).  Therefore, the circuit
court awarded the <u>Cordle</u> petitioners back wages for the time frame from October 13, 1983
to June 30, 1985.  None of the parties appealed the circuit court's decision in <u>Cordle</u>.   

<p>		Thereafter, the <u>Gribben</u> group filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the
circuit court claiming that they were covered by the <u>Cordle</u> decision because they had been
"coerced and mislead into 'opting out' of the <u>Cordle</u> litigation." <u>Gribben I</u>, ___ W. Va. at
___, 466 S.E.2d at 151.  The circuit court agreed with the <u>Gribben </u>group and stated that they
were entitled to the same relief as the <u>Cordle</u> class.  Thus, the circuit court entered a
December 29, 1994 order and a March 17, 1995 order which issued writs of mandamus
against the Auditor and Treasurer directing the Auditor to pay the back pay claims together
with interest accrued from December 31, 1988, by warrants drawn upon the State Treasury. 
The orders also directed the Treasurer to endorse the checks drawn upon the warrants.  We
affirmed the circuit court's orders in <u>Gribben I</u>.  

<p>		Subsequently, the circuit court entered an order on January 24, 1996, requiring
the Auditor to pay the $1,508,847.13 back overtime pay judgment in <u>Gribben I</u> by January
31, 1996. 

<p>		Col. Kirk filed the two actions now before us and a motion for a stay of the
January 24, 1996 order<a href="23292.htm#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> after the Auditor informed the circuit court at the January 23, 1996
hearing that the only way he could comply with the provisions of the order would be to take
the funds from the personal services and unclassified appropriations in the 1995-1996 budget
of the Division of Public Safety.  Col. Kirk maintains that if the judgment had been paid
from the 1995-1996 budget of the Division of Public Safety, then the state police would have
run out of money by April of 1996 requiring the state police to suspend operations for the
balance of the fiscal year. 

<p>		Col. Kirk points out that in the past the courts have not ordered the Auditor to
pay any portion of the state trooper's back overtime pay awards directly from the current
fiscal year budget of the Division of Public Safety.  Instead, all prior payments have come
from appropriations provided by the legislature for that purpose.  The January 24, 1996 order
requires the payment to be made even though no appropriation was yet available for such
purpose.

<p>		Below is a chart compiled from figures supplied by Col. Kirk which explains
what the legislature has paid to date in all of the police back overtime wage cases and what
amount the legislature may still be obligated to pay:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Thus, as of January 1996 the State stills owes approximately $4,970,331.76 on the police
back pay awards.  

<p>		The legislature, being aware of the amount still owed on the police back pay
awards, passed H.B. 4844 on March 9, 1996, to be effective from the date of passage, to
address the obligation.  <u>See</u> Enr. H.B. 4844, Reg. Session, 72nd Legislature (1996).  The
legislature stated in H.B. 4844 that the judgments in <u>Gribben I</u>, <u>Cordle</u>, and <u>Adams</u> were
"moral obligations of the state".  <u>Id</u>.   Furthermore, the legislature appropriated
$2,000,000.00 in the 1996-97 budget to go towards paying the police back pay judgments,
and stated that "an appropriate schedule for payment of the moral obligation declared herein
would be an appropriation of two million dollars per fiscal year until the moral obligation
has been satisfied." <u>Id</u>.  Additionally, the legislature stated the following regarding the
interest in H.B. 4844:

<p>			The Legislature finds that the above amounts do not
include payments for interest accrued after the twentieth day of
January, one thousand nine hundred ninety-six.  The Legislature
finds that it is under no obligation to pay amounts for interest
which may have heretofore or may hereafter accrue.  The
Legislature declares that it may toll the running on interest or
choose to pay no interest on the judgment in its discretion.

<p> 

<p><center>II</center>


<p>		The three issues raised by Col. Kirk are:  (1)  Whether this Court should issue
a writ of mandamus directing the Auditor to not pay the award mandated to be paid in the
January 24, 1996 order of the circuit court from the 1995-1996 budget (specifically from the
personal services and unclassified appropriation accounts) of the Division of Public Safety;
(2) Whether the January 24, 1996 order violates the separation of powers provision of <u>W.
Va. Const</u>. art. V,  1; and (3)  Whether the January 24, 1996 order violates the provisions
of <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. X,  3 requiring that state funds only be expended for the purpose for
which a valid appropriation has been made.  Col. Kirk does not like the manner in which the
January 24, 1996 order mandates that payment be made on the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment.   More
specifically, the Auditor and Treasurer have made clear that absent a specific appropriation
for the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment by the legislature, the only place they may take the money is from
the account of the Division of Public Safety.<a href="23292.htm#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>   As we previously stated, Col. Kirk maintains
that if the judgment was paid from the 1995-1996 budget of the Division of Public Safety,
then the state police would have run out of money by April of 1996, requiring the state police
to suspend operations for the balance of the fiscal year.  

<p>		Col. Kirk maintains that because the legislature only appropriated funds to the
Division of Public Safety for expenses incurred during the 1995-1996 year, it did not include
an appropriation for the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment.  Thus, Col. Kirk argues that paying the <u>Gribben
I</u> judgment out of the 1995-1996 fiscal year budget of the Division of Public Safety violates
<u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. X,  3, which requires that state funds be expended only for the purpose
for which a valid appropriation has been made.  Col. Kirk further asserts that the circuit
court's mandate that the Auditor and Treasurer pay the <u>Gribben I</u>  judgment by January 31,
1996, violates the separation of powers provision found in <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. V,  1 in that
the circuit court is telling the legislature how to appropriate money.  Because Col. Kirk raises
some valid  concerns, we now clarify our holding in <u>Gribben I</u>.

<p>		In <u>Gribben I</u> this Court acknowledged that the history of this case is convoluted
and unusual.  However, we concluded in <u>Gribben I</u> that the obligation before us is a valid
one which arises by valid enactments of the legislature.  More specifically, we found that we
were bound by the <u>Cordle</u> decision which held that certain police officers were entitled to
overtime pay pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 21-5C-1, <u>et seq</u>., the West Virginia Wage and Hour
Law.  Moreover, we found that the <u>Gribben</u>  group was entitled to the payment of interest
pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981].<a href="23292.htm#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  Thus, pursuant to <u>Gribben I</u>, the executive
department and legislature have a duty to discharge the <u>Gribben I</u> obligation.

<p>		We recognize, however, that the power to appropriate money from the treasury
of this State is vested in the legislature subject to specific requirements for executive action
by the Governor pursuant to <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. VI,  51.<a href="23292.htm#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
<p>  The Governor starts the process
by submitting a proposed budget to the legislature for consideration; however, the legislature
actually appropriates the funds.  <u>Id</u>.  <u>See</u>  <u>Board of Education v. Board of Public Works</u>, 144
W. Va. 593, 109 S.E.2d 552 (1959).  Once the legislature appropriates the funds and the
process of executive consideration is completed by the Governor, the Auditor issues a
warrant authorizing the expenditure of the appropriation.  <u>See</u> <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. X,  3.<a href="23292.htm#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
Thus, the executive department and legislature possess flexibility in fashioning a plan to pay
the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment, and this Court will defer to those branches in that most difficult
undertaking.  For this reason, we find the circuit court misconstrued our holding in <u>Gribben
I</u> when it ordered the immediate payment of the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment without giving the
executive department and legislature an opportunity to address the manner in which this legal
obligation shall be discharged.

<p>		Since these actions now before us were filed by Col. Kirk, the legislature
passed H.B. 4844 addressing the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment.  Our review of H.B. 4844 indicates
that in two respects the legislature has not addressed the payment of this obligation in a
manner which fully reflects the duties of the executive department and legislature imposed
by  4 and 5 of art. X, and  51 of art. VI of the <u>West Virginia Constitution</u>.  

<p>		As previously noted, in H. B. 4844 the legislature found that the police back
overtime pay judgments in <u>Gribben I</u>, <u>Cordle</u> and <u>Adams</u> were "moral obligations of the
state."  We disagree with the legislature's characterization of its obligation.  Based on <u>Cordle</u>,
which we determined we were bound by, the underlying claims in <u>Gribben I</u> are valid legal
obligations of the State pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 21-5C-1, <u>et seq</u>., the West Virginia Wage
and Hour Law, which cannot now be avoided or ignored.   <u>See</u> 16A Am. Jur. 2d
<u>Constitutional Law</u>  670 (1979) (Vested rights may be created by statute and cannot be
taken away without due process).  <u>Cf</u>. <u>Durish v. Texas State Board of Insurance</u>, 817 S.W.2d
764 (Tex. Ct. App. 1991) (Debts owed by insurer to a state were vested and could not be
impaired by a law which was subsequently passed which in effect would apply retroactively
to divest the state of collecting on the debt).  Thus, the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment is more than a
"moral obligation."  It is "a previous liability of the State" under <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. X,  4,<a href="23292.htm#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
which must be discharged in a manner consistent with our Constitution.  <u>See</u> <u>W. Va. Const</u>.
art. VI,  51(3) ("Each budget shall embrace an itemized estimate of the appropriations . .
. for payment and discharge of the principal and interest of any debt of the State created in
conformity with the Constitution, and all laws enacted in pursuance thereof[.]").

<p>		The executive department and legislature have several options available to
them in order to discharge a "previous liability of the State."  For instance, a "previous
liability of the State" may be treated as a debt payable over a period of years.  <u>See</u> <u>W. Va.
Const</u>. art. X,  4, in relevant part  ("[T]he payment of any [previous] liability other than that
for the ordinary expenses of the State, shall be equally distributed over a period of at least
twenty years.").  Another alternative would be to appropriate general revenue to pay the
judgment.  <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. X,  5, in relevant part ("The power of taxation of the
legislature shall extend to provisions for the payment of the state debt, and interest
thereon[.]").<a href="23292.htm#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>   Finally,  the executive department and legislature may choose their own
alternative as long as the alternative does not violate our state Constitution.  <u>See</u> <u>Robertson
v. Hatcher</u>, 148 W. Va. 239, 251, 135 S.E.2d 675, 683 (1964) (The legislature's power is
restricted only by the State and Federal Constitutions).  It is not for this Court to choose
among the alternatives.  However, the legislature's authority to determine how to discharge
the <u>Gribben I</u> obligation does not extend to reclassifying the "previous liability" as a "moral
obligation of the state."

<p>		Additionally, the legislature stated in H.B. 4844 that it is under no obligation
to pay the interest on the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment.  More specifically, the legislature declared that
it could "toll the running on interest or choose to pay no interest on the judgment in its
discretion."  H.B. 4844.  We disagree.

<p>		When the legislature enacted <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981] it did not exempt
the State from paying the interest which might be imposed upon it pursuant to that <u>Code</u>
section.  <u>See</u> n.  4, <u>supra</u>, for text of <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981].  We recognize that the
legislature had the authority to exclude the State from paying such interest if it had chosen
to do so.  <u>See</u> <u>Robertson</u>, 148 W. Va. at 251, 135 S.E.2d at 683 (Because the powers of the
legislature are almost plenary, it can legislate on any subject as long as the state and federal
constitutions are not violated).  However, the legislature did not at the time it enacted and
later amended <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 choose to exclude the State from paying such interest. 
Therefore, because judgment has been entered awarding such interest, the legislature cannot
now arbitrarily pick and choose when the State will pay such interest without violating the
due process clauses found in <u>U. S. Const</u>. amend. XIV and <u>W. Va. Const</u>. art. III,  10.<a href="23292.htm#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>		We acknowledge that "[t]he Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep
away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration."  <u>Landgraf v.
USI Film Products</u>, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1497, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229, 253
(1994).  However, this unmatched power does not allow the legislature to retroactively
change statutes so as to sweep away  vested property rights.  <u>See</u> <u>Van Emmerik v. Janklow</u>, 
454 U.S. 1131, 102 S. Ct. 986, 71 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1982) (White, J.,  dissenting); <u>Forbes
Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners</u>, 258 U.S. 338, 42 S. Ct. 325, 66 L. Ed. 647
(1922) (The due process clause is violated when a state passes a statute which applies
retroactively to make lawful the imposition of tolls which a court had found should be
reimbursed to a steamboat company because the tolls, when paid by the steamboat company,
had been unlawfully imposed);<a href="23292.htm#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> <u>Waters Landing Limited Partnership  v. Montgomery
County</u>, 650 A.2d 712, 718 (Md. Ct. App. 1994) ("An ordinance interferes with vested rights
when it attempts 'retroactively to change legislative policy.'" (citation omitted)).  <u>See</u>
<u>generally</u> 16A Am. Jur. 2d <u>Constitutional Law</u>  667-681 (1979).  <u>Cf</u>. <u>Hughes v.
Washington</u>, 389 U.S. 290, 296-97, 88 S. Ct. 438, 442, 19 L. Ed. 2d 530, 535-36 (1967)
(Stewart, J., concurring) ("[A] State cannot be permitted to defeat the constitutional
prohibition against taking property without due process of law by the simple device of
asserting retroactively that the property it has taken never existed at all.").

<p>		In the case before us, this Court upheld the circuit court's determination that
the <u>Gribben</u> group was entitled to interest pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981].  The
<u>Gribben</u> group's right to the interest became more than a mere expectation when the circuit
court ordered that they were entitled to the interest.  The legislature cannot now change its
legislative policy in order to rid itself of its previous liability.  We emphasize that we are not
substituting our judgment for the legislature's.  Instead, we are merely enforcing what the
legislature has by statute already mandated that a person or persons are entitled to collect
pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981].  Accordingly, the legislative mandate that it is in
its discretion as to whether it will pay the interest on the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment violates the due
process clauses of the <u>U.S. Const</u>. and the <u>W. Va. Const</u>. because the interest is a valid
obligation of the State pursuant to <u>W. Va. Code</u>, 56-6-31 [1981].

<p><center>III</center>


<p>		In conclusion, so that there is no further confusion regarding our <u>Gribben I</u>
opinion, we hereby hold that although the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment, including interest, is, as a
preexisting liability, a valid obligation of this State, this Court accords deference to the
legislature's power to determine how the judgment should be paid.

<p>		This Court has held the following in syllabus point 2 of <u>State ex rel. Kucera
v. City of Wheeling</u>, 153 W. Va. 538, 170 S.E.2d 367 (1969):  "A writ of mandamus will not
issue unless three elements coexist--(1) a clear legal right in the petitioner to the relief
sought; (2) a legal duty on the part of respondent to do the thing which the petitioner seeks
to compel; and (3) the absence of another adequate remedy."  In that Col. Kirk has a clear
legal right to not have the <u>Gribben I</u> judgment paid out of the 1995-1996 budget of the
Division of Public Safety and in that there is no other adequate remedy, we grant a writ of
mandamus compelling the State Auditor and State Treasurer to not pay the <u>Gribben I</u>
judgment out of the 1995-1996 account of the Division of Public Safety.

<p>		Furthermore, we reverse the January 24, 1996 order of the circuit court and
remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The
circuit court should ensure that the State complies with both the mandates of this opinion,
including the payment of interest, and its legislative enactment relating to the appropriation
of two million dollars per fiscal year until the previous liability has been satisfied.

<p>	No. 23292 - Reversed and Remanded.

<p>	No. 23293 - Writ granted.
