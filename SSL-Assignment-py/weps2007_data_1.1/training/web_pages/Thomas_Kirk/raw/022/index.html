Second Month 1688, and died 8th Mo. (October, O.S.) 1705.  Joan, who was the

<center>SECOND GENERATION</center><br>
<p><b>2. Anne Kirk,</b> born in Darby 1688-89, appears to have married Benjamin Peters.<br>
  At Darby Monthly Meeting of Women Friends, 10,1,1708: "Anna Sellers & Katherine 
Rhodes ordered to speak to Anne Kirk concerning a Report of some behaviour of 
hers that Truth's Testimony is against."</p>
<p>12,4,1708: "Also this meeting not being satisfied with what Anne Kirk offered 
on account of clearing her self from the Report she lies under, ordered that
Anne Garrett & Phebe Blunston, Sarah ffearn(sic?) & Katherine Rhodes to Enquire 
of the Reporter and hear them face to face."
<p>1,2,1708-9: "The friends ordered by the last meeting to hear the parties face 
to face Did so and acquainted this meeting that the Reporter stood to what he 
had Reported before them all: which meeting did not find that the said Anne Kirk 
was clear from the Report that was upon her."
<p>2,6,1709: "Likewise it is the Judgmentof this meeting that it is Anne Kirks 
own Business to clear her self from the report that is upon her till which time 
this meeting cannot have unity with her Except she give satisfaction."
<p>It may be that she was guilty of dancing but the record gives no intimation 
of the character of the offence.  She appears to have married Benjamin Peters, 
and they signed as witnesses to the marriage of her sister Mary to John Warner, 
Oct. 20, 1715, next after her mother and step-father.  Benjamin Peters was the 
son of Thomas Peters, a Welshman, of the city of Philadelphia, who died in 1724, 
leaving a wife, Alice, and children. Thomas, Benjamin, Rees, Mary (m. Abraham 
Kite), William, Margaret and Elizabeth.

<p><b>3.Godfrey Kirk</b>, born in Darby 9,27,1690; died in Wrightstown Township,
Bucks County, 1740; married 11,17,1724, at Haverford Meeting to Rachel Ellis, 
born 2,28,1691; daughter of Humphrey Ellis and Jane David, of Haverford Township, 
(now) Delaware County, Pa.  He appears to have owned land near Newtown, Bucks 
County, in 1716, but was of Wrightstown at the time of his marriage.  He probably 
had not kept in very close touch with Friends for some years, and having been 
long absent from the place of his birth his membership there had grown dim.  At 
all events, when about to marry he made application at Wrightstown Meeting, 6,8,1724, 
to be admitted to membership; and on 9,3,1724, "his request hath been considered 
and this meeting accepts him as a member."
<p>He was by trade a mason.  His widow is mentioned, as living, in the will of 
her sister Margaret Ellis, 1754.<br><br>

<p>The will of Godfrey Kirk of Wrightstown, is dated, 8,8,1740: proved Nov. 14, 
1740.  To his son Samuel he gave the plantation at 21: mentions wife Rachel and 
daughters Jane and Sarah, and appoints his brother Isaac and friend Thomas 
Lancaster executors.
<p>It appears by records at Doylestown that he owned land near Newtown as early 
as 1716.  The history of his descendants here given is mainly taken from the 
Fell Genealogy, published 1891.

<p><b>4. John Kirk</b>, born in Darby 1,29,1692; died in Abingdon Township, 
Philadelphia (now Montgomery) County, 8,9,1759, and buried at Abington Meeting; 
married at Abington Meeting 8,17,1722, Sarah Tyson, born 9,12,1698; buried 
6,19,1780; daughter of Rynear Tyson and Mary Roberts of Abington. At Abington 
Monthly Meeting, 1,26,1722, he produced a certificate of membership from Darby 
Meeting.

<p>For some reason no notice appears to have been taken of this marriage by the 
meeting, but on 9Mo.7,1739, "Mary Warner, the wife of John Warner of Blockley 
and Daughter of John Kirk, deceased, appeared at this meeting and gave in a 
paper of condemnation for being married by a priest", which was read and received. 
She also requested a certificate to Haverford Monthly Meeting.  This was granted 
10,5,1739.  It is singular that it should have been said she was married by a 
priest (minister), for the marriage certificate shows to the contrary.

<p><b>7. Elizabeth Kirk</b>, born in Darby 3,9,1696; died 11,8,1774, in Newtown, 
Bucks County, Pa; married 11Mo. 1718, at Darby Meeting, to John Twining, born 
in Eastham, Mass., 1,5,1692-3; died in Newtown 8,21,1775; son of Stephen Twining 
and Abigail Young, of that place. He inherited lands in Newtown from his father, 
and also other lands at Eastham, Mass., the former residence of the family.  In 
his will, dated 3,31,1773, he devised to his son John 50 acres, and to grandson 
Joseph 100 acres, all in Warwick Township.  In 1752 he sold 300 acres for (pound sign)
494, on the north branch of the Neshaminy Creek.

<p>William Twining is found at Yarmouth, Mass., in June, 1641, at which time his 
daughter Isabel was married to Francis Baker. A few years later he removed to 
Eastham, where, in 1652, he married Anna Doane, and his death occurred April 15, 1659.

<p>Beside his daughter Isabel he had a son William Twining, born about 1625, who 
married about 1650, at Eastham, Elizabeth Deane, dau. of Stephen Deane and 
Elizabeth Ring.  A few years before his death, which occurred Nov. 4,1703, he

<p><b>8. Joseph Kirk</b>, born in Darby 7,1,1697; died there 11,16,1773; married 
7Mo.1723, at Darby Meeting, Anne Hood, born 12,22,1702-3; daughter of Samuel 
Hood and Mary Hudson of that township.  He was a tailor by trade but doubtless 
carried on farming to some extant.  In 1764 he was taxed with 86 acres of land 
in Upper Darby, one horse, two cattle and two sheep, but young stock were 
probably not taken into account.  He served in the various township offices, as 
constable, 1723, supervisor, 1726, overseer of the poor, 1736, and fence viewer 
1735 and 1736.

<p>The title to Joseph Kirk's land is thus stated: William Penn gave a patent, 
dated July 30, 1684, to Joshua Fearne for 200 acres. Joshua Fearne, by deed of 
December 12, 1692, conveyed 100 acres to his brother Josiah Fearne, who, on Dec.
27, 1717, conveyed the same to Samuel Garrett, and he in turn conveyed 86 acres 
thereof to Joseph Kirk and Ann his wife, Sept. 5, 1723.</p>

<p><b>10. William Kirk</b>, born in Darby 8,31,1700; died there 3,8,1749; married 
at Darby Meeting, 3 Mo. 1723, to Elizabeth Rhoads, born 7,5,1698; died 6,3,1745; 
daughter of Adam Rhoads (written Rhoads by himself,) and Katherine Blunston, of 
Darby. Second marriage, 4,9,1747, at Haverford Meeting, to Mary Ellis, born 
12,8,1699; daughter of Humphrey Ellis and Jane David, of Haverford. She survived 
her husband.
<p>By the will of his father William Kirk inherited the homestead in Upper Darby, 
containing 150 acres of land. He died intestate and letters of administration on 
his estate were granted June 2,1749, to his son John Kirk.
<p><b>11. Isaac Kirk</b>, born in Darby 2,23,1703; died about 1781; married 10,9,1730, 
at Wrightstown Meeting, Bucks County, Elizabeth Twining, born 4,30,1712; died 1744; 
daughter of Stephen Twining and Margaret Mitchell of Newtown Township. Second 
marriage, 9,4,1746, to Rachel Kinsey, born 10,17,1716; widow of John Kinsey and 
daughter of Joseph Fell and Elizabeth Doyle, of Buckingham Township.
<p>In 1729 Isaac Kirk purchased one hundred acres of land from John Brock, in 
lower Buckingham Township, (the deed says) for 90 (pounds), on which he settled, 
and died there about 1781. From the deed we learn that he was a mason and came 
from Newtown Township to Buckingham. At his death he owned some three hundred 
acres. From Wrightstown Monthly Meeting records we find his name on the business 
committees of the meeting as early as 3Mo.4,1734, and as late as 1Mo.4,1763, when 
he requested to be released from his service as overseer. On a draught of Wrightstown 
graveyard we find the resting place of Isaac and Elizabeth Kirk marked; also 
Isaac Kirk Jr., his son, with many others of this numerous family which are laid 
in this historic place.</font size=3>
