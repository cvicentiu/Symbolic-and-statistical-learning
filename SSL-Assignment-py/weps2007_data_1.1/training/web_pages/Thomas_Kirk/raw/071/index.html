                                <p>When the Enron empire fell, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority had a close brush with corporate death. Enron was a counterparty in an energy deal with the Connecticut-based quasi-public waste management agency, <br>
                                  which lost $26 million per year in the wake 
                                of the infamous financial debacle. However, according to Thomas Kirk, president, a new management team and improved operational practices enabled the company to pull itself back from the edge within three years.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;The losses we incurred impacted 70 towns 
                                  and municipalities across the state, and we were forced to burn up our reserves. We even had to borrow a small amount of money from the state so we could continue service. But we have recovered, and the organization is back to focusing on its primary mission: developing and implementing environmentally sound solutions for solid waste disposal and recycling management,&rdquo; Kirk said.</p>
                                <p><span class="style1">Fresh start</span><br>
                                  As money poured out of the hole Enron gouged into CRRA, distrust grew. The legislature, the attorney general, and federal and state law enforcement agencies were constantly investigating CRRA&rsquo;s dealings with Enron, and although, after four years, those investigations have been inconclusive, the agency&rsquo;s board members were replaced with individuals chosen by the state&rsquo;s legislature and a new management team was put in place.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;There was, and to some extent still is, animosity toward the organization as a quasi-public agency of the state, and although it was difficult to endure, we were able to get a fresh start in terms of management and were given the opportunity to redeem ourselves,&rdquo; said Kirk, who joined the company in January of 2003. &ldquo;We have made tremendous strides to earn back our credibility through dramatic changes in corporate 
                                  governance, openness, transparency, improved 
                                  customer service, and communication.&rdquo;</p>
                                <p>For CRRA to earn back its credibility, it had to make some serious improvements to customer service, the first and foremost being its visibility. &ldquo;Most of our customer had never seen us. The only knowledge they had of us was an address they sent checks to,&rdquo; Kirk said. To that end, CRRA made it a point to meet each of its customers and keep them updated on the company&rsquo;s progress. &ldquo;Those meetings were enormously well received. Just showing up was a surprise to them because the company had never done that before.&rdquo; </p>
                                <p><span class="style1">Simple changes</span><br>
                                  Kirk said that despite the turmoil and uncertainty employees faced every day, many stayed with the company. &ldquo;The company had an unmistakable aura of depression around it. Employees came to work every day and read about another investigation that was being launched against the company they work for.&rdquo; To reinvigorate CRRA&rsquo;s atmosphere, the management team made an effort to introduce themselves to all of the employees and engage in conversation to learn what ideas they had to improve the <br>
                                  company.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;We felt it was important they saw a new management team actively working to do things differently. There was no question that many of the existing employees did not share the values and the priorities of the previous administration, so in talking to them, we were able to determine pretty quickly what their issues were,&rdquo; Kirk said.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;We found them to be an enormous resource. My sense is they had not been given the opportunity to participate in the activities of the company in a meaningful way. They were instrumental in providing us direction and pinpointing opportunities to make improvements.&rdquo;</p>
                                <p>Kirk and his team found that one barrier preventing the employees from providing quality customer service was the lack of technology. Simple investments, such as upgraded cell phones to enable enforcement officers to communicate with each other and software programs to manage data and track trends, were all the company needed to get back on track. </p>
                                <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t need complicated programs or machinery. We just needed a way for folks to share information quickly. Now, instead of waiting until the end of the month for certain results, we get them immediately,&rdquo; he said, noting that the company tied its satellite transfer stations into its mainframe servers so employees in the field can access all the information available to them in their office. &ldquo;These things were common 10 years ago, but the company wasn&rsquo;t always dedicated to staying up to date.&rdquo;</p>
                                <p><span class="style1">Out of the public&rsquo;s eye</span><br>
            Now that the storm has passed, CRRA is back to its core mission of providing for the future of solid waste disposal and recycling in Connecticut by developing trash-to-energy programs, increased capacity, and education. </p>
                                <p>CRRA&rsquo;s four solid-waste projects serve 118 towns and cities: the Bridgeport Project, the Mid-Connecticut Project, the Southeast Project, and the Wallingford Project. The Bridgeport Project consists of a 2,250 ton-per-day trash-to-energy facility, eight transfer stations, two landfills, a regional recycling center, and the Children&rsquo;s Garbage Museum, which teaches children how to reduce, recycle, and reuse trash. </p>
                                <p>The Mid-Connecticut project located in Hartford houses a 2,850 ton-per-day trash-to-energy facility, four transfer stations, a landfill, another recycling center and the Trash Museum (More than 50,000 people visit CRRA&rsquo;s two museums each year.) The Bridgeport Project, Southeast Project and Wallingford Project plants use mass-burn technology, meaning that non-combustible materials and recyclable metals are not separated from waste before <br>
                                  processing. All four projects have been able to maintain reduced disposal fees in recent years. Some tip fees skyrocketed, especially after Enron&rsquo;s collapse, but the company&rsquo;s efforts and recent growth have driven prices back down. </p>
                                <p>&ldquo;In terms of the Mid-Connecticut Project, the fiscal turnaround is a tribute to the regional cooperation among the member towns and CRRA. Our joint strategy consisted of refinancing project debt, favorably setting long-term litigation over the project&rsquo;s energy contract, and closing the 
                                  project&rsquo;s aging local ash landfill,&rdquo; Kirk said. </p>
                                <p>The goal he said, is to renegotiate contracts 
                                  and continue developing these projects, as well as new technology, plants, and landfills, while not generating negative press. &ldquo;The citizens of Connecticut somewhat lost interest in us when we stopped appearing in the newspaper, and that is a good thing. We want them to haul their garbage out to the side walk, have it disappear, and never have to think about it again.&rdquo;</p>
