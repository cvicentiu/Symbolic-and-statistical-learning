<IMG SRC="kirk.jpg" height=507 width=390 ALIGN=RIGHT alt="Picture of Norman Thomas Kirk">NORMAN THOMAS KIRK was born on 3 January 1888, in Rising Sun, Maryland.
He graduated from Tome School, Port Deposit, Maryland, in 1906, and received
his Medical Doctor degree from the University of Maryland in 1910. He served
as resident physician at the University Hospital, Baltimore, and as clinical
assistant at the United States Soldiers' Home Hospital, Washington, DC,
before being commissioned as first lieutenant in the Medical Reserve Corps
on 29 May 1912. After a short period of active service, Kirk was appointed
to the Regular Army as first lieutenant, Medical Corps, on 22 May 1913.
<p>His first service was at the Soldiers' Home, Washington, DC, in June
1912. In September he enrolled in the Army Medical School, Washington,
DC, and following graduation, was stationed at Field Hospital No. 3, Texas
City, Texas, from June 1913 to July 1915. For seven months of the period,
Field Hospital No. 3 was stationed at Vera Cruz, Mexico, as part of the
Punitive Expedition. Kirk was then assigned to the Cantonment Hospital,
2d Division, Galveston, Texas, as operating surgeon.
<p>That same month, July, he went to Fort Grant, Panama Canal Zone, for
a brief tour of duty, after which he was transferred to Fort Sherman, Panama
Canal Zone, in October 1915. He stayed there until transferred to the United
States for duty at the Base Hospital, Brownsville, Texas, in July 1916.
<p>In September 1917, he was assigned to the Medical Officers' Training
Camp at Camp Greenleaf (Fort Oglethorpe), Georgia, serving there until
January 1919, when he was ordered to Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington,
DC, for surgical service. At Walter Reed in 1919, he transferred his practice
from general surgery to bone and joint surgery. He was credited with treating
at least one third of the major amputations incurred in World War I. He
was acknowledged as one of the leading experts in the United States on
amputation, and his major publications confirmed his reputation in both
the military and civilian medical communities.
<p>After brief periods of study at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital,
Baltimore, Maryland, and the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts,
in 1925, he was assigned to the Station Hospital, Fort Sam Houston, Texas
(now Brooke Army Medical Center), in October 1925, as Chief of the Orthopedic
Section and Assistant Chief and Ward Officer, Surgical Service. He became
Chief of Surgical Service in July 1927. In February 1928, he was transferred
to the Sternberg General Hospital, Manila, Philippine Islands, as Chief
of Surgical Service.
<p>Kirk returned to the United States in July 1930 and assigned to Walter
Reed General Hospital, Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, as Chief of
the Orthopedic Section. He entered the Medical Field Service School Carlisle
Barracks, Pennsylvania, in October 1931, and following his graduation from
the Advanced Course, returned to his duties at the Walter Reed General
Hospital.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In July 1934, General Kirk became Chief of Surgical Service at the Station
Hospital, Fort Mills, Philippine Islands, and in February 1935, became
Chief of Surgical Service, Sternberg General Hospital, Philippine Islands.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In July 1936, Kirk was appointed Chief of Surgical Service, Letterman
General hospital, San Francisco, California, serving in that capacity until
January 1941. At that time, Kirk returned to Walter Reed General Hospital,
Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, as Chief of Surgical Service.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When World War II appeared imminent, General Kirk assisted the Supply
Division, Surgeon General's Office, in the revision of the Medical Department
Supply Catalog, thus ensuring that it would include the proper items for
the maximum professional care and treatment of the battle wounded.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Kirk was named Commanding Officer, Percy Jones General Hospital, Battle
Creek, Michigan, in June 1942. Here, under his supervision, the Battle
Creek Sanitarium was converted into a general hospital and its staff (mainly
civilians) selected, organized, and trained. During the war, Percy Jones
General Hospital served as a specialized center for the treatment of amputations,
neurosurgery, deep X-ray therapy, and neurology. This hospital, originally
intended to accommodate 1,750 patients, was expanded and together with
Camp Custer, Michigan, became a hospital center with a maximum patient
load of 12,000.
<p>After a contentious selection process, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
selected Kirk to replace Major General James Magee as The Surgeon General.
He was appointed Surgeon General, United States Army, on 1 June 1943. Under
his guidance as Surgeon General, the U.S. Army in World War II achieved
a record of recovery from wounds and freedom from disease never before
accomplished in history.
<p>For the first time, surgery was taken to the men at the front: 96 out
of every 100 wounded who lived to reach a hospital survived as against
92 in World War I. Mobile hospitals were set up within a few miles of the
front lines and medical aid men went into battle with the troops, administering
to the wounded where they fell. Prompt surgery, aided by penicillin, the
sulfa drugs, whole blood, and blood plasma administered at the front, together
with new and improved surgical techniques was responsible for returning
375,000 of World War II's 598,000 wounded to duty in the theater and an
additional 55,200 to duty in the United States.
<p>Through the Army's preventive medicine program deaths from disease were
reduced to 0.6 man per thousand men per year as against 16.5 in World War
I. Malaria was reduced from hundreds of cases per 11,000 men per year to
less than 50. The dysenteries, which once put entire regiments and armies
out of action, occurred among less than 90 out of every 1,000 men per year
and were readily controlled. During World War I, 38 percent of the men
who contracted meningitis died compared with 4 percent in this war; and
24 percent of those who contracted pneumonia died, compared with only six-tenths
of one percent in this war. Through the development and use of toxoids
and vaccines, fear of tetanus, typhoid, and typhus, became a thing of the
past. No deaths resulted from these diseases among troops inoculated against
them. Not a single case of yellow fever occurred in the Army.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This record was accomplished by a Medical Department that included only
1,200 doctors in the Regular Army Medical Corps at the beginning of the
emergency and reached a peak strength of 47,000 Medical Corps, 15,000 Dental
Corps, 18,700 Medical Administrative Corps, 2,000 Sanitary Corps, 2,000
Veterinary Corps, 61 Pharmacy Corps, 57,000 Nurse Corps, 1,600 Dieticians,
1,300 Physical Therapists, and some 535,000 enlisted personnel trained
for such duties as medical aid men, litter bearers, ambulance drivers,
and technicians. These were the personnel who, under General Kirk's direction,
planned and organized the work of the Army Medical Department and cared
for the largest American Army in history fighting a global war, administering
to the 15,000,000 patients admitted to the 692 hospitals overseas and the
65 general and 13 convalescent hospitals in this country.
