                                  1941-1967. I wanted to have my late brother 
                                  who served aboard the Mispillion with me. He 
                                  served as the Captain's gig coxswain until 
                                  1961 when he ran her aground under Allie J. 
                                  Anchors, BM1 (later BMC). He transferred to 
                                  the Supply division under (___) Nabors. He 
                                  made SK/3 and left the ship in 1962. He died 
                                  in Ventura, CA. He was born Oct 12, 1941 and 
                                  died 16 Oct., 1967. Please remember this 
                                  shipmate and my brother. There were several 
                                  sets of brothers on the Mispillion from

                                  was able to defeat and lead the United States

                                  the bitter winter cold and was only a few 
                                  miles from escape in Canada. However, seeing 
                                  his tribe in dire straits from starvation, 
                                  frostbite and from wounds in previous battles, 
                                  Chief Joseph made his famous proclamation

                                  His tribe was returned to the reservation and 
                                  never again saw their native lands in Oregon.

                                        NOTE FROM THE WEBMASTER: <br>
                                        I was not ever in the service or aboard 
                                        the USS Mispillion. I have been 
                                        designing this website and posting items 
                                        as requested for a while now. When I 
                                        received the photo above, it was 
                                        scratched and faded so I began to touch 
                                        it up a little. As I was doing so, I 
                                        began to cry. Much of this website 
                                        design and work is very hard work. Much 
                                        of it is fun and challenging. Some of it 
                                        is very sad to me. To every one of you 
                                        who served on the USS Mispillion, my hat 
                                        is off to you. May God Bless you all.

                                  will greatly missed. I hope in some way this

                                  The National Weather Service says a tornado 
                                  that killed Arnold Gallenbeck Wednesday night 
                                  was an F-three. That rating is based on the 
                                  Fujita scale which is used to determine the 
                                  strength of a tornado based on wind strength. 
                                  Officials say winds measured between 158 to 
                                  206 miles an hour. As of late this afternoon, 
                                  Arnold's wife Gretchen is in serious condition 
                                  at Madison's UW hospital. She was severely 
                                  injured in the tornado. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Today more than one hundred volunteers helped 
                                  clean up the rubble left in place where their 
                                  home once stood. Volunteers have poured out 
                                  today, combing the fields around the house in 
                                  Markesan, looking for any remnants they can 
                                  find. &quot;He's going to be missed very much,&quot; 
                                  says his dad Arnold Gallenbeck Senior. For the 
                                  senior Gallenbeck, the debris is saturated 
                                  with memories of his son. &quot;Found a lot of 
                                  stuff out there. it's hard to take,&quot; he says. 
                                  And as things are pulled from the rubble, 
                                  crews try to decide what Gretchen Gallenbeck 
                                  would like to keep. <br>
                                  &quot;It's unbelievable how it can scatter over the 
                                  countryside for miles. I live seven miles from 
                                  here and there are ceiling tiles from this 
                                  house in my door yard,&quot; says Duane Vis who 
                                  came out to help. Also among the helpers, 
                                  Arnold's co-workers from the Horicon John 
                                  Deere plant. &quot;Arnie meant a lot to all of us, 
                                  and it's kind of a small thing we can do to 
                                  help the family and remembering Arnie as a 
                                  great guy,&quot; says co-worker Steve Buchholz. 
                                  After all of the personal belongings are 
                                  pulled from the rubble, volunteers are taking 
                                  the wood and anything else that will burn from 
                                  the house and disposing of it. They're taking 
                                  all of the metal and anything that won't burn 
                                  and separating it into a pile for recycling, 
                                  and later they say they'll try to bury pieces 
                                  of the concrete foundation here on the 
                                  property. </font></p>

                                  to let the men that served with Arnie know 
                                  that his wife, Gretchen, is out of the 
                                  hospital and doing much better. She is 
                                  suffering from several fractures in her spine, 
                                  but is in rehab and starting to rebuild her 
                                  life. Gretchen attended our Boy Scout Court of 
                                  Honor on Monday Sept. 27. It was a chance for 
                                  the boys to tell her how much Arnie ment to 
                                  the Troop. Arnie was one of our founders and 
                                  our Committee chairman. &quot;Mr Resourse&quot;, as the 
                                  boys called him, could get anything the boys 
                                  needed and was always there when I needed to 
                                  blow off some steam about some kid, or some 
                                  parent. <br>
                                  The Troop is building a memorial case in our 
                                  scout room that will include Arnie's scout 
                                  shirt, his coffee cup, survival kit, and scout 
                                  ID card. Included in the display will also be 
                                  pictures of Arnie at camp outs as well as a 
                                  hat from the Mispillion that was given to me 
                                  at his funeral by one of you guys. <br>
                                  Thank you very much for your time and prayers 
                                  for his family, including the scouting family 
                                  that he left behind. He was a great friend!<br>

                                  would crawl out over bitterly frozen ground to 
                                  tend to the wounded. While he did this, he was 
                                  exposed to enemy fire. They couldn't dig 
                                  foxholes as the ground was so frozen. The 
                                  tanks had to have fires built under the engine 
                                  to get them started. Oscar was wounded several 
                                  times while tending to the wounded He received 
                                  the Silver Star for his actions. His bravery 
                                  under fire and the fact that he would take a 
                                  bullet for his fellow Marines reflects the 
                                  honor and courage of the Medical Corpsmen that 
                                  serve with Marines. We carry a 45 caliber 
                                  sidearm to be used only in defense of the 
                                  wounded as per the Geneva Conventions. I was a 
                                  striker (someone learning the rate) under 
                                  Oscar aboard the Mighty Mispillion. After I 
                                  left the Mispillion, Iwent to Corps School at 
                                  San Diego. Later, I went to FMF training at 
                                  Camp Pendleton and was assigned to the 1st 
                                  Marines 5th Medical Battalion in Vietnam. 
                                  Oscar was more than a shipmate, he was mentor 
                                  and someone who had courage beyond belief. I 
                                  am proud to have served with him and to have

                                  Volunteers began to fall to left and right 
                                  during the battle at Gaines' Mill, Virginia. 
                                  At a critical moment of the battle when the 
                                  flag was in peril, Brigadier General Daniel 
                                  Adams Butterfield rushed forward to secure the 
                                  flag and encourage the embattled troops to 
                                  renewed valor. For his own valor, General 
                                  Butterfield was awarded the Medal of Honor.<br>
                                  During the Peninsula Campaign of that same 
                                  year, General Butterfield with assistance from 
                                  his bugler Oliver Norton, wrote a song that 
                                  became known as taps. Originally used to 
                                  signal the close of day and time for the 
                                  troops to put out the lights for the night, 
                                  &quot;Taps&quot; became a soldier's salute to his fallen 
                                  comrades. Today it is not only played during 
                                  ceremonies to lower the flag at days end, but 
                                  is used in military funerals as the final 
                                  salute of the living to those who have served 
                                  and passed on &quot;into the night&quot;.</font></p>

                                  National Ensign at Funerals</b></span><br>
                                  A deceased member or veteran of the uniformed 
                                  services, or a public official entitled to a 
                                  military or naval funeral, is entitled to have 
                                  his or her casket covered by the national 
                                  ensign. Originally, the Navy used the union 
                                  jack for this purpose, but in response to a 
                                  campaign by Captain William F. Halsey, father 
                                  of the famous World War II admiral, the use of 
                                  the ensign was adopted in the early 20th 
                                  century. A 5 x 9.5 foot ensign is draped over 
                                  the casket with the blue union over the 
                                  deceased's left shoulder, the side of the 
                                  heart. At one time, an officer's cocked hat or 
                                  uniform cap and sword were placed on top of 
                                  the flag, but the modern custom is that 
                                  nothing is ever placed on the American flag. 
                                  This includes floral tributes of any kind. 
                                  Before the casket is lowered into the grave, 
                                  the flag is removed, ceremonially folded, and 
                                  presented to the next of kin. <br>
                                  In addition, deceased service members of the 
                                  rank of master chief petty officer of the Navy 
                                  and above are entitled to a color party 
                                  carrying the national and Navy flags in the 
                                  funeral procession. </font> </td>
