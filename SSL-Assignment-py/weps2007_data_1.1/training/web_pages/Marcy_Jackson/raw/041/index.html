The volunteers will serve as puppeteers who teach children about social concerns through this educational program which features life-size puppets.  Some of the issues addressed are Bullying, Mental Health and Wellness, and Early Childhood Aggression.  Volunteers will participate in one full-day training and then rehearse for several weeks before performing.  We ask that volunteers give a commitment of one performance per week for a minimum of one year.  Performances take place throughout Montgomery County and volunteers must provide their own transportation.  Kids on the Block is an exciting and fun way to make a difference in the lives of young children throughout Montgomery County.  <br>If interested, please contact Karishma Sheth at the MHA, 301-424-0656, ext. 130, or <a href="mailto:ksheth@mhamc.org">ksheth@mhamc.org</a>.</p> <p> <strong><a href="http://www.mcps.k12.md.us/readingnetwork/">Make a Difference: Volunteer To Tutor a Child in Reading</a></strong><br />There is nothing more rewarding than watching the eyes of a young child light up when she or he discovers the joy of reading.
