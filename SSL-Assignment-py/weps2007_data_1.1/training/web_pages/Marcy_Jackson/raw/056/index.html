                <p><font face="Verdana">I strongly recommend the World Language Center at the Yale
                Bookstore at 77 Broadway Street in New Haven for late elementary schoolers and up. Cecile
                Detre-Cohen is the Director, but the whole staff is generally very helpful. They have a
                wealth of tapes, workbooks, textbooks of all kinds and of a huge number of languages, from
                Latin to Swahili. Their e-mail is <a href="mailto:worldlanguagecenter@snet.net">worldlanguagecenter@snet.net</a>.
                Phone is (203)776-3431. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">I also recommend the Barron's Mastering series. It is geared for
                those who wish to do intense, total immersion (several hours a day), and is definitely
                effective in learning to communicate in the language. The only negative is that it lacks
                written exercises (at least the versions I have), but that can be easily provided from
                other sources.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Verdana">We attend French classes arranged by Alliance Francaise, a
                Francophile non-profit organization. The children's classes are limited to 4 students
                maximum, one of the prime attractions IMHO. Our classes are offered in Southbury. I
                understand the Alliance is also active in New Haven (a large chapter), Greenwich and
                Fairfield, but have no contacts in those areas. Contact for the Southbury area is Marcy

                book is $8.30 US. Videos, CD's, literature, instructional materials are all available

                For example - thermometre - which teaches the basics of temperature. There's also a good
                set about seasons and months of the year. The numbers games for each age group are well
                worth a look. A simple click on &quot;corps humain&quot; gives a basic vocabulary by
