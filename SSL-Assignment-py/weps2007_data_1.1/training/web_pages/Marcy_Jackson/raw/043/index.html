                     item of income you
                     received during the tax year. Income you received from sources within, or that was effectively connected with the conduct

                     the relevant possession must be identified separately from U.S. or foreign source income.

                  <p>Generally, the same rules that apply for determining U.S. source income also apply for determining possession source income.
                     However, there are
                     some important exceptions to these rules. Both the general rules and the exceptions are discussed in this chapter.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The rules for determining possession source income are generally effective for income earned after December 31, 2004. The
                     basis of these rules is
                     the &#8220;<span class="quote">U.S. income rule.</span>&#8221;

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;This rule states that income is not possession source income if, under the rules of Internal Revenue Code sections
                     861-865, it is treated as
                     income:

                           United States.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, dividends paid by a corporation created or organized in a relevant possession will be considered income
                           from sources within that
                           possession. There are additional rules for bona fide residents of a relevant possession who receive dividend income from possession
                           corporations, and
                           who own, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the voting stock of the corporation. For more information, see Temporary
                           Regulations section

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Real property includes land and buildings, and generally anything built on, growing on, or attached to land. The location
                           of the property generally
                           determines the source of income from the sale. For example, if you are a bona fide resident of Guam and sell your home that
                           is located in Guam, the
                           gain on the sale is sourced in Guam. If, however, the home you sold was located in the United States, the gain is U.S. source
                           income. However, for
                           exceptions, see <span class="emphasis"><em>Special rules for gains from disposition of certain property</em></span> on this page.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The term &#8220;<span class="quote">personal property</span>&#8221; refers to property that is not real property, such as machinery, equipment, or furniture. Generally, gain or loss
                           from the sale or other disposition is sourced according to the seller's tax home. If personal property is sold by a bona fide
                           resident of a relevant
                           possession, the gain or loss from the sale is treated as sourced within that possession.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;This rule does not apply to the sale of inventory, intangible property, depreciable personal property, or property
                           sold through a foreign office or
                           fixed place of business. The rules applying to sales of inventory are discussed below. For information on sales of the other
                           types of property

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Your inventory is personal property that is stock in trade or that is held primarily for sale to customers in the
                           ordinary course of your trade or
                           business. The source of income from the sale of inventory depends on whether the inventory was purchased or produced.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Income from the sale of inventory that you purchased is sourced where you sell the property. Generally, this is where
                           title to the property passes
                           to the buyer.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;There are special rules for gains from dispositions of certain investment property (for example, stocks, bonds, debt
                           instruments, diamonds, and
                           gold) owned by a U.S. citizen or resident alien prior to becoming a bona fide resident of a possession. You are subject to
                           these special rules if you
                           meet both of the following conditions.

                                       the relevant possession).

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you meet these conditions, gains from the disposition of this property will not be treated as income from sources
                           within the relevant possession
                           for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, bona fide residents of American Samoa and Puerto Rico, for example,
                           may not exclude the gain
                           on their U.S. tax return. (See chapter 3 for additional information on filing requirements.) With respect to the CNMI, Guam,
                           and the USVI, the gain
                           from the disposition of this property will not meet the requirements for certain tax rules that may allow bona fide residents
                           of those possessions to
                           reduce or obtain a rebate of taxes on income from sources within the relevant possessions.

                                 2003, she moves to Puerto Rico. In 2006, while a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Cheryl sells the Rose Corporation stock
                                 at a gain. For income tax
                                 purposes, this gain is not treated as income from sources within Puerto Rico.

                           The new source rules discussed in the preceding paragraphs supplement, and may apply in conjunction with, an existing special

                           or Guam, and who has
                           gain from the disposition of certain U.S. assets during the 10-year period beginning when you became a bona fide resident.
                           The gain is U.S. source
                           income that generally is subject to U.S. tax if the property is either (1) located in the United States; (2) stock issued
                           by a U.S. corporation or a
                           debt obligation of a U.S. person or of the United States, a state (or political subdivision), or the District of Columbia;
                           or (3) property that has a
                           basis in whole or in part by reference to property described in (1) or (2). See chapter 3 for filing requirements.

                        <p>Marcy Jackson is a bona fide resident of American Samoa. Her business, which she conducts from an office in American Samoa,
                           is developing and
                           selling specialized computer software. A software purchaser will frequently pay Marcy an additional amount to install the
                           software on the purchaser's
                           operating system and to ensure that the software is functioning properly. Marcy installs the software at the purchaser's place
                           of business, which may
                           be in American Samoa, in the United States, or in another country. The income from selling the software is effectively connected

                           Marcy's business in American Samoa, even though the product's destination may be outside the possession. However, the compensation
