<h2>Staff and Organizational Development</h2>

<h3>Institutional Formation</h3>

      <p><b>Formation</b> is a term, chosen by Parker Palmer, which describes 
        a special approach to learning that any of us may employ to learn more 
        about ourselves. Formation concepts are based on two fundamental assumptions: 
        (1) that <i>who we are - </i>the way our identity is formed-influences 
        <i>all that we do,</i> and (2) that a more profound understanding, a formative 
        understanding, of <i>who we are</i> strengthens our capacity to act with 
        wisdom and integrity.</p>
      <p>Formation asks a fundamental question, &quot;What is going on inside 
        me and how does it influence the work I do, the people who work along 
        side me, and those I seek to serve.&quot;<b><i> </i></b>To answer this 
        question, we are invited to explore the thoughts, feelings, values, and 
        spiritual understandings that make us unique. Our learning follows a simple 
        path: alone or with colleagues, we take the time to reflect, explore profound 
        questions and issues, and draw on a rich array of resources and traditions 
        for exploring the inner life. The hope is that we will then apply this 
        learning to the way we live our lives.</p>
      <p><b> Institutional formation</b> incorporates two further assumptions: 
        (1) that our inner, formative lives have outward consequences for the 
        organizations in which we work, and (2) that learning at the formation 
        level<b> </b>has enormous potential to enliven and renew our work together.</p>
      <p>Institutional Formation in the DCCCD  is founded on these guiding concepts 
        as described in our <b>Statement of Purpose. </b>The statement enumerates 
        the unifying themes and skills we hope to stress during this undertaking. 
        The themes are familiar-teaching, learning, leading, serving, and building 
        community-but they take on new meaning and relevance when understood in 
        the context of formation. The specific skills we hope to develop are less 
        familiar in today's fast paced organizations, precisely because they focus 
        on ways to strengthen our inner lives within the context of our work.</p>
      <p>Formation efforts were launched nationally in 1994 with a program Parker 
        Palmer conceived called the Courage to Teach (CTT). This series of eight 
        quarterly retreats, spanning two years, is designed to explore the concepts 
        and disciplines associated with formation. Sponsored by the <a href="http://www.fetzer.org%20" target="_blank">Fetzer 
        Institute</a> and led by Dr. Palmer, the first CTT<b> </b>program exceeded 
        expectations, with the pilot group of 20 experienced Michigan K-12 teachers 
        giving it the highest marks. They believed the two-year retreat process 
        had changed their lives.</p>
      <p>In 1996, the Fetzer Institute continued to test teacher interest with<b> 
        </b>CTT<b> </b>programs in South Carolina, Washington State, Southwest 
        Michigan, and Baltimore. When assessing this second cycle of retreats, 
        national evaluators were similarly impressed with the quality of the learning 
        the teachers reported and with the positive changes they brought back 
        to the schools where they taught. CTT offered profound hope and renewal 
        to those involved. The decision was made to continue to expand<b> </b>these 
        initiatives across the country.</p>
      <p>In 1997, the national Center for Teacher Formation<b> </b>was established 
        to develop, deepen and expand the work with K-12 teachers. Located on 
        Bainbridge Island, Washington, the Center provides information, consultation 
        and program development, and assistance to schools and individuals that 
        wish to start CTT programs. It also oversees an extensive training program 
        for the facilitators who lead these two-year programs. Rick and Marcy 
        Jackson are the co-directors of the Center, and Parker Palmer continues 
        to be a close advisor.<b><font color="#0000ff"> (<a href="http://www.teacherformation.org">www.teacherformation.org</a>),</font></b> 
      <p>About the time the national center was launched, the <b>DCCCD  initiative</b> 
        began. In August 1997, a small group from the Dallas Community Colleges 
        (including the Chancellor and Board Chair), as well as several public 
        school and community leaders, were invited to the Fetzer Institute to 
        learn more about formation and discuss with Dr. Palmer the possibilities 
        of beginning this work in Dallas. The planning retreat was among the first 
        formal attempts to include an institution of higher education in formation 
        work.</p>
     
	  <p>DCCCD  leaders returned genuinely excited about the prospects. They had 
        Dr. Palmer's promise to work with them, matched with a strong sense that 
        formation concepts fit the needs of the institution. A further catalyst 
        came in February, 1998 when Dr. Palmer visited the District - giving the 
        keynote at the Faculty/ Administrative Conference Day, leading an afternoon 
        workshop, and meeting with the Chancellor's Cabinet and Faculty Leadership. 
        The great appeal of his presentations and the power of his then recently 
        published book, <i>The Courage to</i> <i>Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape 
        of a Teacher's Life,</i> considerably broadened the organization's support 
        for formation work</p>
     
	  <p>During winter, 1998, two more important steps were taken. First, a pilot 
        CTT group of DCCCD  faculty (at least one from each college) and teachers 
        from the DeSoto Independent School District began a two-year retreat cycle. 
        At about the same time, six Dallasites started a training and mentoring 
        program sponsored by the Center for Teacher Formation to prepare them 
        to lead formation retreats. Since then, an additional facilitator has 
        been chosen from this area. Both steps were significant. The CTT retreats 
        gave the District its first practical experience with the foundational 
        program of formation, and the facilitator training program increased the 
        number of available staff to lead future CTT retreats.</p>
      
	  <p>In partnership with the Fetzer Institute and the <a href="http://www.league.org/welcome.htm" target="_blank">League 
        for Innovation</a>, the <a href="http://www.league.org/league/projects/formation/index.htm%20">Center 
        for Formation in the Community College</a> (CFCC) was established in Dallas 
        in spring 2001. The CFCC focuses on preparing facilitators for work in 
        community colleges through building awareness of formation, deepening 
        that learning, and sustaining those involved in the work of formation. 
        Sue Jones and Ann Faulkner serve as Co-Directors of the Center; Earlene 
        Bond is the Executive Assistant: 214-860.2674.

		<p> As part of its effort to expand institutional formation, District leaders secured Parker Palmer's commitment to make six visits to the DCCCD . The visits began in October 1999 continued through October 2003. These included presentations at various locations in the DCCCD .</p>
