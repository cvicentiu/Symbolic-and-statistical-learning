The Institute hosted a community retreat at the Whidby Institute on Whidbey Island. Here are a few scenes from the retreat, plus a note from Institute Director Charley Johnston:<P>

this event, leading in the creation of the retreat and arranging for  it  
to
be held on the grounds of the beautiful Chinook Learning Center on Whidbey
island.<P>

<B>Reflections From Charley</B><BR>

When Marcy first proposed the idea of resurrecting the idea of community
retreats, I was very supportive of the thought, but not sure I personally
would attend.  It was to come after a two-day faculty retreat, and I'm not
the world's greatest lover of large groups, especially if I'm expected to 
be
'on stage' much of the time.
<P>

Not only did I find the retreat  a very valuable and timely effort, I
personally had a great time.  The thanks for this goes to the wonderful
warmth and energy that everyone brought, and in particular to the event
planners.  The planners not only put together a beautifully crafted event,
they held it in a way that let me have the joy of being there as just a
participant.
<P>

So thanks to everyone.  And I can honestly say I'm looking forward to the
next retreat, whenever that may be.
<P>

Warmly,
<BR>

CJ
