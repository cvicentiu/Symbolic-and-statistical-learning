    <P>I regularly used a product mad by the Whink Products Company of Eldora,
      a rust stain remover for fabrics. Lately I have not been able to purchase
      the product. Finally I decided to contact the company to locate a store in
      my area that sells the stain remover or to place an order. Is the company
      still in operation, and if yes, how do I contact them? (ed: E-Mail:

    <P>Hi, I was born in Eldora but spent part of my childhood in New
      Providence. Before my family left Iowa for Florida in Nov. 1970, my
      mother,Veronica Gregory, now deceased, had donated a sundial in the
      courtyard. She used to have an antique shop called, The Windy Nook in
      Eldora. I was wondering if the sundial was still there. If I remember
      correctly, it was on the South side of the square. If it is still there
      and there is an enscription on it could someone let me know what it says?
      Thank you in advance for your trouble. Susan Gregory - Ft Lauderdale,

    <P>Hi there, everyone. I went to E-NP high in 1980-81. I really enjoyed it
      very much. Everybody made me feel very welcome there, even considering the
      fact that I was a Quakerdale resident. I dated a favored Eldora daughter,
      Amy Saunders, for six years and generally had a wonderful time. The &quot;feel&quot;
      of the town is still carried with me today out in Boston, where the small
      town experience is just a fond memory. A hearty hello to the Saunders' and

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">I check Eldora.net frequently. It makes my old hometown
      seem closer. I grew up in Eldora and got a terrific education. You can be
      proud of your schools which I have visited when there for reunions. I
      didn't appreciate my teachers as I should have when in school; but I
      certainly did when I went to college. Keep telling the young people what a
      good thing it is to grow up in a small town where people care. <BR> Wayne Blankenship, Jr. - Kenner, Louisiana - email:
