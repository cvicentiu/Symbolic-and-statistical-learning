         <h2>AG COAKLEY ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS TO ADMINISTRATION; EMPHASIZES FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT, HEALTHCARE ISSUES</h2><h3>January 22, 2007</h3><h4>CONTACT: <span class="byline">Emily LaGrassa/Melissa Sherman</span>
    <br>(617) 727-2543 
    </h4> <P><STRONG>BOSTON</STRONG> – Today, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley announced a number of appointments to the Attorney General's Office.&nbsp; In developing her new administration, AG Coakley to date has focused on enhancing the office's information technology capabilities, and establishing a new Healthcare Division to address the many issues relative to access to health care in the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>"One of my top priorities in the Attorney General's Office is to use information technology to improve our ability to communicate with the public and to perform our own work effectively," AG Coakley said.&nbsp; "I also know that health care is an issue of great concern to citizens across the state, and it is my hope that with the establishment of a specialized Health Care Division within the office, we will be better able to address the various issues in this area."</P>
<P>Attorney General Coakley is committed to upgrading the information technology infrastructure in the Attorney General's Office with new software to facilitate better case management and to provide attorneys with the tools they need to best prepare cases and respond to complaints.&nbsp; AG Coakley also plans to focus on enhancing the office's website and internal software systems to streamline the process for citizens to file complaints, as well as for non-profits and other institutions to file necessary reports and documentation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To lead the office's information technology initiatives and enhancements to the office's technology infrastructure, AG Coakley appointed <STRONG>Ron Calabria</STRONG> as Chief Information Officer.&nbsp; Prior to joining the Attorney General's Office, Mr. Calabria spent six years as the Chief Information Officer for the Massachusetts District Attorneys' Association, where he was responsible for technology strategic planning and the successful implementations of a large-scale computer network and common case management application for the eleven District Attorney offices.&nbsp; Ron's career with the Commonwealth began in 1998 in the Information Technology Division where he was responsible for technology and community outreach activities associated with Year 2000 transition.&nbsp; Prior to working for the Commonwealth, Ron held positions in private industry, both at Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM.</P>
<P>AG Coakley has appointed Assistant Attorney General <STRONG>Quentin Palfrey</STRONG> as the Chief of the new Healthcare Division, which will be a part of the Public Protection Bureau.&nbsp; AAG Palfrey joined the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office as a member of the Insurance Division in April 2005.&nbsp; After graduating from Harvard Law School, he clerked for Judge Max Rosenn on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and later joined the firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore in New York as a litigation associate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In late December 2006, Coakley announced the first appointments to her leadership team, including First Assistant Attorney General David Friedman, Deputy First Attorney General Edward Bedrosian, and Chief of Staff Sheila Calkins.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In addition to Calabria and Palfrey, Attorney General Coakley also announced several appointments to other bureaus within the Attorney General's Office:</P>
