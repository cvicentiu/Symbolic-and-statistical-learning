    </h4> <P><STRONG>BOSTON</STRONG> â€“ Today, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley announced a number of appointments to the Attorney General's Office.&nbsp; In developing her new administration, AG Coakley to date has focused on enhancing the office's information technology capabilities, and establishing a new Healthcare Division to address the many issues relative to access to health care in the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>"One of my top priorities in the Attorney General's Office is to use information technology to improve our ability to communicate with the public and to perform our own work effectively," AG Coakley said.&nbsp; "I also know that health care is an issue of great concern to citizens across the state, and it is my hope that with the establishment of a specialized Health Care Division within the office, we will be better able to address the various issues in this area."</P>
<P>Attorney General Coakley is committed to upgrading the information technology infrastructure in the Attorney General's Office with new software to facilitate better case management and to provide attorneys with the tools they need to best prepare cases and respond to complaints.&nbsp; AG Coakley also plans to focus on enhancing the office's website and internal software systems to streamline the process for citizens to file complaints, as well as for non-profits and other institutions to file necessary reports and documentation.&nbsp; </P>

<P>AG Coakley has appointed Assistant Attorney General <STRONG>Quentin Palfrey</STRONG> as the Chief of the new Healthcare Division, which will be a part of the Public Protection Bureau.&nbsp; AAG Palfrey joined the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office as a member of the Insurance Division in April 2005.&nbsp; After graduating from Harvard Law School, he clerked for Judge Max Rosenn on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and later joined the firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore in New York as a litigation associate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In late December 2006, Coakley announced the first appointments to her leadership team, including First Assistant Attorney General David Friedman, Deputy First Attorney General Edward Bedrosian, and Chief of Staff Sheila Calkins.&nbsp;</P>
