		<h2>Zilber helped leave an imprint on Milwaukee</h2><h5>By SARAH CARR<br><a href="mailto:scarr@journalsentinel.com">scarr@journalsentinel.com</a></h5><h5><i>Posted: Oct. 5, 2003</i></h5><p>For Vera Zilber, seemingly little details and questions often carried more heft than big ones.</P><p>She was the master of small but significant touches, according to family and friends - remembering family stories everyone else had forgotten, noticing when someone felt hurt or awkward at a social event.</p>

<p>"She brought out the best in everyone," said her daughter Marcy Jackson. "She certainly brought out the best in my dad."</p>

<p>Zilber, 81, died Thursday, having helped her husband reach the top of the Milwaukee real estate market - and build a good part of Milwaukee on the way.</p>

<p>Joseph Zilber, now 85, started Towne Realty, a real estate empire that built thousands of homes and owns landmark office buildings downtown and around the city, including the Riverside Theatre. It also has developed and bought apartments, condominiums, university and military housing and nursing homes, among other things.</p>

<p>Mike Mervis, a friend and longtime business associate of the Zilbers', said Vera was an active partner in her husband's business and spearheaded several charitable enterprises in recent years, including the creation of a scholarship program at Marquette University and a studio at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's School of Architecture and Urban Planning.</p>

<p>All over the city, the Zilbers left an imprint.</p>

<p>Vera Feldman was born in Decatur, Ill., although her family moved to what is now considered the Washington Heights neighborhood of Milwaukee when she was a young girl. She graduated from Washington High School and then attended Marquette, where she met her husband.</p>

<p>Zilber liked to tell family and friends that she chased Joe for two years until he finally caught her.</p>

<p>"The implication was that she was clearly in control of the chase, and I think all who know her will agree that she was," said Mervis.</p>

<p>The Zilbers married in 1942, shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Joe Zilber left to join the military almost immediately after the wedding. After he returned in 1943 and the war ended in 1945, Zilber realized that building affordable homes throughout the city could be a booming business.</p>

<p>"At this point, most of the south side of Milwaukee was farmland," Mervis said. "They built thousands and thousands of homes on the south and west sides of the city in the '50s, many of them for returning GIs."</p>

<p>Jackson remembers her mother as gentle, with a taste for humor that bordered on the absurd. Zilber had rules for everything, including cooking bagels. And she never forgot a single detail.</p>

<p>"She had an elephant-size memory," her daughter said.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Zilbers lived for part of the year in Milwaukee and part in warmer climates such as Hawaii and Florida.</p>

<p>Zilber is survived by her husband; two daughters, Marcy Jackson and Marilyn Zilber; and two grandchildren, Melissa and Shane Jackson.</p>

<p>Funeral services will be   today at 12:30 p.m. at the Joseph and Vera Zilber Campus of Congregation Emanu-El B'ne Jeshurun, 2020 W. Brown Deer Road, River Hills.</p>
