    Tentative Schedule Fall 2006/Spring 2007 <br />
  Course: SFT001</h3>
    <p align="justify">Driver Education at Montgomery College.   This course
      prepares new student drivers to obtain a Maryland driver's license.
It consists of one 3-hour orientation, ten 3-hour classroom sessions, and three
2-hour in-car sessions, total 14 sessions. Students under 18 are required to
be accompanied by parent(s) at the orientation session. Most classes are held at the
       Gaithersburg Business Training Center, see <a href="http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/maps/">map</a> for
       directions to GBTC and information on public transportation options. GBTC
       is located on <strong>RIDE ON bus route 55</strong> (stop at Summit Ave., walk 2 blocks
       toward City Hall/ Gaithersburg MARC train station) or <strong>RIDE ON
       bus route 54</strong> (stop at Diamond Ave. and walk 3/4 mile east, parallel
       to RR tracks).</p>
	   <p>The
       orientation session is designed to help parents and students become acquainted
       with Montgomery College's
driving school policy, overview of Maryland's Graduated Licensing System program,
and to learn Behind the Wheel schedules with expectations. We highly recommend
that students have a learner's permit for this course so that they may have the
opportunity to practice driving with a parent or mentor between sessions. Please
bring your learners permit, if you have one, or your birth certificate to the
Orientation/first class session. Our Driver Education course meets all MVA requirements.
Our experienced instructors are approved and licensed by the MVA. Maximum class
size is 22. Disability support services should be requested 3 weeks in advance.
Total&nbsp; class
time: 33 classroom hours, plus 6 hours Behind The Wheel (BTW) instruction, for
a total of 39 hours. </p>
    <p>This  schedule is provided for planning purposes only.  Check our <a href="http://mc.symplicitynetworks.com/crs/modules/mcweb/redirect.aspx?subj=drivingsafety">official
