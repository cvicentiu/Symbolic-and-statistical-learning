      acquired an international perspective early as the eldest child in a Navy 
      family; volunteered as an English teacher in a Japanese high school at 15; 
      went on to major in anthropology at George Washington University in Washington, 
      D.C., continuing at UC Berkeley with an MA in linguistics. After finishing 
      her degree she taught in a number of programs at local colleges including 
      University of San Francisco where she met colleagues who later joined together 
      to start the English Center for International Women at Mills in May 1977. 
      <p> In the last twenty years, Marcy has worn every hat at ECIW. Since 1988, 
        she has served as the executive director. In the last twelve years, the 
        budget for ECIW has more than doubled; the mission of the Center has expanded 
        to include Career Advancement for women; and ECIW has become known as 
        an innovative service provider for the Oakland Private Industry Council, 
        an integral part of the English curriculum of half a dozen Japanese Women's 
        Colleges, and an important feeder school for Mills College as well as 
        other colleges and universities across the U.S., and an active member 
        of the Oakland One Stop system and the regional EastBay Works.
