<P><FONT COLOR="#663300"><I>"Most of us become teachersfor reasons of
the heart; we teach because we care deeply about our students and
about some subject. But the demands of teaching and the conditions in
some schools cause too many of us to lose heart as the years go by.
Is it possible to take heart once more so that we can continue to do
what good teachers always do, which is to give heart to our
students?</I></FONT></P>

Exploring the Inner Landscape ofa Teacher's Life</I></FONT></CENTER>

<P>The Courage to Teach is a two-year program of quarterly retreats
for the personal and professional renewal of public school teachers.
The program is especially designed for K- 12 teachers in the public
schools, teachers on whom our society depends for so much but for
whom we provide so little encouragement and support. We focus neither
on teaching techniques nor on the reform of the school; instead we
focus on renewing that which is closest to us, the inner life of the
teacher.</P>

<P>The Lewis &amp; Clark College Courage to Teach group consists of
24 teachers who gather for quarterly retreats over a two year period
in various retreat centers in the northwest. In large-group,
small-group, and solitary settings, "the heart of the teacher" is
explored by making use of stories from our own journeys, reflections
on classroom practice, and insights from poets, story-tellers, and
diverse wisdom traditions. Teachers are invited to speak honestly
about their lives as educators, and to listen and respond to each
other, and to themselves, with encouragement and compassion.</P>

<P>The courage to Teach program was developed by Parker Palmer, Ph.D.
and the Fetzer Institute, piloted in Michigan from 1994-1996, and has
since been successfully sponsored in 6 other states across the
country. The Lewis &amp; Clark facilitators, Jay Casbon, Ruth
Hubbard, Greg Smith, and Caryl Hurtig are trained by Parker Palmer,
and Rick &amp; Marcy Jackson, national coordinators of The Courage to
Teach program.</P>

<P>Because inner work takes time, participants in "The Courage to
Teach" are asked to commit themselves to faithful attendance at eight
retreats of three days each over a twoyear period. In addition,
participants will be offered opportunities between retreats to stay
focused on their own inner growth and in contact with one
another.</P>

<H3>Comments from past participants</H3>

<P>"The most deeply meaningful educational experience I've ever had
is 'The Courage to Teach.' Full of substance, affirmation, and light,
it is life-altering."</P>

<P>"The Courage to Teach revitalizes public education. It helps those
educators who, like most of us, really love what we do. However, over
the years we have been wom down. It gives us the opportunity to go
back to the way we did it. You can't help but revitalize public
education when you have a bank with so much powerful stuff that you
can go to and make a withdrawal."</P>

<P>"I say that it is a program that is incredibly respectftil of the
work of teachers. It provides a space where I can reflect on my work
as a teacher in a space where others are doing the same."</P>

<P>"What the Courage to Teach has done for me is to give "permission"
to bring my work on my inner life into my professional life. That, in
itself, has allowed me to be more authentic in my professional roles.
I think the philosophy of the program goes even further to suggest
that as teachers, we have a responsibility to do this inner
work."</P>
