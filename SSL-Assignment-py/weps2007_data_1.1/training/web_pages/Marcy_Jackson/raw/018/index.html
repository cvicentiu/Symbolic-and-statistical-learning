<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>What Is Lifewriting?</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Autobiographical publishing, like religious publishing, is a growth
<p>industry. Twenty-five years ago, John Grigg, writing in the <i>Sunday
Times</i> (28
<p>February 1962), said: "Autobiography is now as common as adultery, and
hardly
<p>less reprehensible." Since that time the growth has continued and the
disdain
<p>dissipated. The range of autobiography has also increased from the "My
Story"
<p>approach of celebrities (the revelations, as one sage put it, that reveal
nothing
<p>bad about a writer except his memory), to include the vanity press publications
<p>(show-and-tell books, usually designed to be handed down to future generations
of
<p>a family), and the formulaic, fill-in-the-blanks book that is the writing
<p>equivalent of a paint-by-numbers picture.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It is not clear if the current popularity of biographical and
<p>autobiographical books is simply evidence of interest in people, about
who they
<p>are, and what they believe, or a desire for information about others'
achievements
<p>and lifestyles — or even a search for generalizable patterns that might
apply to
<p>one's own life.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There are problems however with the use of the word "autobiography"
applied
<p>to a piece of writing. First, to many, it suggests the idea of a historical
and
<p>factual account of one's life, and second, it establishes the mindset
of a long
<p>work, where the whole life must be told, and told in chronological order.
For
<p>this reason, we advance and adhere to the term "Lifewriting."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lifewriting, as we note in the introduction to our book <i>"Lifewriting:
Self-Exploration through Writing and Life Review,</i> is simply "the putting
down on paper
<p>of memories, experiences and thoughts about one's life or even just
about an
<p>event in that life." We suggest the expanded range of Lifewriting:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>At one level, it is the writing of an
<p>autobiography; at the other, it is the capturing of a
<p>wisp of a memory in three or four lines of prose or
<p>poetry. It may even be the jottings that result from
<p>talking about events from one's life. These
<p>compositions need not be past-oriented — they can be
<p>about the present (something that happens today) or
<p>about the future (our dreams and hopes, possibilities
<p>and opportunities). And, of course, the exploration
<p>need not be bound by facts; it can look at the
<p>emotional history of one's life. Lifewriting in short
<p>can deal with the motivations and reactions to present
<p>living, or with possible, probable, and even fantastic
<p>futures.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In other words, Lifewriting is not that form of</dir>
</dir>
autobiography that Quentin Crisp in his book <i>The Naked Civil</i>
<p><i>Servant </i>defines as an obituary in serial form with the last
<p>installment missing. Or, at least, it need not be. Of course,
<p>there can be historical or factual explanation, but there can
<br>also be philosophical self-analysis — and there is certainly
<p>opportunity for fictional (or poetic or dramatic) self-expression.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The text conceivably could be a source for social studies, or a psychological
self-analysis or a piece of creative writing. Creative writing, with the
idea of its being fiction,
<p>seems at first contrary to what Lifewriting is all about, but the
<p>relationship between autobiography and fiction is not really that
<p>straightforward. Not only might the writer use a fictional event
<p>or person to symbolize or transcend an experience, but he might
<p>create things and people to convey a very real mental and
<p>emotional state. But even in the attempt to be strictly accurate
<p>in a depiction of people and events there are problems. First,
<p>there is the perception as received, accurately or inaccurately,
<p>by the observer at the age and in the environment that existed at
<p>that past time; second, there is the selectivity, or even
<p>editing, of attention and memory within the observer; and third,
<p>there is the viewpoint of the present. As Wilhelm Dilthey says:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Owing to the nature of time I possess the singular
<p>unity of my life only by recollecting its course.
<p>When I do this, a long series of processes then acts in
<p>concert in my memory; not a single one of them is
<p>reproducible by itself. Even in my memory a selection
<p>already takes place . . . . Now that I think back, the
<p>only aspect of what is still reproducible for me that
<p>acquires a place in the unity of my life is what has
<p>significance for my life as I now see it. It is just
<p>through my present view of life that each part of it
<p>that is significant obtains, in the light of this view,
<p>the form in which I view it today.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
And there is a similar artistic selectivity, as Dan Jacobson
<p>makes clear in the foreword to his book of "autobiographies," <i>Time</i>
<p><i>and Time Again:</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>'Life' does not write stories. Events have no regard
<p>for narrative shapeliness. The writing of a story may
<p>often enough begin with the writer's imagination being
<p>seized by a specific person, or incident, or anecdote,
<p>or scene, or idea. But in order to give shape and
<p>meaning to what would otherwise remain a mere fragment,
<p>he has to go on to ask himself . . . a series of
<p>leading questions which inevitably attract previously
<p>unrelated images, fantasies, and emotions . . . . The
<p>form it assumes as a result of this process is
<p>frequently very different from the one originally
<p>envisaged by the writer; the germ from which the story
<p>originated may by then have been lost entirely or
<br>perhaps have become unrecognizable to anyone other than
<p>the author himself.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The fascinating aspect of life review is that the events are</dir>
</dir>
not "found," "seen," "understood," or "known" once and for all.
<p>As J. P. De Waele and R. Harre found in examining the use of
<p>autobiography as a psychological method, discoveries about one
<p>event leads to other discoveries:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Inferences about past events, made by the participant
<p>and the investigator, lead to more remembering and to
<p>accounts which may be used to amend and modify the
<p>earlier constructions, thereby eliciting new memories.
<p>Moreover, the individual's past is not a relic carried
<p>along from early to later periods in the life-course.
<p>Quite the contrary, it is part of the living present,
<p>continuously affected by actual and future concerns.
<p>The individual's past is differentially forgotten and
<p>refused; what is remembered of it is inevitably subject
<p>to continuous modification . . . . Thus, the past not
<p>only makes us, but we also make it by putting pieces
<p>together into a more or less coherent whole.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What lifewriters find then is an inexhaustible mine of</dir>
</dir>
reminiscence, with one rich vein leading to another. And what
<p>started out as a seemingly simple need to share memories, to pass
<p>on stories, to pin a happy or unhappy event on paper, becomes
<p>something much more. As we note in the opening chapter of
<p><i>Lifewriting:</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Quite quickly, for most people — whatever the
<p>reason they start lifewriting — the attempt to recapture
<p>the past becomes not only interesting but also
<p>rewarding as they begin to find certain shape and order
<p>in their lives, as they begin to speculate on what made
<p>them what they are. At the deepest level, they begin
<p>to find patterns and purposes and meaning to life.
<p>Along with this realization many discover that they can
<p>transfer angers and hates and joys to paper — they write
<p>the demons out, settle old scores, come to terms with
<p>old griefs, and by so doing they begin to feel that
<p>they can more easily cope with them. As someone once
<p>said, the paper they write on becomes the blotter to
<p>soak up powerful emotions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The workshop provides the forum for all this to
<p>take place. Even for those who prefer to work
<br>privately at getting words on paper, the workshop
<p>becomes an enabling structure, a place to get the
<p>creative juices going and a place to keep them flowing.
<p>It stimulates not only ideas but also the desire to
<p>write; it helps not only in coping with, and even
<p>conquering, writer's block but also in regulating the
<p>actual writing, by forcing the participants to produce,
<p>and to produce regularly, not just when "inspiration"
<p>comes.
<p>The workshop works because it provides a social
<p>context. It is a place to gather with like-minded
<p>people coming together for similar purposes. It is a
<p>place certainly for "show and tell," of remembrances,
<p>of writings. It demonstrates clearly the value of talk
<p>and questioning and it provides peer assistance through
<p>encouragement and criticism. Above all it involves the
<p>participants in the process of writing and takes their
<p>eyes off a too early concern about product, that is,
<p>about producing the perfect and final piece of writing
<p>right away.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
The lifewritings that follow then are not to be seen simply
<p>as a number of pieces produced in a writing class. These are
<p>products of a spiritual journey, an emotional reconciliation, a
<p>quest for understanding. The process has been the important
<p>consideration in many ways but the product — the piece of writing
<p>— is what freezes things for contemplation and reflection. The
<p>important point is that most of the writers were not skilled
<p>writers to begin with — and the objective of the workshops was not
<p>to teach merely a series of skills but to work on experiences
<p>that had meaning to the participants and that they felt strongly
<p>enough about to communicate to others. The initial description
<p>of our workshop, for instance, said:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Lifewriting combines the cultivation of writing skills
<p>with an active exploration of one's own personal
<p>history. Through the reconstruction of past
<p>experience, important people, places and events come
<p>alive and associated stories become available for
<p>communication and publication.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
However, it should be stressed here that the course is
<p>primarily a <i>writing</i> course; it is not an exercise in historical
<p>reconstruction any more than it is a venture in therapy, although
<p>there may be historical results and therapeutic benefits.
<p>Priscilla Pierre Ebersole, in "A Theoretical Approach to the Use
<p>of Reminiscence," posits many functions of reminiscing in
<p>general:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
It expands one's concept of time,</li>

<li>
it transcends the material world and physical</li>

<p><br>limitations,
<li>
it aids in the development of a philosophy of life,</li>

<li>
it keeps the totality of the person ever present,</li>

<li>
it provides a legacy,</li>

<li>
it preserves a culture,</li>

<li>
it establishes the continuity of human experience,</li>

<li>
it allows for self-actualization through creative</li>

<p><br>expression of the individual's experience,
<li>
it promotes self-understanding,</li>

<li>
it expands consciousness,</li>

<li>
it reinforces coping mechanisms,</li>

<li>
it preserves personal and collective history, and</li>

<li>
it allows for identification of universal themes of</li>
</ol>

<dir>humanity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
As experienced and wide ranging investigators we can testify
<p>to these functions — but most of all we can witness to and rejoice
<p>in some very effective and compelling writing! And this is from
<p>people who are not professional writers. Accordingly, the pieces
<p>should be valued in terms of what they set out to do. Each piece
<p>is not in competition with anything; it is a striving by the
<p>writer to pin something meaningful on paper for the first time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The writings have been arranged in five major categories:
<p>Relationships, Events, Places, Reminiscences, and New
<p>Understandings. The categories are arbitrary and subjective.
<p>Obviously, some of these stories could fit in more than one of
<p>the categories; some might be more appropriately called "Coming
<p>to Terms" or "Exorcising Demons". But the headings are
<p>appropriate rubrics for lifewritings. Surprisingly, categories
<p>that are powerful in Lifewriting programs, such as People or
<p>Portraits (as opposed to relationships with people) and Turning
<p>Points (in life) did not emerge as major themes in these samples.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The first piece, by Hilary Rose, developed from the
<p>contemplation of a collection of sepia photographs and entitled
<p>"Sepia Smiles," is perhaps the only example of People through
<p>evocation of family and friends. It is presented at the end of
<p>this chapter to unlock the door to the lifewritings that follow.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Some of the writings are focussed attempts to recapture a
<p>tiny incident that sticks in the memory and some are powerful
<p>evocations of sad or tragic events. They all demonstrate the
<p>abilities tapped by the processes of Lifewriting.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Sometimes when I look at you, I don't know who you are. Oh, I know your
<p>names but I don't know what's behind your sepia smiles. The happiness,
the joy,
<p>the sadness, the pain of death after death after death. What do you
have to
<p>smile about? What is it you're not telling me--you and you and you--
laughing
<p>baby here, pensive father there, smiling grandfather and not so smiling
<p>grandmother. What secrets have you locked away forever behind this pane
of
<p>glass?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What are you, really? More than just a composite photograph of family
<p>spanning almost a hundred years of Roses--pictures from six different
cities in
<p>two separate countries and across five generations. From that first
wedding
<p>picture taken in Southampton in 1872 to the most recent snapshot of
my brother
<p>Tony, sitting on our 1960 Dodge, probably as late as 1966. A hundred
years of
<p>Roses captured forever on film, held in place by a single pane of glass
and
<p>imprisoned on the wall of my living room.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I hardly know where to begin. I know I can look at you mesmerized,
<p>seemingly for hours on end. First, the colours--all black and white
photographs
<p>but no two the same hue. The most recent shots, of my generation, have
almost a
<p>blue tinge to them. The older ones are mostly sepia, but even here there
are
<p>differences--the range goes from grey to yellow to brown. The portrait
of my
<p>grandmother, age ten, in a photographer's studio in Winnipeg at the
turn of the
<p>century is noticeably pink. So from blue to grey to yellow to pink to
brown-these are the colours of my relatives as they stare at me from my
living room
<p>wall.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is my father looking impish at age five (who would've ever thought
of
<p>Dad as impish?), so impish in fact that my great-grandmother is keeping
a
<p>restraining arm on him. Over there is my brother Chris, age one, looking
angelic
<p>as he's never looked since. Up here, my grandfather is looking wistful
in the
<p>hammock with one of the dogs cradled in his arm on his chest.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here are my great-grandparents on their wedding day in 1872 in Southampton
&ordf; my great-grandfather in his uniform of the 5th Regiment of the Lancers,
rank:
<p>corporal; my great-grandmother in a hoop skirt looking a little less
dour than
<p>she does in subsequent pictures. There she is, five children later,
dressed in
<p>the most marvelous bathing costume, no longer in Southampton but at
Victoria
<p>Beach on the shores of Lake Winnipeg.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Also in uniform (and interestingly enough, also on their wedding day),
are
<p>my parents. My father's uniform cap is an improvement over the pill-box
my
<p>great-grandfather wore. My father's rank is an improvement too: sergeant.
My
<p>mother (in the only picture I have of her) is laughing. Her rank: private.
The
<p>two of them are about to depart on their honeymoon in Jeep No. 100.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is my grandmother holding her first baby--my dead uncle Donald
named
<p>after "his• dead uncle Donald, another man in uniform who is not, unfortunately,
<p>represented here. Down here there's another baby who bears a strong
resemblance
<p>to me, in feature if not in mood. This baby is a happy baby.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What can you tell me? About myself, about who I am, about where I come
<p>from? Sometimes I think that in order to come to terms with my present,
I need
<p>to understand my past. And not just "my• past, but my parents' past
and the past
<p>of my grandparents as well. What can you tell me? What do you have to
teach me
<p>about living and loving and dying? I think you know some of the answers.
I
<p>believe some of the answers are locked away behind this glass barrier
and behind
<p>your sepia smiles. And somehow I think if only I looked long enough,
if only I
<p>stared hard enough, then I could know the answers too.
<br>&nbsp;

<dir><i>Child,</i>
<p><i>I named you Matthew — gift of God.</i>
<p><i>On that October day</i>
<p><i>We two exchanged gifts:</i>
<p><i>I gave you life,</i>
<p><i>You gave mine back infused with wonder.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>I only wish to say,</i>
<p><i>Though my arms cannot hold you</i>
<p><i>From your nightmare shadows,</i>
<p><i>Nor greet your waking to each new day,</i>
<p><i>And though I'm not there to scold you</i>
<p><i>When you wander,</i>
<p><i>Nor to watch with tearful awe</i>
<p><i>The daily blossoming of your being,</i>
<p><i>Just know,</i>
<p><i>Every year, in the candle-lit reflections</i>
<p><i>In your birthday eyes,</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>There is one flame,</i>
<p><i>My love,</i>
<p><i>That never wavers,</i>
<p><i>Never wanes.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Those gifts we exchanged</i>
<p><i>On that October day</i>
<p><i>Bridge all distances.</i>

<dir><b>The First Time</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The first time I saw my mother
<p>cry, I
<p>saw
<p>teartracked cheeks
<p>and carrot peels
<p>curled in the sink
<p>and water from the tap washing
<p>over my mother's hands
<p>washing
<p>over
<p>and over
<p>I saw
<p>water
<p>running and
<p>running
<p>like tears flowing and
<p>flowing
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>we were
<p>moving in water
<p>not breathing
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>in unfamiliar light. My
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>mother turned the tap
<p>off
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>and told me
<p>to set the table.

<p><b>The Two of Us</b>

<p>gether:
<p>lifejacketed
<p>landless
<p>between two shores.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Up front
<p>I listen back:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"those trees ahead --
<p>that's where we're going"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"paddle harder"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"O look! a loon!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>O yes. I follow
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>forward to the trees
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>and see soundless the loon
<p>dive,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>disappear.

<p>All I know...

<br>&nbsp;
<p>is

<center><b>ONE LAST DANCE</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Fran Johnson</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>"I remember dancing to the Dorsey Brothers in Detroit, that was when
I was
<p>stationed in Chatham waiting to be shipped overseas." My father was
telling me
<p>this story. I'd heard it many times before. After Mass nearly every
Sunday for
<p>approximately two years while I was growing up, my father and I would
waltz to
<p>the hits from the 40's on the radio, even though it was the early 60's.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I remember sometimes taking off my shoes and gliding around the living-room
<p>floor on my father's feet. He was an excellent dancer and very easy
to follow.
<p>We presented a strange picture when we danced. He was 6'2" tall, so
at twelve
<p>years of age I had to reach very high to place my hand on his shoulder.
His
<p>shoulders and arms always felt lean and very strong. I recall his large
hands
<p>holding mine; his felt rough from repairing other people's pipes. I
felt special
<p>dancing with him those mornings. I didn't consciously think about the
ritual; I
<p>simply enjoyed dancing with him and listening to his recollections of
World War
<p>II. It must have been a unique time in his life. He was from a small
town in
<p>Alberta and used the war as an opportunity to attend concerts and dances
given by
<p>musical celebrities he had only heard on the radio.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The songs my father and I danced to: String of Pearls, Paper Doll, Body
and
<p>Soul, My Blue Heaven, I knew as well as I knew the popular songs. My
father told
<p>stories of talent. I heard how Gene Krupa's hands moved so quickly when
he
<p>played the drums they were like a blur. Years later on the Ed Sullivan
Show I
<p>saw Gene Krupa perform and my father had been right.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My mind always travelled back to those Sundays whenever I heard a song
from
<p>that era. This was the case one night when, at a friend's house having
dinner, I
<p>heard a portion of a song playing in another room. Something about it
reminded
<p>me of my father and I recounted to my friends the story of the Sunday
waltzes. I
<p>hadn't thought of that incident for quite a while and I was surprised
to have it
<p>unearthed that particular evening. The next evening, in a different
city, my
<p>father died of a heart attack--dancing.

<p><b>THE PHONE CALL</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Judy D. Scott</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I was seventeen at the time. I can remember my mother answering the
phone
<p>in the kitchen. It was a short call but I knew something was wrong by
the strain
<p>in her voice. Going to the kitchen I glanced over just as Mom was hanging
up the
<p>phone. She was pale and obviously shaken.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Who was it?" I asked, suddenly feeling scared.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"It was a member of your father's church. Dad was seen in his office
with
<p>another woman." She began to cry.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"They were...," and before she could finish she collapsed at the table,
<p>overcome by emotion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I wasn't surprised. Unknown to Mom, Dad had tormented my nights for
some
<p>time now. He would come to my room on the pretense of a fatherly goodnight
and
<p>then subject me to incestuous foreplay. God, he revolted me, but I was
so afraid
<p>of him. Mom could never know. This was her husband, a church minister,
an
<p>outstanding community member.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I looked to my mother. "You're so ignorant," I thought to myself. Out
loud
<p>I said, "I'm really sorry."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She looked at me, her eyes full of pain, red and swollen. She suddenly
<p>looked very old. We both knew there would be dreadful consequences.
Awkwardly, I
<p>clutched her to somehow ease her pain but I felt cold and void of emotion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"You've done it, you've finally done it," I thought blankly.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Everyone will see your deception and know your seditious secret. You'll
be kicked out of the church."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the days following, we received many more calls. Some were obscene,
some
<p>threatening, and very quickly a sense of desolation spread through the
household.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dad had a heart attack, Mom was always crying and I left home locking
the
<p>doors forever on my childhood.

I said to my son, "It wasn't until I was grown that I knew it wasn't my
<p>fault."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"When were you grown, Mum? When was that? When did you know? Did you
ever know? If it were me I'd always have that feeling--that little bit
of doubt--I
<p>mean, there's always that chance that maybe it was your fault."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When my grandfather, who we called Papa, died, my grandmother came to
live
<p>with us and she slept in my room. I was so happy to have my grandmother
with us
<p>but I felt guilty that I was the cause of Papa's death.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I was ten and Papa had been sick for years. I remember the eighteen
months
<p>he was in Muirdale Sanitarium for TB and we couldn't get close to him
but stood
<p>on the grass a long distance away waving and blowing kisses. I remember
once
<p>not being able to help myself and running to him as he stood in his
pajamas and
<p>striped robe in the sunlight and throwing my arms around him and his
crying. He
<p>was my favourite person, I never heard him raise his voice or call my
grandma
<p>anything but "dearie." Papa was the most gentle man I ever knew. He
was tall
<p>and thin, had long bony fingers and smelled of Camel cigarettes. I would
climb
<p>onto him in the small front room off the living room of their apartment
and I
<p>could never hug him hard enough.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I knew nothing of death. When I was ten Papa had been in hospital for
a
<p>week or two and one night before I fell asleep I wondered what it would
be like
<p>if he died--what would happen--and I thought and whispered "I hope he
dies so I
<p>can see what happens."
<p>I started crying to myself in bed that I didn't mean it and I prayed
to God
<p>to forgive me and was convinced I was a truly wicked person.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next day around four in the afternoon I watched my mother pace back
and
<p>forth in the kitchen and I said, "Can I make you some tea?" Then the
phone rang
<p>and I knew.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I heard her say, "Yes, yes, yes and yes, thank you for calling."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And I said, "Mom, here's your tea," and she said "Thank you dear but
I don't
<p>think I want any right now. Papa has just passed away."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And I started to cry and she hugged me and said it was better than if
he had
<p>suffered a whole lot and I don't remember her crying but she blew her
nose.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She told me long after that it took her years to cry but I cried enough
for
<p>us both and I thought because I had said those awful words the night
before that
<p>I had made it happen--that I had willed him to die and I wanted to die
and I
<p>couldn't tell anyone or they would have hated me and thought me evil.
And none
<p>of us children could go to the funeral and I didn't get to say goodbye.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It wasn't until I was grown that I knew it wasn't my fault that Papa
died.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But my son who is named for him and so like Papa in his gentle ways,
said,
<p>"Maybe it was."

<p><b>GRANDMA AND HER "PERMANENTS"</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Kathy Feay</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>She stood, little more than five feet tall, a sparrow-like woman with
a
<p>lithe, boyish figure and a still dark head of hair. Her eyes were alert
and
<p>seemed to spark and dance as she moved or talked.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This was my paternal grandmother in the early 1950's. Her life had not
been
<p>an easy one. My grandfather had been killed in action during the first
world war
<p>leaving grandma with three young children.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Grandma turned her large, old, draughty home into a theatrical boarding
<p>house. In those days, the two local theatres had a diet of a weekly
variety show
<p>or a play. From the review theatre came an unending stream of small-time
comics,
<p>frustrated opera singers, wobbly ballerinas, animal trainers and the
like.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Playhouse had a small permanent cast of regulars augmented by the
<p>occasional guest artist.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Grandma's "permanents" were a married couple--The Herbert Evelyn's--the
backbone of the repertory players.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Herbert would be manager, actor and even theatre sweeper. He had the
manner
<p>of the old-time theatrical. Expansive gestures, resounding baritone
voice and
<p>corpulent body. His hair, swiftly departing was licked as best he could
into a
<p>thin cover atop his head.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>His wife, Madam Evelyn, no longer acted as her voice had "gone". She
<p>rasped and wheezed, though occasionally was heard trying vainly to sing
her
<p>scales. Again, as if part of another era, she languished in handkerchief
point
<p>dresses, fading perfume and heavy make-up.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Their world at grandma's was the one large room they rented, with use
of
<p>bathroom. That room was a treasure chest of faded furniture, books,
knick-knacks
<p>and plastic flowers. I thought them such a romantic couple! However
they were
<p>much too busy to befriend a child such as I. Their mystery and allure
were only
<p>increased in my eyes.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Temporary boarders came and went, and through it all grandma sat in
the dark
<p>back living-room reading, chatting and overseeing all.
<p>The rules of the establishment were strict. All guests had to prepare
their
<p>own meals on tiny gas-rings in their rooms. All rooms had to be neatly
<p>maintained and no callers after 10:00 p.m. please!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The visitors book was a joy to behold. All the guests passing through
were
<p>required to sign the book. I remember lots of lyrical verses, promises
to return
<p>and even a paw print.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Another permanent was a shy, Irish girl, not theatrical in any way except
<p>she played the accordion. Her front upstairs room I visited regularly
and noted
<p>her collection of crucifixes and religious memorabilia. Sweet and kind,
she sat
<p>in her haven and told me about her new boyfriend.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Johnny was good-looking, charming and funny, and I was overjoyed when
the
<p>engagement was announced: what an exciting time we had talking about
the wedding.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was not to be. After the trusting Mary had signed all her savings
over
<p>to Johnny to buy a house, he disappeared with everything. Mary was heart-broken,
<p>grandma was philosophical and my dreams of being a brides-maid evaporated
into
<p>thin air.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The last of the permanents was an Italian gentleman called Rico. I knew
<p>little of him except he had come to England to try to make money to
send home.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Rico was the only boarder allowed into Grandma's inner sanctum. They
would
<p>often be seen sipping tea together and I learnt my only Italian from
him, a
<p>phrase which I think meant: "Would you like a cup of tea?" I always
thought he
<p>would marry grandma but he eventually returned to Italy and his wife.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>No wonder grandma's house was a place I escaped to whenever I could.
It was
<p>a wonderland for a child, sometimes scary, dark and old-fashioned, but
lit up by
<p>the laughter, chatter and humour of both the permanents and the temporaries.
The
<p>corridors and corners echoed to music, tantrums and recitations. Grandma
<p>presided like a queen over an empire.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Over the years the permanents moved on--Rico back to Italy, Mary to
marry a
<p>new young man and the Evelyn's to die within months of each other in
their late
<p>seventies.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Grandma retired and bred budgerigars. Also she became a cocktail waitress
<p>at a dubious establishment but that's another story!

<center><b>ON THE WAY TO SURABAYA</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Tiong Lauw</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Indonesian rains are like no other rains, they fall to earth in heavy
sheets
<p>obscuring all. Yonas and I, engaged in serious conversation, were not
<p>consciously aware of the rain, but unconsciously we sensed the danger
in the
<p>torrents pelting the road. My car threw showers of water into the air
as we
<p>drove the narrow road to Surabaya. My fingers tightened on the wheel
as we
<p>spoke of what we would do when we arrived in town. My back and arms
ached with
<p>tension as the heavy pounding of the rain continued. I was exhausted,
both
<p>physically and mentally. We had driven for more than four hours through
the
<p>storm. I listened to Yonas, but my mind wandered to Surabaya and home,
to my
<p>bed, and to sleep and rest. Without thinking, as if motivated by some
<p>unconscious desire to be home, my foot pushed the accelerator harder,
and the car
<p>responded quickly. It seemed as if we were on an earth-bound jet, flying
through
<p>the clouded darkness. I heard Yonas ask me a question, but I could not
answer.
<p>I could not answer because what I saw ahead of us at that moment was
terrifying.
<p>There, coming from the opposite direction, was a truck, and behind the
truck was
<p>a motorcycle, overtaking the truck, passing it, unable to see me in
the rain,
<p>heading directly for me.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In movies, scenes like this are played out in slow motion. On the road
to
<p>Surabaya, I had barely time to hit the brakes, to set my car into a
grinding
<p>skid, before the motorcycle and its two riders slammed into me. I can
still see
<p>them and the motorcycle flying through the clouds of rain, hitting the
asphalt
<p>road. My car, twisting in large circles, finally stopped. And all was
quiet,
<p>save for the rain pounding on the metal roof of my car. Yonas and I
looked at
<p>each other. We opened the doors and ran to the two motorcyclists now
lying on
<p>the road. The motorcycle, mangled beyond recognition, was in a small
ditch at
<p>the side of the road. We ran to the two men.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I stood over the first man, rivers of blood dissolved into the rain.
I
<p>trembled, too shocked to do anything. The sight of blood, the bodies
of the
<p>victims lying helpless in the road, the memory of the horrible sounds
of the
<p>crash, knowing I could have done nothing to avoid the accident, and
my sense of
<p>agony, filled me with a bitter sick feeling.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I noticed that villagers had begun to arrive. They looked at Yonas and
me
<p>with a hostility I have never known before. I could tell they thought
it was our
<p>fault. I tried vainly to explain to them what happened. They didn't
seem to
<p>understand. Anger filled their eyes. One, a young man, picked up a large
stone
<p>and began slamming it on the side of my car. Yonas and I got in and
locked the
<p>doors. The villagers crowded around us. We could feel the car move as
they
<p>pushed forward, trying to get at us. The distant sound of a siren announced
the
<p>arrival of the police and an ambulance.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I will always remember that night. It took me a long time to be able
to sit
<p>behind the wheel of a car without shaking. I was relieved, some time
after the
<p>accident, to hear that the two men were all right. Often, as I fall
asleep at
<p>night, I see myself driving down that road. Each time I dream, I try
to change
<p>it, but I am unable to change what happened. I will always remember
the night,
<p>the rain, and the lives that could have been lost.

<p><b>THE STORM ON INTERSTATE TEN</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Violet Williams McDermot</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the first hours the desert was an enchantress with golden light and
<p>scented breath. She wore a profusion of multi-hued blossoms and shrubs
from
<p>which small birds took flight as we passed. We were charmed by her beauty,
<p>knowing nothing of her vagaries, her hostile moods.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We were travelling by car from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Tucson, Arizona,
a
<p>journey which normally takes about six hours. As we neared the agricultural
<p>inspection station at the state border, the wind came up scattering
debris and
<p>sand about under a threatening sky.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Having a bit of a blow," said my husband to the official on duty. The
man
<p>nodded. "'Tis late for the time of year, though," he added. Pronouncing
the
<p>oranges we carried free of disease and wishing us a good trip, he waved
us off.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Reassured that the weather was nothing to worry about, we drove on.
At
<p>first we were amused by the antics of sagebrush which came leaping,
and rolling
<p>towards us. Some sailed by while others scrambled noisily about under
the car
<p>before breaking free. But we soon found ourselves locked into the grey
world of
<p>a desert sandstorm.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next hours were a nightmare as we crawled in funeral procession
between
<p>two eighteen-wheeled tractor trailers. The red lights were our only
guides. I
<p>was terrified they might crush us. I saw our car as a coffin in which
we lay
<p>entombed under the sand. The wind pushed and shrieked at us, rising
and keening
<p>to an unholy pitch, then subsiding to soft moans like someone tormented.
The air
<p>in the car became heavy, claustrophobic. We hardly spoke for Dee needed
total
<p>concentration to maintain our position between the two trucks. I thought
of our
<p>family back home, and wondered if we would ever see them again. I watched
Dee
<p>straining to see through the gloom while his hands gripped the wheel.
And I felt
<p>useless. As the hours crept by I longed to do something, anything to
break the
<p>tension. We'd eaten nothing since breakfast and the lunch we carried
was out of
<p>reach in the trunk of the car. Then I remembered the oranges, the big
beautiful
<p>oranges lying on the back seat. I carefully peeled, and fed juicy segments
to
<p>Dee, thankful I'd been greedy enough to purchase so many.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly we drove out of the storm into blinding sunlight. We felt
<p>exhausted, but elated like prisoners who'd tunnelled their way out of
prison.
<p>Flinging open the windows we savored the fresh, clean air, and the feeling
of
<p>freedom as we sped towards Tucson. It had taken us eleven hours to do
a six hour
<p>trip.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We escaped with a sand-blasted windshield and license plate; otherwise
we
<p>had nothing to show for those frightening hours. But Death had stalked
our route
<p>that day claiming three lives when a car left the road and rolled over.

<p><b>SCARED IN SWEDEN</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ruth Hasman</b>
<p><br>
<p><i>"Do not read this at night"</i>
<p><i>"Do not read this alone"</i></center>

<p>These warnings stood out boldly on the cover of the book that was handed
to
<p>the teenager.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I'm sorry," said her Swedish 'father.' "It's the only book we have
in
<p>English."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Thank you," she said reluctantly. Having read all the books she'd brought
<p>from home in California, she had no choice.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The teenager was spending the summer with a Swedish family on an island
in
<p>the archipelago off Stockholm. Her Swedish family lived in a hundred
year-old
<p>farmhouse. Not much had changed in the past hundred years. They cooked
and
<p>warmed themselves by a wood-burning stove as they ate and read by their
kerosene
<p>lamps. The only modern convenience was the telephone to the mainland.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She planned to read the book that night. So she said to her family,
"If you
<p>hear any screams tonight, you'll know it's only me."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Good night," her family said before going upstairs to bed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Good night," she said as she went to the guest room off the kitchen.
She
<p>quickly settled under her warm covers to read by the light of the kerosene
lamp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The words were gripping and she couldn't put the book down. She was
so
<p>engrossed in the book that she didn't hear it at first. Slowly the strange
<p>noises penetrated her consciousness. "What was that?" "Oh," she sighed,
"It's
<p>just the wind blowing the branches against my window." Those noises
added to the
<p>tension building in the air. She was scared, but she couldn't put the
book down.
<p><i>Psycho</i> had her in its power!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly the door to her room burst open. She stifled a scream. Her
heart
<p>leaped into her throat. She slammed the book shut while her heart beat
out of
<p>control. She took a deep breath and cautiously got out of bed. She peered
into
<p>the kitchen. No one was about! "Oh! Someone didn't shut the outside
door," she
<p>sighed. She tip-toed through the kitchen and closed the door. With that
accomplished, she crept back to bed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Oh, no," she thought. "I have to go to the bathroom." She did <i>not
</i>relish
<p>the idea of going to the outhouse behind the house. "I just can't wait
any
<p>longer." So, she put on her shoes and grabbed her lantern. She raced
out the
<p>back door glancing from side to side. In fact, she set a new world record
for
<p>the hundred yard dash! She leaped back into bed, blew out the lantern
and pulled
<p>the covers over her head!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The wind was still blowing, the branches were still scraping her window.
I
<p>won't scream, she thought, but . . . I vow I won't:

<center><b>WAR YEARS</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Cobi Raymer</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The official war years for us in the Dutch East Indies ran from the
7th of
<p>December 1941 till the 14th of August 1945. But that did not mean that
our
<p>suffering was over. Far from it, the tragic struggle with the population
<p>started. The Javanese had been exploited by the Japanese during these
war years,
<p>many had been sent to fight for them in a war zone, like New Guinea,
and many had
<p>been killed. The Japanese were hated not only by the Dutch, but certainly
by the
<p>natives of the land.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>From November 1942 till the 15th of September 1945 my mother and I spent
the
<p>years in three different Japanese prison camps. The first one was Sorabaja
along
<p>the Reiniers Blvd., in Darmo. The camp was large, perhaps in excess
of 10,000 as
<p>not only Dutch women and children from that city were interned, but
also people
<p>from the surroundings and from the plantations. One can not forget the
doctors
<p>and dentists, who were of great importance to run our small improvised
hospital
<p>in the camp. Other Dutch men, who were not working for the Japanese
in the
<p>different business offices during the first months after the capitulation,
were
<p>interned in separate camps.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My brother, who was eighteen years old in May, 1942, had been picked
up with
<p>his high school friends and marched off to a camp. They landed in Kesiller,
a
<p>large peninsula on the south-eastern tip of the island of Java, where
they lived
<p>like Robinson Crusoe in the wilderness, using primitive shelters made
of bamboo.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mother and I shared our small house on van Swoll Street No. 7 with ten
more
<p>people. Most of us slept on mattresses perched on top of trucks containing
a few
<p>possessions gathered in haste, before entering the camp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Our camp was controlled by the Japanese navy, who were supposed to be
more
<p>"civilized" than the army. Our camp manager was a naval officer named
Takahasi,
<p>who also supervised our grocery store.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Camp life became routine and we all made the best of it. A mother with
her
<p>ten year old son were living in the front section of the living-room,
an elderly
<p>nurse in the other, separated by curtains. My mother and I were using
the first
<p>bedroom, while a woman and her two daughters occupied the second. In
the garage
<p>lived a woman with two active boys of ten and twelve, while a small
servant room
<p>housed our most cheerful occupant, who was busy in the kitchen each
day, making
<p>delicious fondant in many flavours, which she sold in the store, giving
her
<p>enough income to live on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Towards the closing of the year 1943 rumours spread through the camp
that
<p>soon people would be sent to other camps and also that some of the women
were
<p>going to be used to fill a brothel that the Japanese were preparing
outside the
<p>fence of our camp. We actually could watch them through the woven bamboo
<p>enclosure, which was double-walled with Javanese "Hi-Ho's" (nickname
for
<p>Javanese working in the Japanese Army) keeping guard in between, while
marching
<p>around the camp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One day Takahasi began his check-up of all the women in the camp. When
he
<p>came to our house I was scrubbing the bathroom floor, my chore for that
day,
<p>looking rather dishevelled and sweaty. Each of us had to show our face
and give
<p>our name. We were asked if we worked anywhere in the camp, in the store
maybe
<p>or the hospital. All my answers were negative. Then Takahasi scribbled
in his
<p>little book and left, dragging his sword behind him. We were all puzzled
and
<p>alarmed as the brothel stories were going around with great persistence.
One
<p>woman did get detailed news from outside the "kedek," the fence made
of bamboo.
<p>She had a friend who was a Hungarian citizen and not interned. She planned
to
<p>climb over the fence if she was chosen for the brothel, to escape and
be
<p>sheltered by him.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Early in 1944 the transports to other camps started. The women and children
<p>were hoisted onto trucks and had to sit on the floors. Then they were
taken to
<p>the railway station and pushed into the coaches. With the windows closed,
in
<p>terrible heat, in pitch darkness, with crying children and practically
no
<p>sanitation, with only the food they had brought themselves, they slowly
travelled
<p>through the night with many long stops until they reached, at last,
Semarang, on
<p>the north-coast of Middle Java, in the early morning.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There, several Roman Catholic churches and adjacent schools had been
<p>prepared. South of Semarang more camps had been readied, among others
the
<p>notorious Ambarawa, a fortress that was now a prison.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After nine or ten thousand women and children had left, only about two
<p>hundred remained in the camp, my mother and I included. It was eerie
as the camp
<p>seemed completely empty and very silent.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A couple of days later we were ordered to appear at the main office
in the
<p>camp. This was run by several Dutch ladies, also by some of my girl
friends.
<p>While waiting, some cars arrived and about ten drunken naval officers
entered the
<p>office, where they gathered around an oval table. The women were called
in one
<p>by one. The mothers of some of the women who had been allowed to stay,
to dispel
<p>the rumours, were first told that they had to go on transport. So my
mother had
<p>to leave, and I had to stay. After a couple of hours about a hundred
and fifty
<p>young women had been chosen. It was now noontime and the heat in the
office
<p>became oppressive. The tension grew, the women were very edgy and worried,
while
<p>milling around the office and talking to each other, trying to find
a way out.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A few German women, who lived on the inside periphery of our camp and
who
<p>had daily contact with our oppressors, asked to be allowed to stay in
exchange
<p>for some of the Dutch women. But for some strange reason, none of their
requests
<p>were accepted. With time the turmoil in the office increased, many mothers
were
<p>crying openly. Most of the chosen women for the brothel came from good
families
<p>and some were very young.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I wondered how to get out of this predicament. I felt that my only chance
<p>was to obtain a note from the doctor that I had been sick a few months
earlier
<p>with pleurisy. The Japanese are scared stiff of any contact with persons
who are
<p>not healthy. I was lucky. My doctor was in our building and although
the
<p>medical records had already been sent to Middle Java, she wrote me a
note
<p>informing the reader that I had been sick with lung disease.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>An office friend willingly passed the note to one of the Japanese Officers
<p>and whispered something in his ear. He looked at me in disbelief, and
growled
<p>his impolite "UGH!" I was waved away, I was not accepted, I was free!
I could
<p>not believe my luck! My mother and I ran home, where I stayed on the
divan till
<p>we left a couple of days later on transport. In case we were checked,
I kept a
<p>glass of milk with me and darkened my eyes with mascara to look quite
sick.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Our small transport left towards the evening. The women who had to stay
in
<p>the camp followed us with reproachful eyes. We felt sorry for them,
but on the
<p>other hand we were relieved.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On the train I met my friend who had handed my doctor's slip to one
of the
<p>Japanese. I was still puzzled because it seemed so easy to get away.
She told
<p>me that she had mentioned to the Japanese that I was so ill that I actually
had
<p>to be isolated in the T.B. house in the camp where the serious tuberculosis
cases
<p>had to stay. No wonder the Japanese looked at me with disbelieving eyes
as I
<p>looked the picture of health!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My mother and I were so thankful for my friend's help. We gave her a
tin of
<p>fifty special cigarettes to show our appreciation. It was not much.
I wished I
<p>could have given her more, but this was just one of a few luxuries we
still
<p>carried in our suitcases.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The women who had been kept behind in the camp were released six weeks
<p>later, after they had "cleaned" the houses in the camp. One of the Scandinavian
<p>consuls in Soerabaja had pressured the Japanese to let the women go,
as they were
<p>not treating these prisoners according to the Geneva Convention. Thank
God that
<p>we were under the Japanese navy, for they did listen.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Although these women were sent to different camps in Middle Java, at
least
<p>this dangerous episode was over for all of us.

<p><b>AN AUCTION SALE</b>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>One day my husband took me to an auction sale. This was quite an experience
<p>for a city girl.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As you probably know, they start off with all the old junk from the
barn and
<p>work down to the goodies and interesting items.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>All of a sudden the auctioneer shouted. "I have here over a hundred
<p>beehives, old but still good and a large stainless steel honey extractor.
"Who
<p>will bid $200.00 for all this equipment?" Not a sound was heard. "One
hundred
<p>dollars," he called. Still no replies. "Fifty dollars," he shouted.
Still no
<p>bites. "Twenty-five," he bellowed. "Is no one here interested in raising
bees?"
<p>By this time my husband gave me a knowing look. He knew that I had always
wanted
<p>to raise bees. "Please," the auctioneer shouted again. "Someone bid
something."
<p>Up went my hand. "Five dollars," I called. The auctioneer looked at
me and
<p>said, "Oh lady, how could you?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Home we went with all the bee boxes piled up in the back of our Datsun
truck
<p>and piled them in the barn. When looking them over one day I decided
it was a
<p>lot of hard work to clean them up so in the barn they stayed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One day a visitor spied the bee boxes in the barn and asked my husband
who
<p>they belonged to. "My wife," he said. "Would she sell them?" he asked.
"We'll
<p>go up to the house and ask her." "How much are they worth to you?" I
asked.
<p>"Would you take $75.00?" "Sold," I said, but didn't include the honey
extractor.
<p>That later sold at our auction for $35.00.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>That spring we went to the city and bought new equipment for one hive
and
<p>what an interesting time we had raising bees, and this time I got stung.

<center><b>THE LICH GATE AND THE LIZARD</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Nan Halsey</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Sometimes our subconscious discards reality and can only be jolted into
<p>focus by shock. Here is how it happened.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When my father died our house was sold. The property was bought by a
<p>religious order and black robed monks took over. At times they seemed
like crows
<p>pecking at the empty carcass of our house. And, at other times, they
seemed not
<p>there at all. For the house still stood, warm and familiar, like a beacon
of
<p>love with a promise of open arms.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since the sale was protracted, my brother acted as caretaker. He lived
in
<p>the old gardener's cottage where previously we had kept the tools and
plucked the
<p>chickens. But the cottage had no stove, so he was permitted to use the
<p>facilities of the old house. Often I would visit him and we would sit
in the
<p>large bare kitchen, perched on the edge of boxes like two mournful sparrows,
<p>forks clacking in the resonance of empty space.... And we dreamed of
our
<p>childhood days when the kitchen was the hub of the house.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>He reminded me one day, that it was over twenty years since we had watched
<p>as brick by brick, the house grew out of the yellow clay on the lower
slopes of
<p>the Port Hills. And in that clay, a remnant of a prehistoric past was
found - a
<p>live toatara lizard - and Maoris say that these slow silent lizards
are symbols
<p>of peace and happiness.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>At the lower entrance to the property, my father built a lich gate -
a
<p>covered entrance over the steps leading steeply up from the street.
It was
<p>reminiscent of lich gates at the entrance to the old churchyards of
his ancestors
<p>in far-away Britain, put there as resting places for the carriers of
coffins.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then, under the ever-busy hands of our parents, trees, flowers and shrubs
<p>grew up quickly and the scars of new paths softened under a patina of
fallen
<p>leaves. Contrasts filled the park-like garden - dark with light, shade
with sun,
<p>coolness with warmth. It all harmonised with joy and sorrow. Sorrow,
since
<p>after only one year there, my mother died and father alone brought up
the
<p>children.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Years rushed by and we all grew up and left the nest. But to me, the
house
<p>was always home, breathing our breaths and whispering our fears and
hopes.
<p>was part of my being - and part of my mother. The 'sale' was a paper
blowing in
<p>the wind . . . a cruel joke . . . a worthless gossip.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then, one summer's evening, I was on duty late at the hospital and missed
<p>supper. So I decided to bicycle the four miles "home" and eat with my
brother.
<p>Besides, it was a moonlight night -- almost a full moon and should not
take too
<p>long.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The moon, now and again draped with filmy drifting clouds, rose pearly
white
<p>and luminous above the city, casting silver lights on roofs and windows.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When I arrived at the entrance to the property, the lich gate was in
deep
<p>shadow and looked suddenly sinister and forbidding. Like a tunnel, it
was filled
<p>with shifting shapes, hunched and ominous.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Heart pounding, I entered, fearfully forcing myself to ascend the steps
to
<p>the shrubbery where the gravel path wound upwards to the house. Here
it was a
<p>jungle of strange sights and sounds. Fingered branches clutched at my
dress and
<p>cassocked bushes swayed in the wind. The breeze rustled leaves like
whispering
<p>voices and soughed mournfully amongst the pines.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Exhausted, I reached the familiar brick house, only to find that the
<p>uncurtained windows looked eerily out like the eye sockets of a skull.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Almost running, I hurried past the house, aided by a clearing moon,
and
<p>climbed up to the gardener's cottage and the promise of security. But
the place
<p>was strangely silent. There was no light. I hammered on the door with
my fists.
<p>There was no response. Was my brother in the old house having supper?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Skidding quickly down the slippery gravel path, clinging to branches
on the
<p>way, I rushed to the back door and knocked . . harder and still harder.
It too
<p>was locked and there was no light either in the kitchen.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Faced by this bleakness I was gripped by hunger. Somehow I must get
in and
<p>eat. My ears strained for sounds but the house stood silent and dark.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then, as I stood forlornly outside, the naked moon shone brilliantly
clear,
<p>high-lighting the half-brick edging of the building. And, above, an
open window
<p>winked like an eye in the second story sun-room.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Irresistibly, I was drawn to that brick corner. Stepping behind a big
<p>geranium bush, I felt the rough projections of the edging with my fingers
and
<p>memories of childhood tree climbing returned.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Carefully gripping with fingers and toes, I started up the side of the
<p>house, realizing I could only go upwards since descent would be too
difficult.
<p>Above, by the blackness of the open window, stretched a wide sill upon
which we
<p>often used to lean - but it seemed so very far away. As my grip began
to tire
<p>and weaken, I realized the stupidity of what I was doing. But there
was no going
<p>back. Shakily I reached the sill, and, with an immense effort, grasped
it,
<p>kicked, heaved and finally balanced my body upon it . . half in, half
out.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Clouds raced across the moon leaving shadows of dark and light. Briefly
<p>they illuminated the once friendly room. But what I saw made me limp
with
<p>fright, paralysed with a nameless dread. Three sleeping figures occupied
three
<p>beds placed like the prongs of a fork. The black, monk-like forms seemed
to
<p>breathe deeply together in a celibacy of silence. Strangers! Strangers
who were
<p>men, but not just men. Strangers in the heart of our house.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My stomach ached from being balanced on the sill, but inside I ached
with
<p>fear and guilt that the monks would awake and find me there. Yet messages
were
<p>flashing through my mind like shafts of light from the moon. No longer
did I
<p>belong in this house whose maternal heart was still. No longer did it
breathe or
<p>whisper our hopes. It murmured other prayers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And, in this moment of anguish, a pall of darkness fell as the moon
sank
<p>behind clouds. But it gave me courage. Swinging my body over the sill,
I
<p>tiptoed quietly across the cork floor, past the sleeping figures and
out into the
<p>creaking silence of the house.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Reaching the kitchen, I turned on the light. But strangeness was
<p>everywhere. The kitchen was transformed. Carved chairs and tables, stacked
with
<p>white plates, were placed neatly in rows. An open prayer book lay on
a table.
<p>As I touched a page, the words "Lighten our darkness . . " shone above
my
<p>finger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I hurried to the pantry and ate a sandwich of stale bread. Pretty soon,
my
<p>brother arrived. "How did you get in?" he asked incredulously. I told
him.
<p>Everything.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Don't worry," he said, "It was only the monks' clothing on the beds.
They
<p>are moving in tomorrow. They told me I would no longer be needed, so
tonight I
<p>have found another place to live."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Relief flooded through my mind like warm sunlight. A little later, after
a
<p>satisfying hot supper, I said goodbye to our old home. As my bicycle
wheels spun
<p>away, my thoughts spun too, like unclogged gears oiled by insight. And
my light
<p>shone brightly into the darkness of the night.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Now the monks were welcome to the lich gate - and to the lizard, wherever
it
<p>might be.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The parental heart of the house had ceased to beat.

<center><b>A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Eunice F. Fleming</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Though a thing of beauty is supposed to be a joy forever, it does not
follow
<p>that a joy forever is a thing of beauty. Many years ago when I was raising
my
<p>family, there was something in our house that played a large part in
the
<p>formation of good habits, yet by no stretch of the imagination could
one describe
<p>it as beautiful, or even very interesting. I'm not sure of its shape;
it was
<p>either square or oblong. It was not at all colorful. It had no style.
It was
<p>simply a hole in the wall.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But there it was just outside the bathroom door, and almost directly
above
<p>the washing machine in the basement. The builder said a laundry chute
was an
<p>extra but I didn't care. I would cut corners somewhere else, because
I had a
<p>plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Aside from its one fault of accepting socks in pairs and somehow managing
to
<p>get them divorced before they came upstairs--the laundry chute did not
let me
<p>down. The day we moved in, standing with my back to it, I announced
to the
<p>children: "You are old enough now to have noticed that I have considerable
<p>difficulty keeping my own things in their proper places. I should not
have to
<p>keep track of yours. You each have a nice room with plenty of drawers
and
<p>closets, and since you like to hang things on doorknobs, if you hang
them at all,
<p>I've put five knobs on the walls. I realize you must walk through the
kitchen
<p>or the living-room to get to your own rooms but you must not drop anything
on the
<p>way."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I stepped aside and slid back the panel that covered the hole in the
wall
<p>and went on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"If you do you'll know where to look for it."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Those kids were not slow learners. Probably no more than a dozen trips
to
<p>the basement to search through soiled clothing for hockey pucks, comic
books,
<p>hair ribbons, baseball gloves, roller skate keys, yo-yos, ping pong
paddles, wet
<p>mittens, tennis balls, skipping ropes and other things--and they were
cured.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What joy I experience now when I visit them in their own homes. What
neat
<p>kids I raised. If only my <i>own</i> mother had a laundry chute, perhaps
I would be as
<p>neat as they are.

<p><b>THE SOLITARY SWINGER</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ella Cail Smith</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Near our home is a school with an adjoining playground. There are assorted
<p>attractions for the youngsters - climbing ropes, pulley rides across
a wire, and
<p>the old fashioned swings, always a favourite - to name just a few.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Several evenings as I take a customary walk about the neighbourhood
for
<p>exercise and fresh air, I notice a lone person swinging slowly in the
playground.
<p>With his feet touching the ground he propels himself gently to and fro,
to and
<p>fro. His back is to the street and it's impossible to determine if the
bulky
<p>figure is a man or an overweight boy.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There is no one else near him, ever. I speculate: "Has he no friends?
<p>Could he be handicapped?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Farther away but within his view are some boys kicking a ball about
and
<p>shouting with excitement. Is he watching enviously and longing to join
in the
<p>fun? In the adjacent ball park too are numerous young people playing
soccer or
<p>baseball while exuberant spectators occupy bleachers or lounge on the
grass.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What a pity. He seems to be an outcast from society. Or perhaps he's
a
<p>natural "loner" and deep in thoughts of his own in tune with the soothing
rhythm
<p>of the creaking swing.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Maybe next time I see him swinging so idly I might approach and sit
on a
<p>swing alongside so he won't be all alone? Or would he resent the intrusion?
If
<p>he's a boy he might. If it's a man, my motives could be suspect as I'm
often a
<p>solitary walker, yet not lonely, while my husband busies himself in
our garden.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It might be wiser just to continue my walk while puzzling over the solitary
<p>swinger.

<p><b>A VERY SPECIAL TIME</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Heather Fair</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>I found a pile of clay bricks that had dried in the sun, sat down and
<p>watched the scene below. It was moving, but to where and from what?
The street
<p>was filled to overflow with people on bicycles, carts with heavy wooden
wheels
<p>pulled by oxen, donkeys, men and women. With each drop in temperature
another
<p>layer of clothing had been added to their stooped bodies making movement
a
<p>little more laborious. Dust from the road covered their clothing and
faces.
<p>Their eyes were down-cast. I looked a little to the east and saw two
old men — one sitting on a stone, (taken from the ancient palace during
the revolution?),
<p>the other squatting close beside, sharing a cigarette. Behind me I could
hear
<p>children playing. I turned to see what the squeals of delight could
mean. They
<p>were playing with bricks, like the ones I was sitting on, watched closely
by
<p>their mother. Was that their grandmother I could see inside the courtyard,
<p>grinning proudly at her only grandchild?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Later, on the way to the village, I passed a gang of men and women chiseling
<p>rock from the side of a mountain. They hauled it in wooden carts to
a clearing
<p>farther down the mountain. They put the rock in a huge grinder and took
turns
<p>cranking until the rock became small stones. Then they placed the stones
piece by
<p>piece on the ground making a roadway.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The path into the village was built up and so narrow we had to walk
single
<p>file. We met her at the entrance gate. She carried her baby on one hip
and
<p>didn't return our greeting or smiles. Her eyes were lifeless but penetrating-&ordf;had
she been hurt? By whom or by what? The other villages were friendly and
<p>chatty--anxious to show us a garden, a kitchen, offer a cup of tea.
Even when
<p>grandma hobbled up on her tiny, previously-bound feet, she was still
there, but
<p>kept her distance. This was so unlike anything we had encountered. In
a nation
<p>of one billion people one can not only smell what their neighbour is
having for
<p>dinner but can also hear it sizzle. Looking over a neighbour's shoulder
to see
<p>what is in the wok is not unusual--privacy, if ever known, is forgotten.
On the
<p>way back to the entrance gate we passed more village occupants--chickens
and
<p>cows. We stopped to admire the hand-carved garden tools. She followed
still. We
<p>gathered to say one last goodbye. We walked slowly down the path that
would
<p>eventually take us to the main roadway. I looked back. They waved. She
stood
<p>apart--oh, those eyes. I kept looking back. They were still waving but
I could
<p>no longer see her eyes. The road finally took a turn .
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The roadway began to fill with men and women. Across stooped shoulders
some
<p>carried a shovel or a pick; some, a bamboo pole and with bouncy step
eased the
<p>burden of swinging baskets filled with chips and twigs carefully gathered
and
<p>guarded during the day. They would soon be used to light a fire under
woks to
<p>cook the evening meal. Soon the village would be filled with the distinct
smell
<p>of bok choy. It was plentiful this year.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>What year was this? 1680? 1780? 1880? Finally I feel pulled back. It's
<p>Arleigh, my husband. The year is 1984, our first trip to China and we
have just
<p>arrived back at our hotel in time for the evening meal.

<center><b>AN IRISH WAKE</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Rachel Houghton-Brown</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Although it is close to eighty years ago, I remember as clearly as if
it
<p>were yesterday the day I returned from school and was surprised to find
my home
<p>very much upset. Furniture was moved outside from the kitchen and our
two maids,
<p>Mag Campbell and Mary Darby, their heads tied up in white cloths, were
white-washing the walls. "Why are you white-washing now? Where's mother?"
I knew
<p>that there was something unusual going on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Oh, Acushla, it's bad news there is. Your mother is in the parlour.
<p>She'll tell you."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I hurried to mother and found her arranging flowers in vases. She looked
<p>shocked and unhappy and told me that grandfather had died a few hours
earlier.
<p>Mag had taken him up his tea and found him dead. He had died peacefully
in his
<p>sleep.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Grandfather dead! I wanted to rush upstairs to see him but mother said
no,
<p>I must wait until morning. I was sad and grieved. I could not imagine
our home
<p>without grandfather. Tears flowed and I felt lonely and distressed.
My mind was
<p>in a whirl and I was most puzzled. Why the upset home, why the urgent
sounds of
<p>men working upstairs? It seemed incongruous to me. If grandfather was
at peace
<p>and in Heaven, why all this activity on earth?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mother explained that grandfather's friends and neighbours would come
to his
<p>home to mourn for him and to offer sympathy to his family. There would
be crowds
<p>of people in the house for the next three days. This was called a Wake.
A Wake
<p>lasted three days, she said, because it used to be thought that the
spirit of
<p>the dead stayed around for three days after death.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Feeling out-of-place in this suddenly strange home, I wandered
<p>disconsolately out into the garden where I found my older sister and
brother on
<p>the swing at the end of the lawn. We sat there and spoke in hushed tones
of
<p>grandfather's death and of the bustling activity in our home. He was
our grandfather and we could mourn him without help. We did not want other
people in
<p>our house.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For the rest of the day and all through the night there was a lot of
coming
<p>and going. The doctor came, went upstairs for a few minutes, came down
and
<p>handed my parents a certificate, "Death of Old Age." Orders were sent
to the
<p>village for large supplies of bread, meat, groceries, wine, whisky and
beer. These
<p>were delivered during the night and placed in the little back kitchen.
The large
<p>front kitchen was prepared for company with benches and chairs. The
dining room
<p>table was moved out and rows of chairs were placed against the walls.
The
<p>parlour was dusted, the brasses polished, and vases of flowers were
put
<p>everywhere.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the morning I went to grandfather's room with my sister. Everything
was
<p>changed. Pictures and mirrors were covered with white cloths. The canopy
of the
<p>four poster was draped with a white sheet. Grandfather was dressed in
a white
<p>shroud. He looked serene and lovely with his white hair and beard. The
bed was
<p>covered with white. Beside the bed stood a table on which four large
white
<p>candles were burning. These candles would burn steadily through the
three days
<p>and nights of the Wake. A few dozen white clay pipes were on the table.
Beside
<p>them lay a large plug of tobacco and a container of spills to "redden
the
<p>pipes." When grandfather's men friends came into the room they cut a
pipeful of
<p>tobacco, rumpled it in their hands, filled a pipe and had a smoke with
him,
<p>muttering to each other little words of praise and reminiscences. "He
was a
<p>good-natured and kind man." "He was a rollicking boy in his day." "He
loved a
<p>joke. He'd laugh till the tears come to his eyes." "Ah! We'll miss him."
Then
<p>they would look at grandfather a while in silence and go downstairs.
Another
<p>group would take their turn at smoking and visiting their dead friend.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>During the three days jaunting cars, donkey carts and carriages rumbled
down
<p>the avenue. My brother and Tom and Johnnie, two labourers on my father's
farm,
<p>were kept busy finding places to tie the horses and give them sweet-smelling
<p>Timothy hay. A little park at the back of the house was used for this.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Day and night people came. The underlying idea seemed to be that for
these
<p>three days grandfather must have company at all times. Beautifully dressed
women
<p>with their black bonnets and beaded dolmans were ushered into the parlour
and
<p>given a ritual glass of wine and biscuits. Then they would go upstairs
for a
<p>while, come down and sit for a few hours. The men in the dining room
and kitchen
<p>settled down for the day, enjoying each other's company. They talked
about
<p>everything except their dead friend, the Timothy that was spoiled by
the rain;
<p>the long cold winter, the poor price of cattle and other incidents of
their
<p>everyday life.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I sat near a group of very old men who were close to the fire holding
their
<p>drinks and talking of the things they had done in their youth - the
cricket games
<p>they had played, the races they had run. Old John Gorrie was in the
thoughtful
<p>mood. "I wonder which of us will be next," he whispered. Each of them
was aware that he was nearing the line that all must cross.
<p>Plates of sandwiches and drinks were offered frequently. Stories of
fairies
<p>and ghosts were told. Almost everyone had a favourite story to tell
and it was
<p>listened to with solemn and earnest appreciation. Newcomers were welcome
and
<p>asked to sit and tell a story to "shorten the night."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I left the old men and went into the parlour where my grandmother was
<p>talking to some of the most important ladies of the community. Their
talk
<p>consisted mainly of the virtues of their children and the affairs of
the parish.
<p>Having paid their respects and offered condolences, they remained only
a short
<p>time and withdrew in dignified solemnity to their waiting coaches.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On the third day a great many people came to the house and went upstairs
for
<p>the last time. In the afternoon a hearse, drawn by two horses draped
in black
<p>and with tall black plumes on their heads arrived at the house. A group
of men
<p>went upstairs to place grandfather in his coffin. Mother called me to
join my
<p>brothers and sisters for a last look at grandfather before they closed
the lid.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The coffin was carried downstairs, placed in the hearse, and the procession
<p>started for the graveyard. A long line of carts and carriages followed
by a
<p>large number of mourners on foot proceeded down the lane for the two
mile journey
<p>to the cemetery. Because of the walkers, the pace of the horses was
held back,
<p>so the procession moved very slowly. As we went past the cottages, the
cottagers
<p>came to stand outside, the men holding their hats on their chests and
the women
<p>standing with bowed heads.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>At the churchyard gate, we were met by the surpliced rector who stood
<p>waiting with a group of people who had come to join in the burial service.
The
<p>rector led the way to the graveside and when the coffin was beside it
he began
<p>the service, "I am the resurrection and the life .…"

<center><b>CUSTARD FOR TEN</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Grace Wood</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>It was the best of times, and the worst of times, Effie thought as she
sat
<p>at the kitchen table snapping green beans for their evening meal, fanned
by a hot
<p>summer breeze. The screen door slammed behind her husband as he entered
to
<p>announce the dreaded news, "The threshers are coming. They will be here
<p>tomorrow."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"How can I cope with ten threshers to feed?" she worried. This first
year
<p>of married life and of housekeeping in the Peace River country in 1913
was so
<p>different from her life in England. "My life as a child living with
the maiden
<p>aunts never prepared me for this day," she groaned.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Her husband, Angus, was a proud man, of Scottish descent. "No one will
go
<p>away from my table saying they have not had enough to eat," he was wont
to say,
<p>for his status as a staunch church warden in the community church had
to be
<p>maintained.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Never give the men custard pie," he admonished.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Why not? What is wrong with good old-fashioned custard pie?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Now Effie, you know perfectly well that men need something more substantial
<p>than custard pie when they are working a full day in the fields," he
said.
<p>"Besides, they don't like it one bit!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"If they don't like pie, then let them eat cake!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Her husband fixed her with a steely blue gaze, the look she had seen
so
<p>often before. She wondered what he was thinking, but he said nothing
more,
<p>except to look glum and forbidding. Perhaps marrying a man so much older
than me
<p>was not such a hot idea, she thought.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"But Angus, I told you when you asked me to marry you that I didn't
know how
<p>to cook. You blithely promised, 'All I need is a bit of meat, some potatoes,
and
<p>I will be happy'. I didn't know I would be competing with the best cooks
in the
<p>community, and I don't remember you saying that I would have ten men
to feed!"
<p>she went on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She was quite sure these men wouldn't settle for just meat and potatoes.
<p>The more she thought of it, the more her horror grew. She prayed a silent
prayer
<p>that it wouldn't rain. If it should rain between now and Friday night
she would
<p>have the threshers to feed over the weekend, and <i>again</i> on Monday
until the
<p>harvesting was finished.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On Tuesday evening Mr. McKelvin drove into the yard and left his threshing
<p>machine. Next morning three teams of horses each drawing a wagon and
rack were
<p>driven into the yard by their drivers, accompanied by casual helpers.
To Effie
<p>it might as well have been an army! She was relieved to find they already
had
<p>eaten their breakfast, and her first required meal would be at noon.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She hoped Angus had seen to it that there was a good supply of dry wood
for
<p>the old black wood-burning range in the kitchen. Without dry wood, this
whole
<p>meal would be a disaster. This wood-burning stove would be the death
of her yet!
<p>Where, oh where was her aunt's gas range!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Effie knew the men were very critical of the kind of board they got
and she
<p>was anxious for all to go well. She looked anxiously down the road to
see if her
<p>neighbour Mrs. Gunner was in sight as Mrs. Gunner had promised to help
her for a
<p>few days. Effie already had a roast of beef in the oven, but there would
be a
<p>big pot of potatoes to peel, carrots to scrape and peas to be shelled,
not to
<p>mention the damn pies! Mrs. Gunner finally arrived and soon the vegetables
were
<p>ready to be put on the stove and boiled.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Now for the pies. When she went to get the apples for paring, she found
to
<p>her horror that they were nowhere to be found. Were they left out of
the grocery
<p>order? There was no time to get more. What could she do? As she searched
<p>diligently for the apples, she remembered the look Angus had given her
when she
<p>made fun of custard. That thought returned to haunt her.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, all was ready and the long table had been set up with twelve
place
<p>settings. At precisely 12:00 noon the men stomped in with a clatter
of heavy
<p>boots. The chairs creaked as they sat down to the table, eagerly awaiting
their
<p>food. A delicious odour of roast beef wafted in from the kitchen. The
meat and
<p>vegetables were served and quickly eaten. Now...what did the men behold
on the
<p>table before their eyes? Yes...custard pie!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Effie hurriedly left the room, not waiting to see the look on their
faces as
<p>they surveyed their dessert. As she departed, to her great relief she
heard Mr.
<p>McKelvin say to Angus, "This is the best custard pie I have ever eaten.
I wish
<p>my wife would make it some time, instead of that everlasting apple pie!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Eureka," said Effie to herself, "I'm famous for my custard pie, even
if
<p>Angus has his reservations!"
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>GOLD OF ANOTHER REALM</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Beatrice Kerwood</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>"Imagine my discussing a job offer by the Parks Board in Victoria a
week ago
<p>and landing here in the freezing wind of the Cariboo Mountains." Bess
Sinclair
<p>decided it was madness, but the daily postal van which had delivered
her from
<p>Quesnel had disappeared from the empty dirt street of Barkerville.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bess knew she would have to find her bearings to begin her job as the
<p>curator of the Barkerville museum. "Right now, I feel like an alien
from another
<p>world," she mused, as she stood there on the small boardwalk of the
restored
<p>gold-rush town of 1860.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bess deposited her bags in the log-house she would occupy for that summer
<p>tourist season of 1972. Next, she made her lonely way through the empty
main
<p>street to open for the first time the great wooden doors of the museum.
Being
<p>the first of the staff to arrive she had the place to herself. She browsed
<p>eagerly through the great collection of mechanical equipment used to
extract gold
<p>during those early gold rush days, and as she did so, her imagination
went
<p>soaring back, back to the lives of Barkerville's earliest inhabitants.
She
<p>hurried to the office where she had been told she would find a treasury
of
<p>historic journals. She was eager to read these personal accounts of
human
<p>endeavours to survive the hostile world of the gold-rush days.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She was enchanted by the heroic account of Emily Kelly's arrival at
<p>Barkerville after travelling with her husband through a wilderness of
<p>unimaginable hardships, a hundred years ago. "Tell me, Emily, was it
madness or
<p>your love for your Ned that helped you survive?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bess became so involved, she almost wept over Emily's pluckiness, as
she
<p>read about Emily's arrival in the tent city of rough miners, dressed
as the new
<p>bride she was, in her splendid wedding suit. "To think, dear brave Emily,
that I
<p>was exhausted and complaining after an overnight bus ride. Imagine what
you had
<p>to put up with!" Bess mused happily all day that first lonely time away
from
<p>real family, having adopted this kindred spirit, Emily, as her own.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When she had finished work for the day, Bess made her way among the
deserted
<p>log cabins to the one she would make her home, her courage rising to
match that
<p>of the amazing lady she felt so close to. Her cabin no longer felt empty
and
<p>lonely. She wanted to prove to herself that women could bring changes
into the
<br>lives of others and that they could overcome hazards as Emily had done
when she
<p>arrived in this town of Barkerville in 1872, a scene scarcely changed
in the
<p>hundred years that had passed before Bess found herself standing in
the same
<p>street.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bess was exhausted after that first day of exploration of the early
days of
<p>this ghost town, but the log fire soon glowed on the dark wood of the
walls and
<p>the cosy red of the brocade drapes and cushions on the wicker furniture.
<p>Lighting the lamps, and putting water on to boil for tea, Bess sank
onto the
<p>hooked rug in front of the potbellied stove.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I wish I did not feel so small and alone here, with those giant shadows
<p>flickering and the mountain wind moaning." Bess's small, crouched figure
with
<p>her brown eyes shining in the firelight only began to relax as she chuckled
over
<p>her own desolate feeling of loneliness, compared to the trials Emily
had endured
<p>to reach this place.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Emily, you did have Ned Kelly whom you must have adored," Bess mused,
<p>"Otherwise, Emily, it was madness coming through hell to get here with
him.
<p>Didn't your comfortable farming folk try and stop you, after that splendid
<p>wedding they gave you in Brockville, Ontario?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Sleepily Bess lay in front of the stove, hearing Emily's voice echoing
in
<p>the air: "Tut, tut, girl, you should know well, young lovers cannot
be parted.
<p>My Ned had intended to seek his fortune in the gold fields and then
return to
<p>marry. 'Twas I would hear none of that and convinced him to marry first
and take
<p>me with him. Yes, it was my wiles which won my darling over! That is
what young
<p>love is about, as well every woman knows!" Emily's tinkling laugh chased
the
<p>shadows away.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The wicker chair creaked as Emily settled back to tell her story to
her
<p>lonely and curious friend.…
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir><i>Three weeks out of Yale, where we had left the paddle steamer,
my Ned, his</i>
<p><i>two mates and myself, with our loads strapped on each of our ponies,
had given up hope of getting safely through the terrible undergrowth of
the mountain passes, and the river washouts of the valleys. You see, during
a storm, we had lost the trail.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>This special morning at sun up, the men were busy. Cory was measuring
out</i>
<p><i>the last oats for a breakfast gruel. Ned was returning from the riverside,
laden</i>
<p><i>with a large billy can, his companion with a stack of wood. They
were in</i>
<p><i>tattered breeches, looking like starved vagrants.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>I told Ned, when the other miners had staggered on, "I'm going to
bathe in</i>
<p><i>the river and change into my wedding suit for our arrival at Barkerville
today.</i>
<p><i>You had better do the same or I shall disown you!"</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Believing we were lost and nowhere near Barkerville, Ned thought
our hunger</i>
<p><i>and hardships had taken my senses. I let him think so, as he dropped
the billy</i>
<p><i>can and followed me to the river's edge, trying to cajole me into
explaining this</i>
<p><i>mad act. I said not a word, but undressed entirely. He told me he
thought I</i>
<p><i>would soon be floating down the river out of reach of him, like Ophelia.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>So tearing off his filthy poncho and breeches, he flung himself into
the</i>
<p><i>water almost as soon as myself, trying to rescue me from an icy death
and yellin'</i>
<p><i>"Jesus, I'll freeze! Dearest, I beg you, forgive me. I promise to
get you</i>
<p><i>home!"</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Having succeeded thus far, but cold as an iceberg, I dunked my head
and as</i>
<p><i>his was pressed close to mine, pleading to me and God, I dunked it
as well and</i>
<p><i>his own hair and beard got the soap I had hidden on a rock earlier.
Both of us</i>
<p><i>were fresh-smelling, if frozen.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Then, speechlessly, we dressed in the fine suits of our wedding day,
with</i>
<p><i>Ned torn between cursing my madness and fearing for my health. He
marched me by the hand up to the fireside, our finery not yet buttoned,
and answered his</i>
<p><i>companions' stares with chattering teeth: 'We fell into the river.'</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>When the mugs of tea were doing their cure, Ned came repeatedly to
kneel</i>
<p><i>before me and beg me to speak to him. Cory and his mate had pulled
ahead as</i>
<p><i>usual, their axes and billy cans rattling on the ponies' packs. 'You
know I will</i>
<p><i>get you safely to the gold fields and promise you not one day of
discomfort if</i>
<p><i>you only get well and be my happy Emily again.'</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>'Of course,' I answered, calmly and sanely, much to his surprise.
I was</i>
<p><i>now buttoned and shining, with high boots, and feathered bonnet,
standing in a</i>
<p><i>clearing in the wildest forest of God's country with not another
soul in sight.</i>
<p><i>I was ready to tell the truth.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>I was trying not to laugh as I explained the trick I had played to
get him</i>
<p><i>cleaned up. As he listened, he tried hard to control his rage. He
thought I was</i>
<p><i>mad to imagine us arriving anywhere but into terrible hardship, still
miles from</i>
<p><i>any sign of human fellowship.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>"This morning, I smelled the smoke of the many campfires of Barkerville
and</i>
<p><i>left you men sleeping as I dragged my sore body to the waterfall
above our camp.</i>
<p><i>Just past, through dark cedars I saw the faint smoke, and clambering
on, looked</i>
<p><i>down on the blessed sight of the tents of Barkerville. I knew, hungry
as you</i>
<p><i>men were, you would rush off like mad things if I told you, not thinking
to</i>
<p><i>change and clean up first. So I made plans to hide the truth till
I knew my man</i>
<p><i>and myself were cleaned and dressed as a proper bridal couple, proud
to come to</i>
<p><i>their new home."</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
Stirring from her place on the floor, Bess heard a tinkling of laughter
that
<p>might have been Emily's and left that courageous friend in the past.

<center><b>LUCY'S WEDDING</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Alfreda Steindl</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>"Please let him be alive," was Lucy's fervent prayer as she cycled through
<p>the Sussex countryside in the early morning drizzle. She was glad of
the five
<p>mile ride to work. It would give her time to think. Tom, her Canadian
soldier
<p>fiance, had been transferred to Newhaven two weeks earlier; she had
not heard
<p>from him since. The morning news of the Dieppe raid was a shocker. Newhaven
was
<p>the closest point across the channel from Dieppe, and Tom would not
be allowed to
<p>communicate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"We are to be married on Monday, four days from now; I don't know whether
he
<p>is dead or alive." Strange thoughts were racing through her mind. "A
good thing
<p>I didn't spend my clothing coupons for the year on a long white dress."
She had
<p>bought a pretty blue outfit, it could be worn anywhere, a pair of fairly
<p>sensible shoes, and a rather silly hat. "Well at least nothing will
be wasted."
<p>She felt guilty. "Stop thinking about clothes and think about <i>him</i>."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lucy arrived at the little shop where she was employed, tears trickling
down
<p>her cheeks. It was hard to overhear snatches of conversation about the
morning
<p>disaster and to concentrate on serving customers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The noise on the street, what was it? Crowds in the street, cheering
and
<p>roaring. Some of the survivors of the raid were returning through the
town.
<p>Lucy, running out onto the steps saw men, many wrapped in blankets,
some walking
<p>and others riding in army trucks. Frantically she looked for her husband-to-be,
<p>but she could not see him. He must be dead or horribly wounded.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cycling home that evening Lucy made a decision, she would cancel the
<p>wedding. She was to be married in the lovely old Norman Church in the
next
<p>village. Afterwards a few friends and family from London were gathering
at her
<p>grandmother's house, where Lucy lived. A simple family wedding to be
followed by
<p>a two-week honeymoon in Scotland.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Would it be a good idea to go straight to the vicar's house to tell
him
<p>before he went home?" Lucy wondered. Yes, she would do that, his door
was
<p>always open, he would understand the dilemma of a nineteen-year-old
bride-to-be. The Rev. George Forster was a handsome bachelor. Lucy had
been a little in love with him for four years. He was the confidant of
the young people in the congregation and ready to listen at any time. Drinking
the inevitable cup of tea provided by the housekeeper, Lucy poured out
her story.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"My dear," comforted the vicar, "don't cancel your wedding. Tom may
turn up
<p>at the last minute. This kind of thing is happening. I will be at the
church at
<p>ten o'clock Monday morning. Go home and hope for the best."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Tom did appear at Lucy's door, with his best man Eric, very late the
night
<p>before the wedding.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lucy and Tom's wedding was a merry one, with friends and family, cake
and
<p>champagne. They were to catch the afternoon train to London to spend
the night,
<p>then the morning train to Port William, Scotland for two weeks on a
farm.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lucy's sisters Dorothy and Eileen, on night shift for the Civil Defence,
<p>offered their flat on the King's Road, Chelsea, for the night in London.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Thanks a lot, we would love that, much better than a hotel." Tom's
<p>enthusiasm surprised and disturbed Lucy. She knew that her sisters would
be
<p>wanting their bed at 6 o'clock in the morning. She felt disappointed,
a hotel
<p>would be more romantic and why didn't Tom consult her?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was a hot stuffy night at the King's Road flat.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Why do we have to sit at the back of the restaurant, there is a table
by
<p>the door, it would be cooler," Lucy complained.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"More privacy here dear, we are on our honeymoon," Tom held her hand
"Wonder if there is a back door to this place, I would rather not run into
any of my army
<p>pals, they might want us to party all night."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Next morning the starry-eyed bride and her handsome husband she was
so proud of were boarding the train to Scotland. It was Lucy's first trip
to the north.
<p>She was looking forward to gazing out of the window at a different kind
of
<p>scenery.
<p>"Why do we have to sit so far from the window, there are seats on the
<p>platform side of the carriage," sighed Lucy.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"It's better here dear, more room and no one will push by us."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After two hours of holding hands in ecstatic silence Tom suggested coffee
<p>and buns.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Darling do you mind getting our coffee, you are so much more familiar
with
<p>the British trains than I am."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Enamoured, but puzzled, Lucy brought coffee, thinking, he has been here
for
<p>two years, travelling on British railways.
<p>Two weeks in Scotland were unforgettable, and Tom confided in Lucy.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Darling," he said, "my behaviour on the train was a little strange.
I have
<p>left my gas mask back at camp and it's a crime in the army not to carry
it. I
<p>might be in trouble. Do you mind watching out for Military Police on
the way
<p>home?" Lucy, feeling important and full of adventure, agreed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Forty years later Lucy and her thirty-eight year old son were celebrating
<p>his birthday, both of them feeling sentimental after several glasses
of wine.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Mum, did Dad ever tell you that he was *<i>A.W.O.L. </i>when he married
you?"
<p>Lucy stared, memories of long ago were flooding back. Was this why she
didn't
<p>see her bridegroom for two months after their parting in London, and
of course he
<p>never would peel a potato.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>"We've beat the snow! The mountainside is clear,

<p>"My missus'll be glad to see me home,"
<p>A grizzled veteran cheerfully remarked.
<p>"Will we get a bonus for this job?"

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jim stayed behind to tidy the campsite.
<p>Gazing up the mountain, all he saw
<p>Was thousands of tree stumps, with new-fallen snow
<p>And low-hung clouds shrouding the upper slope.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then he heard an unaccustomed sound
<p>And turned to see a pair of jean-clad men -
<p>One a stripling, the other old and grey.
<p>He'd never seen a native cry before
<p>Except for alcoholic maudlin tears,
<p>But this old man was sobbing audibly.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"What's the matter?" Jim was moved to ask.
<p>The older man sobbed on. The youth replied,
<p>"He don't know English. But he brought me here.
<p>To show me where he got his spirit name.
<p>He climbed right up this mountain, ate no food,
<p>And had a dream. We call him Running Deer
<p>Because he had this dream. For many years
<p>He told us how the trees stretched to the sky
<p>And all the many animals he saw,
<p>Every one a friend to humankind.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Look now at grandpa's mountain! Not a tree
<p>Left standing: even mice cannot live here,

I had been shocked to hear strange-sounding children's voices yelping and
<p>snorting in the street. Looking out I saw a dozen of them shambling
by. Some of
<p>them drooled and some had tics. They were under the care of three young
women.
<p>Who could the children be? How could they be allowed out in our nice
<p>neighbourhood? They could be thieves or child molesters. I worried about
<p>Millie. She was only five and very friendly.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We had just bought our first house in a lovely part of town close to
a
<p>beautiful park and a big shopping centre, and it had a view of the North
Shore
<p>mountains. We thought that it was the perfect place to raise Millie
and the
<p>baby, and now I was shattered to think that I would have to keep them
in all the
<p>time because of the strange children.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After a week or so I realised that they were from a special school nearby.
<p>They always passed at 10:30 so I kept Millie in at that time. The rest
of the
<p>day was safe for her to play outside, but the children fascinated her
and she
<p>waved to them through the window when they went by. Many of them waved
back.
<p>They certainly were friendly. I got into the habit of standing with
her and
<p>watching them while she told me about them and the names she had made
up for
<p>them. The teachers' patience amazed me because I could never have done
what they
<p>were doing. Some of the children could barely talk and they were uncoordinated,
<p>but their friends helped them when they fell. They were kind and nice
to each
<p>other, not squabbling and fighting like the usual grade school kids.
As I saw
<p>more of them, they were no longer an anonymous crowd but individuals.
Even the
<p>three little mongoloids had different personalities. The smallest was
the most
<p>cheerful, blowing kisses to Millie as he stumped by with his rocking
gait. How
<p>could I have suspected him of being dangerous? One boy was clinging
and
<p>demanding, and the teacher would release him gently after talking to
him, so that
<p>he was content to fall back with the others. There was a dark boy in
a
<p>wheelchair who picked on a little girl with a monstrous head and huge
blue eyes
<p>and teased her constantly. I wondered if he were really retarded or
if his
<p>handicap was physical. He behaved like your regular kid. There was a
pretty
<p>little girl with wide set eyes who looked perfectly normal, which made
it sadder that she was handicapped.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We were settling in and I stopped calling Millie into the house when
the
<p>children's walk time came around. She went to the gate to say "Hello"
to the
<p>smallest Down's Syndrome boy. I was making friends with other mothers
when we
<p>went to the park with the stroller. One morning I was having coffee
on the front
<p>porch with Mrs. Green when the children came by and Millie ran to the
gate to
<p>greet her special friends: David, Mike and Linda.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Look at those weirdos," said Mrs. Green. "Fancy letting them loose
like
<p>that."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I saw my bitten fingernails and the pile of cookies set out for my morning
<p>sugar fix and her loaded ashtray and the sunbeam dancing on the coffee
cup
<p>trembling in her hand.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"What weirdos?" I wondered.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>A TRANSFORMATION</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hanny Ekelund</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>"You heard what I said, you've got to be polite. From now on you are
going
<p>to greet every person on the street with a loud enough voice to be heard
and in
<p>good time too, not when you've already passed. And don't forget the
name of the
<p>person and the title, you hear?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And the high school teacher in that long-ago, far-away country town
went on
<p>drilling his students in exactly the right manner he wanted this greeting
to be
<p>performed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She didn't like it much, this drilling, as if she didn't already know
how to
<p>be polite. She had never been rude, and furthermore, she always greeted
people,
<p>even people who didn't care and who wouldn't even acknowledge her.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>- Ha, right, now she knew. With her usual skill in turning any hated
task
<p>into a delightful game, she had already made her plans.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On her way home from school, she tried to comply with her teacher's
<p>admonishments, but it was hard while looking out for the person she
really wanted
<p>to meet. Well, no luck today.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mother was pleased to see her back from school so early. The thirteen
year
<p>old was known to dawdle quite a bit on the way home.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"You could go and do some shopping for me," she said tentatively, expecting
<p>a whole barrage of excuses. But none came.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Sure, what do you want me to get?" The pleasantness was unbelievable.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>With shopping-list and shopping bag the girl set out, scanning the streets
<p>all the way to the store. On her way back, her efforts were rewarded.
She spied
<p>him a long way off, the old, bent figure of a man limping toward her.
She
<p>steeled herself.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Good day, Herr Baldinger!" she said in a loud voice and with a bright
<p>smile. But he just stumped by her, as gruff as ever, without as much
as looking
<p>up.
<p>"Well now, I didn't really expect anything else yet," she told herself,
"but
<p>we will see how long it takes. I bet I can make him notice me within
a week, if
<p>I meet him every day. And maybe, in another week, he will even say something,"
<p>she thought hopefully. She really didn't have to be afraid, he was only
a very
<p>lonely old man, living all by himself, and nobody seemed to like him.
He must be
<p>quite sad and maybe had nothing to be pleased about. She felt sorry
for old Herr
<p>Baldinger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When she met him the next day, she doubled her efforts, making her voice
and
<p>smile especially friendly. But still no answer came.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Patience, she warned herself, don't give up, you'll win. And on she
went,
<p>greeting the old man, and finding special ways to meet him.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And sure enough, a week later, as she met him again, hobbling past the
old
<p>schoolhouse, her "Good day, Herr Baldinger!" was rewarded. He looked
up, into
<p>her face and the surly expression seemed to have mellowed. He looked
her
<p>straight in the eyes, his glance sharp and inquisitive, but his answer
was only a
<p>grunt.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She was delighted! It did have some effect. Just keep it up.
<p>- But then, she didn't see him for almost a week. She was so disappointed,
<p>she really missed him. She didn't know what had happened to him. She
still kept
<p>looking out for him. Maybe he was sick and had nobody to look after
him. Should
<p>she go and visit him? Bring him something? She knew the house he lived
in.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then, one afternoon, she met him again by the town fountain. He seemed
to
<p>be looking for someone, and when he saw her, he kept right on looking
at her
<p>until she was near enough to say her greeting.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Good day, Herr Baldinger!" She said it almost shyly, this time. Because
<p>it seemed, he had been missing her too. And sure enough.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Good day to you too!" he replied and there was almost a smile on his
face.
<p>He wasn't quite used to smiling, yet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She smiled at him then, brighter than anytime before, and it seemed
to her,
<p>as if she had received a rich gift this day.

<dir>Shadow-like, he slipped into the office,
<p>And stood, head bowed, eyes focussed on his toes
<p>That poked from holes in string-tied running shoes.
<p>"They tell me you're not working very hard,"
<p>The principal began, "and in this school
<p>We have no room for slackers. You came here
<p>From Christmas Harbour seven weeks ago;
<p>You need to do some homework to catch up.
<p>Promise me that you'll work harder now."
<br>&nbsp;

<p>To placate tired teachers, required now

<p>He shuffled, played with belt loops on his jeans,

<p>Our house is always full of visitors

<center><b>THE HUMILIATION</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Joan Pedersen</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>The 350-mile journey from Vancouver up the west coast to Rivers Inlet
had
<p>taken six days. Their tiny vessel, a gillnetter, aptly named "The Half-as-Much,"
<p>was but a scant twenty-seven feet in length, even including the net
roller.
<p>Fishing boats of this size were considered one-man-only boats.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But it had borne the three of them safely northward, mile upon mile,
its
<p>motor chugging faithfully up the Inside Passage, through rapids navigable
only at
<p>slack tide, then onward through Johnstone Strait, stopping at Port Neville
and at
<p>historic Alert Bay on Malcolm Island. It had been necessary to lay over
two
<p>nights at Christie Pass while anxiously awaiting safe weather reports
for the
<p>eight-hour run across open seas to the welcome shelter of Rivers Inlet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And now, at last they were completing the final distance north-east
to the
<p>very head of the inlet. It was called R.I.C., short for Rivers Inlet
Cannery,
<p>named for one of the many fish canneries which had flourished along
the coast
<p>during the early part of this century. R.I.C. was to be their temporary
home
<p>for the next month. They would be fishing for the company and would
therefore be
<p>allowed to stay at no charge in one of the company cottages.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Elizabeth was relaxing on the aft deck enjoying the beautiful ever-changing
<p>scenery. She was remembering the months of preparation for this unique
holiday.
<p>It had been her husband Wilf's idea to combine the pleasure of exploring
these
<p>coastal waters with the adventure of undertaking commercial salmon fishing
for
<p>the summer.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After months of searching, they had purchased the "Half-as-Much" together
<p>with a good nylon net. And then, in accordance with the Department of
Fisheries
<p>regulations, they had obtained three Commercial Fishery Licences including
one
<p>for their son, Michael, who, to his enormous pride, was officially listed
as the
<p>"eight year old assistant aboard the "Half-as-Much"!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Elizabeth looked fondly at her dear husband and son, who were together
in
<p>the wheelhouse, Mike happily being allowed to steer up the narrowing
inlet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"What do you think our cottage will be like, Dad?" he asked, ever
<p>enthusiastic for the next step of this family venture.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"It won't be a palace, son, I'm sure of that. But it will be good to
have a
<p>place ashore, especially on the days when fishing is closed."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was close to darkness when they finally arrived, picking their way
among
<p>the several floating docks and fish boats in the tiny harbour. It appeared
<p>abandoned for the night, until they saw the welcoming beam from a waving
<p>flashlight. As promised, the company caretaker was there to meet them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Hello. Fred Arnold's the name. The boss phoned that you would be here
<p>tonight." He secured their line and courteously handed Elizabeth onto
the dock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I can tell you, we're really happy to see you!" said Wilf with heartiness
<p>and relief.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Arnold was friendly and pleasant. He had been with the company for
many
<p>years. Was actually retired now, he told them. But he worked during
the summer
<p>months as caretaker of the company properties which included the enormous
non&ordf;functioning cannery and a collection of cottages, duplexes, actually.
"All in
<p>pretty poor shape," he added.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"You folks must be weary. Just bring what gear you need for tonight
and I
<p>will take you right now up to the duplex the boss assigned for you.
It's a bit
<p>of a climb up through the trees. Just follow my light."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>They proceeded along the floats, up the ramp and along the stationary
dock
<p>to dry land. The climb up through the trees took but a few minutes.
Mr. Arnold
<p>was careful to occasionally shine his light back for his three tired
followers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Here it is. Cabin #12 -- A and B. It is a duplex, you know. I am putting
<p>you in A. B is already occupied."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>He fumbled a few moments for a key and then finally unlocked the door
and
<p>switched on the light. The lone light bulb in the ceiling lit the room
with
<p>harsh clarity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>They knew, as Wilf had earlier told Mike, that their accommodations
would be
<p>"no palace." But what they saw was, to them, quite appalling. Furnishings
<p>consisted of a rickety bed, a table and three wooden kitchen chairs,
one with the
<p>entire back gone, converting it to a stool. Along one wall was a counter
and
<p>some open cupboards. Elizabeth and Wilf could think of nothing to say.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Wilf noticed the old stove-pipe hanging perilously from the chimney.
It had
<p>at one time channelled smoke from a stove which must have burned out
and had long
<p>ago been removed. "What happened to the stove?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Well, you know how it is," said Mr. Arnold in a confidential tone.
"These
<p>places get so abused. The company can't keep them. Most folks live aboard
their
<p>boats these days."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Elizabeth sensed that he was feeling defensive and uncomfortable. She
was
<p>wondering how they would manage without a stove. They would have to
bring the
<p>Coleman from the boat. That would take care of cooking. It was the total
lack
<p>of heat that could be a real discomfort. Even in the summertime the
night-time
<p>chill had been increasingly apparent as they had travelled northward.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Well," said Mr. Arnold, "I will leave you folks to settle in."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Arnold. We'll see you tomorrow." They tried to hide
their
<p>disappointment as they bade him goodnight.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Even alone, they could think of little to say. For the first time since
<p>their journey began, the day was ending in disappointment.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"We can put our sleeping bags on the floor," said Wilf, "and just forget
<p>about this wobbly-looking bed."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"And we will keep the Coleman stove here instead of on the boat," said
<p>Elizabeth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly she remembered that the other half of the cabin was occupied.
<p>"Shhh," she chided, "We must be quiet. I'm afraid we must have awakened
our
<p>neighbours. It is nearly midnight!" They moved about quietly, conversing
in
<p>whispers as they unpacked a few belongings.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then, to their astonishment, Mr. Arnold re-appeared. "Look," he began
with
<p>enthusiasm, "I have just been thinking and I suddenly remembered about
another
<p>duplex, down closer to the wharf. It would be a lot handier for you
folks. It
<p>has a nice big oil stove and it is kind of nicer furnished too." Mr.
Arnold was
<p>looking pleased and excited. "Now you folks just get your gear together.
Here,
<p>I'll help you. We'll go back down that hill right now and get you all
settled in
<p>quicker'n a wink!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The walk down to their new home took but a minute, Mr. Arnold chatting
<p>companionably the whole way. "Mr. Bill Grant lives on the other side
of your
<p>cabin. He runs the store. Comes up every summer just to run the store.
Nice
<p>quiet fellow. You will like him."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Elizabeth realized he was taking pride in conducting them to their new
<p>quarters. Then, as they emerged from the wooded path, he pointed with
his
<p>flashlight. "There, that's it. Right next door to Bill Grant. And look,
that's
<p>my cottage, just yonder there."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Their cottage was already unlocked. "I lit the stove for you. It sure
<p>warms up fast! Tomorrow I will show the missus just where the oil drums
are,
<p>just inside the old cannery."
<p>Wilf, Elizabeth and young Michael were again almost speechless, but
this
<p>time it was with pleasure and relief.
<p>"It is lovely, Mr. Arnold." Elizabeth said gratefully. "And much handier
<p>to the docks, too," added Wilf. "Well, folks I'll leave you to get some
sleep
<p>now."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But, with his hand still on the door-handle, he turned back to them.
It was
<p>as though he felt compelled to offer a few more remarks before he left.
He could
<p>see that they were relieved and happy with their new abode. Perhaps
he
<p>remembered his recent hapless remark of having "suddenly remembered"
about this
<p>duplex. He was a man who, for most of his life, had believed firmly
in obeying
<p>all the rules and in doing exactly as he was told. He was trustworthy,
reliable
<p>and obedient, and took pride in these qualities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But tonight had been different. Tonight he had made an independent
<p>decision. He had disobeyed his boss's instructions. He was enjoying
what he had
<p>done for this small family and he wanted to share his elation with them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"You see," he began, "I think the boss had got things wrong. He thought
you
<p>was native folks. So he told me definitely to put you in number 12-A.
He
<p>figured that would be plenty good enough. But as soon as I saw you,
and this
<p>little fair-haired gaffer here," he paused while giving Michael an affectionate
<p>hair-tousling pat on the head, "I knew number 12 A was no good for you.
And I
<p>could see it was going to be tough for the missus here, too, with no
stove! So I
<p>just decided on my own to change things!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"You know," he continued, "it doesn't matter too much for the natives.
They
<p>just let things go to rack and ruin anyway. But, for you, well, I just
decided
<p>to go right back up there and bring you folks down here with me and
Bill Grant."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>And with these final revealing remarks, he was gone.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Arnold knew he had left them feeling very happy. He was pleased
he had
<p>explained it all to them. As he walked over to his own nearby cottage,
he
<p>pictured the family happily examining their new abode, exalting over
their good
<p>fortune, and feeling grateful to him, Fred Arnold. He would surely have
been
<p>astonished to know that at that moment Elizabeth and Wilf and young
Mike were not
<p>exalting. They were, instead, troubled and upset. Elizabeth was the
first to
<p>speak.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Oh, dear," she moaned, "Here we have this marvelous stove, this lovely
<p>warmth, and I feel absolutely awful! We have somehow, unwittingly, become
<p>participants in a philosophy and hateful prejudice we both detest!"
She was
<p>becoming increasingly angry as she spoke. "How can these feelings exist
in this
<p>beautiful place? Oh! I feel terrible! I feel ashamed! I feel humiliated
to
<p>have listened to that talk!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Wilf had listened quietly to her tirade. Then he crossed the room and
gave
<p>her an affectionate and reassuring hug. "Look," he said, "you know I
share your
<p>feelings completely. But as you have just said, the whole situation
is truly an
<p>unwitting one for us. You know as well as I that we can't suddenly demand
to be
<p>put back in number 12-A. And besides, in a kind of ironic way, I felt
sorry for
<p>old Mr. Arnold. His anti-native prejudices have become ingrained over
his life-time. He just took it for granted that we would share them. But,
going against
<p>the boss! Now, that took courage! That was a giant step for him! He
did it
<p>because he liked us and it would never occur to him that his remarks
were
<p>offensive." There was a pause, and then he added, "We shall be here
a month.
<p>Perhaps we'll have a chance to influence things a little. You never
know."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In his quiet thoughtful way, Wilf had a calming approach. Elizabeth
agreed
<p>that what he said was reasonable. "But I'm still angry and humiliated,"
she
<p>insisted, as they finally fell asleep.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next morning brought early activity to the R.I.C. community. The
<p>fishery, having been closed for four days, was to re-open at 10:00 A.M.
Down at
<p>the floats the fishermen were checking their gear, tuning up their motors,
<p>storing extra gas and provisions. Most of the boats would be out for
the entire
<p>72 hours of this next open period. Wilf, in his comparatively small
craft,
<p>undertaking commercial fishing for the first time in his life, planned
to be out
<p>for twelve hours only, for a start. He would try it alone for this first
time.
<p>"When I think I'm getting the hang of it, you and Mike can come with
me," he told
<p>Elizabeth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There was a flurry of excitement as the boats were preparing to leave.
All
<p>the wives and children were down on the floats helping to stow gear.
There was
<p>joviality, chatting and laughter and a great deal of advice-giving as
everyone
<p>hurried about in the early morning sunshine.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly, out of a nearby family group, a middle-aged Indian woman came
<p>toward Elizabeth holding out her hand in greeting.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Hi!" she said. "My name is Edith Joe. You must be the lady who moved
in
<p>to the duplex beside us. I heard you arrive last night. Must have been
around
<p>midnight. I was real happy. I thought I was going to have a fisherman's
wife
<p>for a neighbour. You know, it sure is nice to have another wife to talk
to
<p>sometimes. I thought we could visit back and forth, like. I guess I
went back
<p>to sleep. But this morning when I woke up, you had moved. It sure was
a shame.
<p>A real shame."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Elizabeth had expressed her feelings of anger and shame with articulation
<p>and vehemence. Now, in her confusion, she could only think that it is
one thing
<p>to theorize angrily about principles, about ideals, about evils and
ills, human
<p>weaknesses, and failing courage. But it is quite another experience
to meet a
<p>friendly woman who is simply and sincerely saying that she is sorry
not to be her
<p>neighbour.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She shook hands with Edith and they sat down together on a raised plank
at
<p>the edge of the float.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Then Elizabeth began to speak, to try to explain. "Oh, yes," she said.
"It
<p>is truly a shame," she said. "You see, actually, it was the stove. I
wondered
<p>how we would manage without a stove. Of course we had the Coleman. But
it was
<p>the need of heat, you see. And then Mr. Arnold moved us. We have a stove
now.
<p>It was really the stove. It would have been nice to be neighbours. It
is a
<p>great shame!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly, she was silent. She realized she had been talking at two,
perhaps
<p>three times her normal rate of speech. Her heart was pounding. She had
been
<p>babbling.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There followed a long, long silence. Elizabeth felt there was nothing
left
<p>for her to say. She knew she had sounded shallow and silly. And yet,
in her
<p>anxiety she had simply gone on and on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The silence continued. Elizabeth turned her head to look at Edith.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But Edith was lost now in far-away thought. She might have been watching
<p>some of the boats now departing. But her gaze was beyond the ships.
Perhaps it
<p>rested upon some distant point only in her thoughts.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The silence continued, but Edith seemed unaware of it, or of Elizabeth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, Edith spoke in a slow, wooden, unanimated, and low voice. "Yep,"
<p>she repeated again. "It sure was a shame. It was a real shame!"

<p><b>GYPSIES ARE PEOPLE TOO</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p><br>
<br>
<p>My sister Betty and I grew up during the Depression. If our parents
werepoor we weren't aware of it. We were no better and no worse off than
any of ourschool friends. Life was quite simple. We didn't expect a surplus
of clothes ortoys, for, like children of the times, we had learned to get
along with what wasavailable to us.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bordering our property was a stream called Silver Creek. By summer it
wastoo shallow to swim in but we loved to play hide and seek and make believe
gamesamong the trees that lined its banks. To get there we had to cross
a gravelhighway and railroad tracks.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the spring the Gypsy caravans would appear pulled by scrawny horses.
Wenever knew where they came from or where they were going, but sometimes
theGypsies would camp in a small clearing by the creek.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Keep away from them Gypsies," our mother used to tell us. "They're
thievesand they steal little children." The ominous tone of her voice convinced
us weshould never tempt fate by even going near their camp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We were afraid of the Gypsies, but we were curious too. To us, it seemedlike
they had a wonderful life. Their children didn't even have to go to school.
They just travelled around the country and had no chores to do.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Do you know any Gypsies, Mama?" I asked my mother one day.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She looked at me as if I had lost my mind. "Don't be silly, child. Ofcourse
not. But my daddy told me all about them." From the tone of her voice Iknew
the stories she had heard were not to be repeated for our tender ears.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But a day came when my mother discovered that all the stories she had
heardabout Gypsies were not necessarily true. The Gypsies themselves proved
thestories to be more fiction than fact.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The town where we lived was on the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan.
During the Depression hundreds of men rode in boxcars back and forth across
thecountry. They had no jobs and no money and nobody wanted them. The trains
wouldstop and the police would make the men get off so they couldn't cross
into thenext province. They would camp at the "hobo jungle" -- as my father
called it --by the creek at the edge of town until another train came along.
Sometimes themen were desperate and dangerous. We were warned never to
go there.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One day Betty and I were walking home from school when a rabbit hoppedacross
the road in front of us. Without thinking, we chased it across thE
<br>tracks, down a bank, and before we realized where we were we had run
right intothe hobos' camp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There were three men sitting by a fire roasting chickens on a spit they'dmade
out of willows. They jumped up when we burst in on them. With theirunshaven
faces and dirty clothes, they looked like ogres. We were terrified. Betty
and I looked from the men to the chickens. We didn't have to be very smartto
know they had been stolen.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One of the men grabbed Betty. I tried to run but was dragged back into
thecircle. The hobo holding Betty shook her roughly. "Well, what're we
going to dowith these two?" he snarled. "What do you say, Mike?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mike scowled at us. "We don't want to be picked up for stealing a couplelousy
chickens." He turned to the third man, the youngest of the three. "Whatdo
you think, Dave?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dave shrugged. "They're only kids. Let 'em go."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"And have the police here before we can clear out? Forget it! What shouldwe
do, Roger?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Roger released his grasp on Betty. There was a long silence before he
madeup his mind. "Let's throw them on the next freight train. By the time
they'refound we'll be out of here." Betty and I clung to each other. We
knew he wasserious.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Just Dave walked over and stood beside us. With a quick motion he gaveBetty
a push. "Run girls. Run for home," he yelled. Before Roger could react,Dave
shoved him to the ground. Betty and I took off like frightened deer. Wecould
hear Mike and Roger yelling as we scampered through the trees. The twohobos
were right behind us as we dashed through the clearing into the Gypsy camp.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Help!" we screamed. "They're after us."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A woman, sitting by a caravan, stood as we ran to her. She folded us
intoher long skirts. "What's going on? Why you chase these girls?" she
askedsternly.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"We want the kids," Roger said, gasping for breath.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Gypsy lady pointed her finger at the men. "You go. Now!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Roger started to walk slowly towards us. Betty and I squeezed closeragainst
the woman. When he was only a few steps away we heard a gruff voicebehind
us, "Go. Go or I shoot!" We spun around and saw a Gypsy man standing inthe
door of the caravan pointing a rifle at Roger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Roger eyed the man warily for a few seconds, then cursing, he and Mike
slunkback through the trees.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Betty and I couldn't believe we were safe. Safe in a Gypsy camp! We
clungto the woman, afraid to let her go. Later, when we had calmed down,
her husbandescorted us home.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When my mother heard how we had been rescued she shook the Gypsy's hand
and thanked him over and over. She insisted on walking back to the caravan
so shecould thank the brave lady who had helped us personally.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>So, from a frightening childhood experience, Betty and I, as well as
mymother learned a valuable lesson about discrimination that has carried
over intoour adult lives--and that of our children.

<p><b>INDERJIT</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Nan Poliakoff</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>She had been sick for four months after coming to this country. "Too
much sick in my head," she told me. She meant anxiety and loneliness, I
figured. (As a new teacher, I was always eager to apply what I had learned
about immigrants and culture shock.) She asked me to her wedding, still
months away, commenting, "I am too happy I get married."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Now I sat on the floor of that great room in the Gudwara Sikh Temple,
feeling quite alienated from what seemed like hundreds of friends, relatives
and members of the community. I closed my eyes, carried off by the rhythmic
drumbeat and soothing drone of the music, but was interrupted by the yells
and giggles of children running around upstairs. (My children had been
invited, but I hadn't brought them for fear they would make noise.)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Suddenly the music stopped. People quietened as the rear doors opened.
A woman emerged, dressed in the traditional red wedding costume. She was
stunning, radiant like a sunrise. Her dark hair fell gleaming down her
back. Gold bands and chains decorated her neck and wrists. Her eyes shone
like black pearls and her lips were heavily painted red. I stared, trying
desperately to find a connection between this woman and the girl I had
met less than a year before.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She had been more awkward than the other young single or newly&copy;married
women. She usually wore jeans and shirts in contrast to their traditional
Punjabi suits. Her braids were often scruffy, while the others were impeccably
groomed. Most of the women did their writing exercises neatly, quietly,
obediently, and their speaking in class was planned and deliberate. But
Inderjit was spontaneous and careless. She was angrily political. I remember
her jubilation over the death of Indira Ghandi. She seemed to want to express
so much. Her writing was incomprehensible. She was frustrated. I was impatient.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jolted back to the present by the start of the ceremony, I then watched,
with minimal comprehension, the lengthy, traditional Sikh wedding. I hoped
to talk to Inderjit afterwards, but when the service ended, the couple
went off for some quiet time together, as the custom dictates. Disappointed,
I said goodbye to anyone I recognized and headed home.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The following week she came to class, transformed. She wore an elegant
silk Punjabi suit, and some of the gold jewelry she had received for her
wedding, and was again heavily made up. I was thrilled to see her. "I didn't
think you'd be back!" I greeted her.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Oh yes," she replied, matter-of-factly. "My husband say: 'First learn
English, then get driving license, then have babies.'" "And no blue jeans,"
she added. "That's for hooker ladies."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I see," I said, trying not to shudder conspicuously. "So how's married
life?"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She looked at me blankly. "I am married now," she said. "This is my
new life."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The others smiled. She was one of them.

<p><b>LIFEWRITING: PERSPECTIVES AND PROSPECTS</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the world of commercial publishing it is generally acknowledged that
while truth may indeed be stranger than fiction, it also sells more books.
Titles of non-fiction works in publishers' catalogues outnumber and outsell
works of fiction. This is especially true in the realm of personal stories,
whether of heroic exploits or biographies, which seem today to have replaced
the novel as the staple of the reader's narrative diet. Indeed, the traditional
literary art of the novelist now finds expression in the "non-fiction novels"
of Norman Mailer or Truman Capote, just as in television the "docudrama"
of a real-life situation draws upon a public appetite to find out what
really happens while still enjoying the dramatic portrayal of characters
in action.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the past, biography has been valued for several extrinsic reasons.
Literary biography, for example, was an adjunct of literary criticism,
when it was assumed that knowledge about an author's life and times adds
to our understanding of the literary works which the author had produced.
An even older tradition values the story of a person's life for the moral
or religious lessons that can be drawn from such an exemplum. Thus Augustine's
<i>Confessions </i>or the lives of mediaeval saints were regarded as part
of the testimony to the power of Christianity. Even that notable pioneer
in the field of literary biography, Dr. Samuel Johnson, justifies literature
for its utilitarian or moral values. In an essay for his <i>Rambler </i>weekly
magazine (No. 60) Johnson claimed that "there has rarely passed a life
of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be useful." In the
middle of the eighteenth century the lives of ordinary people could serve
the same sort of purpose as the hagiography of earlier centuries because
Johnson recognized in this essay the bond of commonality in the human condition:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>We are all prompted by the same motives, all deceived by the same
fallacies, all animated by hope, obstructed by danger, entangled by desires,
and seduced by pleasure.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
In a later essay written for his <i>Idler </i>magazine (No.84. November
24, 1759) Johnson might be seen as a prophet for the modern age when he
declared: "Biography is, of the various kinds of narrative writing, that
which is most eagerly read, and most easily applied to the purposes of
life." And because Johnson, the great moralist, put such a value on truthfulness,
he carried his argument a stage further by suggesting that autobiography
(although the term had not been invented then) would have an added value
because "those relations are therefore of most value in which the writer
tells his own story," especially when the story was not to be published
for self-glorification:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>He that writes an apology for a single action, to confute an accusation,
to recommend himself for favour, is, indeed, always to be suspected of
favouring his own cause; but he that sits down calmly and voluntarily to
review his life for the admiration of posterity, or to amuse himself, and
leaves the account unpublished, may be commonly presumed to tell the truth,
since falsehood cannot appease his own mind, and fame will not be heard
beneath the tomb.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
Biography has also been valued for the knowledge and insight it records
about public affairs, and it is no accident that in a public library the
shelves of biography are incorporated into the sections that hold the history
collection. Moreover, in modern times the concept of "revisionist" history
may lead us to distrust all historical interpretation, restoring our faith
in the eye-witness journalistic accounts of wars and famines to give us
a sense of what really happened and what it was like to be a person embroiled
in the affairs of history. There is no doubt that the myriad of war memoirs
of personal experiences in the violent and exciting acts of World War II
has contributed to the great bulk of autobiography that is available to
the reader today.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But it is only in the last two decades that autobiography has become
accepted as a literary form worthy of attention in its own right, apart
from any value it has for history or psychology. James Olney (1980), in
an introduction to a seminal collection of articles about autobiography,
suggests that the popularity of this genre is due to our current preoccupation
with the place of the<i> self </i>in society. Since 1977 the academic journal
<i>Biography </i>has published an annual bibliography of books and articles
about life-writing. The changing situation of this literary genre is also
described by Elizabeth Bruss (1976), while Janet Varner Gunn, in her book
<i>Autobiography </i>(1982), attempts to develop "a poetics of experience."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The difficulty of giving this genre some literary respectability lies
in the fact, as Michael Mason (1987) points out, that "in life-writing
authenticity and immediacy may be more important than literary sophistication."
Nevertheless, this increasing attention to the theory of autobiography
has lead Cockshut (1984) to begin a taxonomy of the various types of autobiography
in nineteenth and twentieth-century England. Jerome Buckley in <i>The Turning
Key </i>(1984) examines the nature of "the Subjective Impulse" in autobiography
since 1800, and Susanna Egan (1984) begins her <i>Patterns of</i> <i>Experience
in Autobiography </i>with a chapter on "the inevitability of fiction."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Once we turn from the <i>reading </i>of Lifewriting to the <i>creating
</i>of Lifewriting, we can see that autobiographical writing is something
that is possible and valuable for any literate person, and that the development
of a literary style is not a prerequisite for a person who wishes to record
a personal story. James Moffett (1968) recommends "phase" autobiography
as a smaller form of autobiography accessible to younger student writers.
Richard Beach (1977) describes his experience teaching students techniques
for developing what he terms "AMP writing," the three forms of autobiography,
memoir, and portrait, in which "students attempt to capture the nature
or essence of self." In his <i>Life-Writiitg: A Glossary of Terms in Biography,
Autobiography and Related Terms (1980) </i>Donald Winslow includes other
forms such as the apology, memoir, confession, diary, journal, reminiscence,
anecdote, recollection, personal history, and the "auto-novel," any of
which are available to the developing lifewriter.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Lifewriting pieces in this collection demonstrate this wide range
of writing modes. The stories and poems in this anthology all originate
in the events and incidents of their authors' experiences. All are necessarily
short in order that a representative sample of the achievements of people
in lifewriting groups could be included. The general reader may find some
delight and entertainment in these depictions of small slices of the human
condition. But the real value of lifewriting lies in what the stories have
achieved for their authors. First there is the sense of satisfaction that
derives from having been able to recapture an event, or a person, or a
relationship in words. The act of writing becomes synonymous with the act
of remembering. Writing, in fact, helps people to remember and reconstruct
experience.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For many of these lifewriters, their contribution to this anthology
represents only a sample from their ongoing effort to write about their
lives. For some, the story or poem printed here may be regarded as a first
step in a long journey of life review, in which case the pride of sharing
this initial effort may provide the needed encouragement to sustain the
author through the effort of capturing more of the experience of living.
What is seen here as an isolated incident or insight is better regarded
as a single pearl from a necklace of events and people that make up a lifetime.
Other lifewriters, in order to deal with more complex issues and events,
write much more extensively than could be accommodated in an anthology
such as this. But whether they have composed a succession of discrete events
or chapter-length episodes, these lifewriters are already on the way to
creating a fully-fledged autobiography or family history.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The difference between the standard autobiography and these Lifewriting
samples is not simply a matter of size or scale. From the point of view
of the average lifewriter the prospect of beginning to write a complete
book may be an undertaking that is simply too overwhelming to be countenanced.
For most people the thought of putting together some forty or fifty thousand
words may seem to be a task only slightly less arduous than climbing Mount
Everest. Not many people are able to tackle the climbing of such a mountain,
yet anyone is capable of setting foot on some of the approaches and perhaps
conquering some of the lesser foothills.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lifewriting, in fact, is well within the reach of the ordinary person
who has the ability to tell a personal story or anecdote. There is a variety
of techniques described in our text on <i>Lifewriting </i>(1988) to help
people discover and articulate the stories that are important to them.
Lifewriting begins with the reassurance that everyone has the power to
become an author, because if the lifewriters can <i>think </i>of stories,
they can tell these stories; and if the stories can be told, then they
can be written and printed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The following anecdote by Mr. Russell Robinson originates from an introductory
Lifewriting session at a senior citizens' centre. As a heuristic, the group
was asked to think about and list the places that were, are, or would be
important in their lives, using the model of the Lennon/McCartney song
"In My Life," with its theme of places which are remembered all through
life because of their associations with lovers and friends. The members
of the group were given a data sheet and paired.up for an interview with
a partner in order to explore the memories and feelings that lay beneath
the surface of the bare facts of an incident or place. After a very animated
session in which each member told a life story to his or her partner, volunteers
were asked to re-tell the story to the whole group and respond to any questions
or comments from the listeners. This verbal interaction produced a lot
of clarifying details to make the stories come alive. Here in print the
story loses some of this initial excitement.

<center><i>MY RECOLLECTIONS OF OUTLOOK, SASKATCHEWAN</i></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><i>I remember those days well because, thinking back, they were the
best times I had growing up. As a youth. I was active in sports: hockey,
curling, swimming, and horseshoe pitch.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>The horseshoe pitch was the happiest time of all because</i> <i>all
you'd hear was the clink of a horseshoe hitting an iron post. The camaraderie
between youth and grown-up was marvellous. We could hardly wait for spring
to arrive so we could get back at it again.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>One sports day my father and I entered into the</i> <i>horseshoe
pitch competition. We got through to the finals where we had to play against
Mr. Sieve Brockbank and Mr. Charlie Brown, who had also got through the
contest undefeated so far.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>It was a beautiful day--not a cloud in the sky. The game progressed
until it was all tied up coming up to the second to the last end. Mr. Brockbank
threw first, and he got a double ringer. My father turned to me and told
me if I didn't cancel these two ringers he would kick my backside up to
my shoulders. I did not want a sore behind so I did cancel those two ringers.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Then my father threw his first horseshoe. A ringer! But he missed
on his second. Mr. Brown threw his two horseshoes. A double ringer! We
had lost the final by three points.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>That was the most eventful day for me. I really enjoyed it. It was
the best part of growing up.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
The winning or losing of a competition during a village sports day might
not seem a very momentous occasion, but what brings this anecdote to life
is the language which gives it the ring of truth. In his Address to the
English Association Victor Pritchett (1977), himself an autobiographist,
declared that reviewers often tended "to lump autobiography and the novel
together as examples of two different ways of telling agreeable lies."
But in this case the absolute sincerity of the writing creates for the
reader some sense of the value which this piece has for its author. Maybe
the horseshoe pitch competition would not constitute a treasured memory,
as a more sentimental occasion might do, but the bare re-telling of this
story gives the incident an aura of the importance which it had for him
in his youth, and which it still has in his maturity. There are hints here
of what may have become some of the major themes of the author's life:
certainly there is an idyllic quality in this portrait of rural Saskatchewan,
suggesting the simple humanity in the relationship between young and old.
The reference to other sports suggests that this author might have many
other sports stories waiting to be surfaced into consciousness. But what
is intriguing to the reader is the relationship between the son and his
father hinted at in this phrase of dialogue. Here lies a possibility for
this lifewriter to recall other incidents involving his father in order
gradually to build up a composite portrait.
<p>The general reader of Russell Robinson's anecdote can appreciate the
honesty and directness in his writing, and marvel at the power of his memory
which allows him to recall the details of a long-past event. While the
story is complete within its own structure, we can also see it as the seed
which can grow into a more fully developed autobiography or family history.
The town of Outlook, Saskatchewan will lead to other towns, cities or provinces.
The horseshoe competition will suggest other sports, other occasions, defeats
or victories. The portrayal of his father on this occasion will lead to
other stories of growing up, other family relationships, other incidents
which recall the life of the family. "Outlook, Saskatchewan" shows us clearly
the difference between lifewriting and autobiography. Both have human interest,
and literary style and structure, but where autobiography pretends to be
the complete life, Lifewriting points to the themes which grow and intertwine
throughout our lives.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This process of life review, whether through interviews, group sessions,
or lifewriting, has long been recognized as a universal occurrence in older
people. At one time such reminiscence, associated with a garrulous old
person seen to be living in the past, was regarded as a sign of psychological
dysfunction in that the subject seemed to be escaping from the present.
Robert Butler (1963) in his interpretation of reminiscence in the aged
suggests that for some investigators reminiscing becomes a pejorative term
for 'the preoccupation, musing, aimless wandering of the mind." Butler,
on the other hand, sees life review "as a naturally occurring, universal
mental process characterized by the progressive return to consciousness
of past experiences, and, particularly, the resurgence of unresolved conflicts."
While under some conditions life review might have negative effects, Butler
suggests that when life review means the reintegration of life experiences
and values, the result is positive:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>As the past marches in review, it is surveyed, observed, and reflected
upon by the ego. Reconsideration of previous experiences and their meanings
occurs, often with concomitant revised or expanded understanding. Such
reorganization of past experience may provide a more valid picture, giving
new and significant meaning to one's life .
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
The motives which bring people of all ages into Lifewriting a re various
and need to be explored at more length. Some of the stories and poems in
this anthology demonstrate that for some people Lifewriting goes well beyond
the recording of stories and anecdotes for a personal or family history.
No story, of course, is without literary value, but in this anthology we
can see how some authors use their life experiences to develop stories
that are carefully structured, using a third-;person narrative persona
and frameworking devices to distance the story from the personal story.
In the beginning Lifewriting is an act of memory when the facts and details
of experience are recalled, noted, and incorporated into the drafts of
a narrative or verbal portrait. But in the end Lifewriting becomes a task
of written composition when the author must labour through the processes
of editing and revision to achieve a form which expresses the author's
vision of the world.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here then is a poem by Marina Lambie, who is currently engaged in recreating
the story of her family, expressing the link between the images of everyday
life with the artist's struggle to capture experience, values and visions
in the scratching of a pencil on paper or the silence of an electronic
word processor.
