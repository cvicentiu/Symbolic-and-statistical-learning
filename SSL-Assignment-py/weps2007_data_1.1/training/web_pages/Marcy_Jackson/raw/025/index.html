<strong>GATEWAY RETREAT</strong><br />f<em>or prospective Courage &amp; Renewal facilitators</em><br /><br />Thurs. June 14 - Sun. June 17, 2007 <br />Islandwood&nbsp; •&nbsp; Bainbridge Island, WA<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />ABOUT THE GATEWAY RETREAT</strong><br /><br />The Gateway Retreat is designed for persons interested in becoming Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitators. In the Gateway Retreat participants will experience a circle of trust retreat, learn more about what is entailed in becoming a facilitator, and explore next steps for application to the Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program.<br /><br />The Gateway Retreat will be led by&nbsp; Marcy and Rick Jackson, Co-directors of the Center for Courage &amp; Renewal and Bev Coleman, long time courage facilitator.&nbsp; All three are experienced Courage &amp; Renewal facilitators who have led retreat programs for teachers, educational leaders and leaders in medicine, philanthropy, law, and other serving professions. <br /><br />In large group, small group, and solitary settings, we will explore the intersection of our inner journeys and our work in the world, making use of personal stories, reflections on professional practice, and insights from poets, storytellers and various wisdom traditions. On the last day of the retreat we will talk about formation principles and practices, the role(s) of the Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator, and address questions regarding the Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program, the Courage to Teach, Courage to Lead, and circles of trust.<br /><br /><em>In a circle of trust we can grow our selfhood like a plant—from the potential within the seed of the soul, in ground made fertile by the quality of our relationships, toward the light of our own wholeness—trusting the soul to know its own shape better than any external authority ever can.</em><br /><br />—Parker J. Palmer, A Hidden Wholeness: The Journey toward an Undivided Life, Jossey-Bass Publishers, 2004<br /><br /><strong><br />DATES, TIMES, AND VENUE</strong><br /><br />The retreat will begin at 5:00 p.m. with dinner Thursday, June 14th, and will conclude with lunch on Sunday, June 17th. The retreat will be held at IslandWood (<a href="http://www.islandwood.org" title="www.islandwood.org">www.islandwood.org</a>), a beautiful 255-acre retreat and outdoor learning center on Bainbridge Island, in Puget Sound (an easy 35 minute ferry ride from downtown Seattle.)<br /><strong><br />FEES, TRANSPORTATION, AND SCHOLARSHIPS</strong><br /><br />The program fee of $650.00 covers tuition, room, and board. Rooms are double occupancy. Participation is limited to 30 persons. A modest fund is available for partial scholarships based on demonstrated financial need. For more information contact Robin Gaphni at 206-855-9140 or at <a href="mailto:robin@couragerenewal.org">robin@couragerenewal.org</a>. Participants are responsible for their own transportation costs.<br /><br /><br /><strong>APPLYING FOR THE GATEWAY RETREAT</strong><br /><br />To apply, please submit the application (attached), your vitae/resume, and a personal statement that addresses the questions on the application form, along with a check or money order for $650.00 (made payable to the Center for Courage &amp; Renewal). <br /><br />Note: In our years of preparing facilitators we have found that the more personal experience with the circle of trust approach that a potential facilitator has, the better. Our facilitator preparation program is not a &quot;train the trainer&quot; model. There is a high degree of subtlety and sophistication to this type of leadership; therefore, it is strongly recommended that persons interested in becoming facilitators have attended at least one introductory circle of trust retreat or Courage to Teach retreat prior to applying for the Gateway Retreat, and subsequently to the facilitator preparation program.<br /><br />Applications must be received by the Center by April 1, 2007. <br /><strong><br />NOTIFICATION</strong><br /><br />We anticipate more applications than spaces available. Applicants will be notified of selection decisions by May 1, 2007. Upon acceptance, participants will receive a detailed agenda and information regarding travel and logistics to and from IslandWood. Payments will be refunded in full to those who are not accepted.<br /><br /><strong><br />LEADERSHIP TEAM FOR GATEWAY RETREAT</strong><br /></p><p>Beverly Coleman, M.S.W., was a secondary school educator for almost thirty years, and is currently a retired school social worker in SW Michigan. She worked with individual students and peer facilitator groups and was the founder and facilitator of a peer counseling program which received state recognition. Bev is an experienced Courage to Teach and Courage to Lead retreat facilitator. She has led Courage &amp; Renewal retreats for educators, judges and drug court personnel, and persons in other serving professions.<br /></p><p>Marcy Jackson, M.S.W., M.P.H., is Vice President and co-director of the Center for Courage &amp; Renewal, and has primary responsibility for CCR courses and programs, including the Facilitator Preparation Program. She has been facilitating COURAGE TO TEACH® and circle of trust retreats nationally since 1996. For the past 25 years Marcy has worked extensively with individuals, groups, and families as a child and family therapist. She has led retreats in a variety of settings—in hospitals and health care, educational and retreat centers, community mental health and tribal settings. <br /><br />Rick Jackson, M.A.R., M.Div., is President and co-director of the Center for Courage &amp; Renewal, focusing primarily on community and financial development, evaluation, and outreach. Rick consults and speaks with non-profit organizations and foundations on a range of topics, including sustaining the identity and integrity of teachers and leaders, the role of youth in culture, community leadership development, and strategies to foster long-term social change. He was ordained a minister in the United Church of Christ in 1979, and was an executive with the YMCA for 25-years. <br /><br /></p><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/files/Gateway2%202007.pdf">Click here to download Gateway application in pdf</a></p><p><br />The Center for Courage &amp; Renewal admits students of any race, color, sexual orientation, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to its students.

  <div class="entry"> <p align="left">The Center for Courage &amp; Renewal has developed a series of three consecutive circle of trust retreats.  These retreats are for those interested in experiencing a circle of trust and focusing on ways to bring deeper connections to their lives and work. This series of retreats is designed for persons in diverse professions - including education, healthcare, law, philanthropy, religious life, non-profit and community leadership.<br /> </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><em>Note: This series of retreats are distinct from our process of preparing Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitators. In the <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=programs/facilitator-preparation">Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program</a> we specifically prepare people to do in-depth inner work, with groups, over time. There is a detailed application and selection process for becoming a facilitator.</em></p><div align="left"> </div><h4>I. Introductory circle of trust retreat: “The Journey toward an Undivided Life&quot;</h4><div align="left"> </div><p align="left">This is a three-day retreat designed to offer an experience that focuses on the rejoining of soul and role, personal and professional life, and the relationship of the inner life to the outer work of service in the world. In these retreats participants will experience the implicit and explicit modeling of the conditions, processes and relationships that welcome the soul and encourage wholeness and integrity. Clearness Committees, a communal process of discernment around a difficult life or vocational issue, will be offered as part of this retreat (to read about Clearness Committees, <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=resources/writings/clearness"><em>click here</em></a>). </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><strong>Click on any of these dates to open a pdf file containing information and registration materials.</strong></p><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"> </div><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=node/125">February 8-10, 2007  <strong>Nashville, TN</strong></a> </p><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=node/127">April 26-28, 2007  <span style="font-weight: bold">San Rafael</span><strong>, CA</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=node/149">July 13-15, 2007  <strong>Chicago, IL</strong></a> </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><em><u>Note</u>: In addition to the circle of trust retreats offered through the Center for Courage &amp; Renewal, there are also cross-professional circle of trust retreats offered by Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitators in their own communities.

Designed for persons in diverse professions—including education, healthcare, law, philanthropy, religious/spiritual life, non-profit and community leadership—this four-day program explores, in more depth, the conditions noted in <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=resources/books"><em>A Hidden Wholeness</em></a> that help create a circle of trust:<br /></p><div align="left"><ul><li> Clear limits; intentionality</li><li>Skilled leadership (that knows how to create safe spaces for the soul)<br /></li><li>Open invitations (opportunity, not demand)</li><li>Common ground (seasonal metaphor; other unifying themes)</li><li>Graceful ambiance (settings and hospitality).</li></ul></div><p align="left"> A particular focus of this retreat will be on framing questions that invite the soul to show up (whether for personal reflection, small groups, or Clearness Committees). At the end of the retreat there will be an opportunity to consider ways of introducing this approach in participants’ work or organizational settings. </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><em><u>Note</u>: Attendance at a prior retreat is a pre-requisite; specifically, participants should have had a retreat experience that included a <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=faq">Clearness Committee</a>, as that will be built upon in this retreat.</em></p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left">We have two “Living the Questions&quot; circle of trust retreats scheduled for 2007. <strong>Click on any of these dates to open a pdf file containing information and registration materials.</strong></p><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"> </div><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=node/126">March 5-8, 2007 <strong>Portland, OR</strong> </a></p><p><a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=node/128">November 10-13, 2007 <strong>Nashville, TN</strong></a>  </p><div align="left"> </div><h4>III.

  <div class="entry"> <p align="center"><em>Is it possible to become more intentional about creating spaces—in<br /> relationship, in community—where our fearful shadows can emerge into the<br /> light to be seen for what they are, where the truth and love within us<br /> can appear and make a claim on our lives?</em></p><div align="center"> </div><div align="center"><em>We obviously are expert at creating spaces of other sorts. We know, for</em><br /><em> example, how to create spaces that invite the intellect to show up,</em><br /><em> analyzing reality, parsing logic, and arguing its case. We know how to</em><br /><em> invite the emotions into play, reacting to injury, expressing anger, and</em><br /><em> celebrating joy. We know how to invite the will to emerge, consolidating</em><br /><em> energy and effort on behalf of a common task. We know how to</em><br /><em> invite the ego to put in an appearance, polishing its image, protecting</em><br /><em> its turf, and demanding its rights!

Palmer</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Skilled facilitators are at the heart of our work. Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitators create a trustworthy space—a circle of trust—within which participants explore their inner lives and vocational and life questions. The approach we use in our work (sometimes referred to as “formation&quot;) is a personal and communal process that invites individuals to reclaim their personal identity and professional integrity, thereby clarifying and renewing their commitment to their vocation. This process assumes that every person has access to an inner source of truth, named in various wisdom traditions as soul, spirit, or heart—a source of strength and guidance that is the place of truth-telling within us where we know the difference between reality and illusion. By creating a quiet, focused, and disciplined space—a circle of trust—in which the noise within us and around us can subside, we can begin to hear our own inner voice.</p><div align="left"> </div><h4 align="left">About the Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program </h4><div align="left"> </div><p align="left">The Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program is a  leadership and mentoring program for preparing facilitators to lead circle of trust retreats, and to assist them in establishing personal and professional renewal programs in their professions or communities. Some may choose a seasonal retreat model similar to that used in the <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=programs/professions/education/CTT">Courage to Teach</a> program. Others may adapt this model in ways that are appropriate to their particular circumstance or profession. Regardless of the model, our hope and expectation is that these individuals will create personal and professional renewal retreats that work with people in a cohort model, over time, and that ascribe to the <a href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/?q=about/principles">key principles and practices of formation</a>. The Center for Courage &amp; Renewal prepares facilitators for work with those in serving professions such as education, healthcare, law, religious life, and non-profit and community leadership. </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left">In addition to planning and facilitating retreats, the facilitator also plays a crucial role in introducing and establishing these personal and professional renewal retreats in a community. This is not done in isolation. Often a small group of &quot;stakeholders&quot;—a group of interested advocates—is involved in these efforts. Thus, our facilitators combine roles of leadership and facilitation with responsibility for program development in their community or profession. </p><div align="left"> </div><h4><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-style: italic">For a full description of the Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitator Preparation Program please download the application below.</span></span></h4> </div>

  <div class="entry"> <p align="left">Numerous legal scholars have noted that the legal profession is suffering from a “crisis in identity and values�? and a decline in ethics and professionalism. Despite these trends, many law professionals want to reclaim the highest ideals that first drew them into the profession.

We were interested to know how the work was impacting individuals in each of the cohorts and devised a simple research design in which we asked participants to write a short narrative about an experience or event in the first retreat that awakened a sense of leading from within. In each of the successive retreats, participants got their original narrative back and were asked to reflect on how their sense of leading from within was deepening or changing. We have been sitting with the first set of narratives for a little over a year doing both a cross sectional and longitudinal depth analysis of them.</em></p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><em>What is apparent from these narratives is a deep sense of how courage work impacts individuals not only on an episodic basis but also over time. As we analyze the various threads and strands of the narratives of individual transformation it is also clear that the organization itself is being transformed, one conversation at a time.</em></p><p align="left"><a href="http://www.medicine.iu.edu/">www.medicine.iu.edu</a> </p><div align="left"> </div><p align="left"><strong>For more information on Courage &amp; Renewal Facilitators working in Medicine and Healthcare, <a href="//?q=programs/professions/medicine/facilitators">click here</a>.</strong></p> </div>

  <div class="entry"> <h3 class="first">Circle of trust retreats</h3>
<p>We offer cross-professional circle of trust retreats that address the &ldquo;depth dimension&rdquo; of leadership by encouraging participants to explore how their inner life is connected to their work. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/html/circles">For details&#8230;</a></p> 							 							<h3>Courage and renewal in professions</h3>
<p>For more than a decade, we have provided personal and professional renewal retreats and experiences for educators, who remain at the heart of our mission. In addition, we are now offering programs that address the specific needs of other serving professions. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.couragerenewal.org/html/ctt/intro-f.cfm">For details&#8230;</a></p> 							 							<h3>Facilitator preparation</h3>
<p>One of our primary contributions continues to be preparing facilitators, who create a safe space where participants can explore their inner lives and look at questions related to their work and their world.</p> 				

<p>Our next facilitator cohort begins in fall 2006. Information and application materials will be available on our web site this winter. </p>  					 </div>
