Before PADI's Tech Wreck, there was TDI.  Before TDI, there was IANTD.  
Before IANTD, there were a few cutting edge individuals writing the book 
that all the others would eventually use.  We know, because we were there.
In advanced and technical diving, one thing counts more than your training 
program, your education, your training dives and certainly the agency name 
on your c-card - experience.  If you missed the experiences of the first
decade of technical diving, your next best option is to take advantage of 
the instructors that were there.</p>
