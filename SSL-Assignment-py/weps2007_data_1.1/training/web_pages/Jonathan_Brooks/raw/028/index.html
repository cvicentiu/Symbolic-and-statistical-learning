<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Brooks is such a 
common name that it is very difficult to trace.&nbsp; The first proven ancestor in 
this line is that of Jonathan and Margaret “Peggy” Brooks, who lived in Madison 
County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">According to 
family records passed on by the late Lula Oliver Booth, Jonathan Brooks was born 
on November 27, 1762.&nbsp; No doubt it was in Virginia, and we continue to search 
for his family of origin.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">We speculate 
that Jonathan Brooks migrated first to Botetourt County, Virginia, where he 
appears on the tax list of 1787 as “Jon Brooks.”&nbsp; There, Jonathan Brooks married 
Margaret Reyburn on October 20, 1789.&nbsp; Some other Brooks appear in the Botetourt 
records, but thus far no proven connection has been made.&nbsp; Moreover, there was 
another John Brooks, who helped appraise the estate of Richard Bandy in December 
1795; witnessed the will of Cornelius Ruddell on April 10, 1798; and who helped 
appraise the estate of George Hannah in January 1799.&nbsp; Our Jonathan had moved to 
Kentucky by 1796.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Margaret Reyburn 
was born on April 30, 1767, according to the family records.&nbsp; She was the 
daughter of John and Jean Reyburn who lived most of their lives in Augusta 
County, Virginia.&nbsp; John Reyburn wrote his will on June 30, 1797, and it was 
proved on February 20, 1798.&nbsp; Among others, he named his daughter Margaret, and 
left something to her oldest son.&nbsp; In a subsequent lawsuit in 1812, the infant 
son’s name was given as Thomas Brooks of Madison County, Kentucky.&nbsp; (See this 
author’s work on the Reyburn family)&nbsp; Margaret also had a brother, Robert 
Reyburn, who settled in Madison County.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Jonathan Brooks 
and his family settled in Madison County by 1796, when he appears in the tax 
record, 1 male, over 21, with 7 horses.&nbsp; There were other Brooks in Madison 
County, even a John Brooks, but our Jonathan consistently distinguished himself 
by using “Jonathan” in the records.&nbsp; To date we have not found any connection of 
Jonathan to the other Brooks:&nbsp; Archibald, John, Robert, Henry and Lynch.&nbsp; 
Several of the latter settled on Otter Creek and established Brookstown.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Jonathan 
appeared in the tax records until his death.&nbsp; He was not identified with any 
particular piece of land for several years, and we assume he “cropped out” for 
other land owners.&nbsp; In 1802 he paid tax in Madison County on 60 acres, but 
curiously enough, the land was listed as in Montgomery County, on the 
“Lulbergrud Creek,” entered under the name of Edward Williams, probably the 
owner.&nbsp; In 1804, the 55 acres was listed in Montgomery County again.&nbsp; Lulbegrud 
Creek is about 10 miles north of Fort Boonesboro, and 12 miles east of 
Winchester.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Several years of 
Madsion County tax records are missing.&nbsp; In 1818 Jonathan Brooks was taxed on 
200 acres on the Kentucky River, under the names Walker and Allen, in whose 
names it was surveyed.&nbsp; In 1820 Jonathan listed 206 acres on the Kentucky River, 
entered under Walker.&nbsp; For a few years the tax list included names of 
regiments/companies the persons served in.&nbsp; Jonathan listed the Noland Company.&nbsp; 
Jonathan appeared on the tax list for the last time in 1826, 200 acres on Red 
River, total valuation, $2590.&nbsp; Actually, the land was in Madison County on the 
Kentucky River, near where the Red River enters it over in Clark County.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The 1810 Madison 
County Census provides another glimpse of Jonathan and his family.&nbsp; (Page 214)&nbsp; 
The census did not give family names, but noted that the household included the 
following:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 
male&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10-16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 
Females&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-5</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; “&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
45 or over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
5-10</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26-45</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">This data 
matches the birthdates that we know, for Jonathan was 48 years old in 1810, and 
Peggy was 41.&nbsp; Also, we know they had one son and four daughters.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In the April 
Court of 1817, the following entry was made: “On the motion of Jonathan Brooks 
it is ordered that the following be established his ear mark - , a crop of the 
left ear, and a half crop of the under side of the right ear.”&nbsp; (Court Order 
Book D, p. 329)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Jonathan Brooks 
purchased 206 1/2 acres in Madison County on the Kentucky River from Thomas 
Allen on September 9, 1819.&nbsp; He paid $200.&nbsp; (Deed Book N, p. 464)&nbsp; On May 26, 
1824 he bought 106 1/4 acres on Otter Creek from his son-in-law, Jeremiah 
Powell.&nbsp; (Deed Book Q, p. 162)&nbsp; Then, on July 3, 1826, he sold that land back to 
Jeremiah Powell.&nbsp; (Deed Book R, pp. 151-152)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Jonathan Brooks 
apparently died in January 1827, age 65, for the February Court was held on the 
5th, and William Black was appointed administrator of the estate.&nbsp; “Peggy 
Brooks, widow of Jonathan Brooks dec’d. relinquished her right of 
administration.”&nbsp; Nathan Lipscomb, Enoch Burton, Thomas Grubbs and Jonathan 
Floyd, or any three of them, were appointed to appraised the estate and make a 
report to the court.&nbsp; (Court Order Book F, p. 3)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Wendell L. 
Brooks, a descendant, wrote in January 1992 the following:&nbsp; “According to 
stories passed down through the family--Jonathan and one of his slaves went into 
the woods to cut some wood, when they did not return home the family went in 
search of them, they found a shallow grave with Jonathan’s body in it, but no 
sign of the slave.&nbsp; It was believed the slave killed Jonathan and then ran 
away.&nbsp; This story has never been factually proved, but has been repeated many 
times in the family.”</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Jonathan’s 
estate was appraised as ordered, and the report was brought to the court on 
April 2, 1827.&nbsp; Three pages of possessions were listed, including three slaves, 
Chasity, Nilly and Ann.&nbsp; They were valued at $200-300 each.&nbsp; Jonathan held 
several notes on people who owed him money.&nbsp; Jeremiah Powell owed $200, plus 
interest.&nbsp; Others included John Fluty, William Tinder, Isaac Whitsel, Thomas and 
George C. Howard, and William and Thomas Townsend.&nbsp; (Will Book D, pp. 268-272.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On March 16, 
1827, the “Jonathan Brooks heirs” went to court and sold the 206 1/2 acres, with 
the exception of the “widows dower” for the rest of her life, to Isaac Oliver of 
Clark County.&nbsp; The indenture mentioned Thomas Brooks and Elizabeth, his wife; 
William Brock and Jane, his wife; Jeremiah Powell and Nancy, his wife; and 
Charlotte Brooks; “the heirs of Jonathan Brooks, dec’d.&nbsp; (Deed Book R, p. 501)&nbsp; 
The deed was recorded on November 16, 1827.&nbsp; As we shall see, the land was sold 
to Isaac Oliver, who married Polly Brooks, another daughter of Jonathan.&nbsp; 
Regarding the widow’s dower, by law it was 1/3 of the estate as long as she 
lived.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">An estate sale 
was held, and a report made to the court on October 6, 1828.&nbsp; Apparently most 
everything, except the slaves, was sold.&nbsp; Peggy Brooks bought a bridle, tub and 
pail, warping bars, cups and saucers, sugar bowl and cream pot, bread tray, 
knives, forks and spoons, a “gilted” pitcher, a trumpet, cupbard, flax wheel, 
flour bag and meal bag.&nbsp; William Brock bought one large Bible.&nbsp; Charlotte Brooks 
bought a small hymn book.&nbsp; She also bought a secretary for $22.00.&nbsp; Livestock 
brought the most money:&nbsp; $36.00 for 20 hogs and $20.00 for a yoke of oxen.&nbsp; A 
clock sold for $30.00.&nbsp; Other purchasers included Jeremiah Powell, Isaac Oliver, 
Abraham and Charles Goolman and John Brock.&nbsp; (Will Book D, pp. 436-442)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">From the above 
and marriage records we can determine the children of Jonathan and Margaret 
“Peggy” Brooks at the time of Jonathan’s death in 1827.&nbsp; Since there was a large 
gap between the son and his sisters, we suspect there were more children who 
died in childhood.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1.&nbsp; Thomas 
Brooks was born on January 19, 1791, probably in Virginia.&nbsp; On April 11, 1812, 
he married Elizabeth “Betsy” Lee in Madison County, Kentucky.&nbsp; Henry Lee gave 
consent.&nbsp; According to Wendell Brooks, a descendant and researcher of this line, 
she was the daughter of William and Anna (Dickison) Lee of Virginia.&nbsp; Elizabeth 
was born on February 22, 1789, and a couple of years older than Thomas.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; 
another Thomas Brooks married Elizabeth Davis, daughter of Henry Davis, in 
Madison County on June 15, 1818.)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On August 15, 
1812, Thomas Brooks enlisted in the Kentucky Militia in Woodford County, and is 
listed as a Lieutenant on the roll of Captain Virgil McCracken’s Company, First 
Rifle Regiment.&nbsp; This was during the War of 1812.&nbsp; Thomas was wounded, and later 
received a pension for serving.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Thomas and 
Elizabeth lived in Madison County for the first few years of their marriage, but 
moved to Warren County, Kentucky, by 1820.&nbsp; The census of that year, page 40,&nbsp; 
notes this about the household:&nbsp; 1 male and 1 female 26-44, 2 males and 2 
females 0-9.&nbsp; According to family lore, Thomas returned to Madison County in 
1827, at the death of his father, to help settle the estate.&nbsp; Then he returned 
to Warren County, and the 1830 census notes this on page 90:&nbsp; 1 male 30-40, 2 
females 40-50, 2 females 15-20, 2 males and 1 female 10-15, and 1 female 0-5.&nbsp; 
Also there were two slaves, a male and female, both 10-20.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">According to 
Wendell Brooks, Thomas and his family, Mary Lee, Elizabeth’s sister, and a 
number of other relatives and neighbors from Warren County, formed a wagon train 
and headed for Illinois.&nbsp; They arrived in Warren County, Illinois in the early 
1830’s and settled in Berwick Township.&nbsp; In 1836 Thomas received some bounty 
land in Roseville Township, land received for his serving in the War of 1812.&nbsp; 
Thomas also purchased 45 acres in 1838, and in 1842 bought another 80 acres.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Thomas and his 
family were members of the Berwick Baptist Church.&nbsp; That church then organized 
the Union Baptist Church, founded on July 10, 1841, and Thomas was the clerk of 
the organizational meeting.&nbsp; At that time Thomas and his family became members 
of the new church.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Thomas Brooks 
died on September 19, 1842, and Elizabeth Lee Brooks died on February 19, 1847.&nbsp; 
Both are buried in the Berwick Cemetery, and an engraved stone marks the grave.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Thomas and 
Elizabeth Brooks had six children, and their names and birthdates are recorded 
in a family Bible:&nbsp; Emily born April 25, 1813; Julia Ann born August 12, 1814; 
William L. born October 13, 1816; Thompson born September 3, 1818; Mary Ann born 
October 16, 1820; and Acenath born January 7, 1825.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">2.&nbsp; Jane Brooks, 
daughter of Jonathan and Peggy, was born on December 7, 1799, according to 
family records.&nbsp; “Jenny” married James William Brock on October 6, 1825.&nbsp; He was 
the son of John Tinne Brock and Frances Wright Shackleford Brock, who lived 
across the Kentucky River in Clark County.&nbsp; Jonathan Brooks was bondsman.&nbsp; Rev. 
William W. Wright, grandfather of William Brock and Methodist Minister, 
officiated.&nbsp; William and Jane settled on the Clark County side of the Kentucky 
River.&nbsp; William died on August 9, 1843, and Jane died a month later, causes 
unknown.&nbsp; They left three children:&nbsp; Silas Jonathan, Simpson William and Emily 
Jane Brock.&nbsp; Simpson William Brock is the ancestor of this writer.&nbsp; For more on 
the Brocks, see John Tinne Brock of Clark County, Ancestors and Descendants, by 
this writer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">3.&nbsp; Nancy Brooks 
was born about 1801.&nbsp; She married Jeremiah Powell, widower, who first married 
her first cousin, Elizabeth Reyburn, on October 31, 1808.&nbsp; Obviously Jeremiah 
was several years older than Nancy.&nbsp; Nancy and Jeremiah got their license on 
October 19, 1819, and it was returned on October 23.&nbsp; Thomas Harber was 
bondsman, and Jonathan Brooks, father of the bride, gave his consent.&nbsp; Nancy and 
Jeremiah continued to live in Madison County.&nbsp; Jeremiah and his wife were listed 
in the 1830 census as follows:&nbsp; 1 male 40-50, 1 male and one female 20-30, 1 
female 15-20, 2 males 5-10, and one male 0-5.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The above record 
certainly indicates a blended family. A “Jerry” Powell, probably a grown son, 
was listed elsewhere in the census with his family.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On October 13, 
1854, a death notice in a Madison County newspaper stated, “In this county on 
the 11th Jeremiah Powell, an old and respectable citizen.”</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The children of 
Jeremiah Powell, by his two wives are not known for sure.&nbsp; A hint is found in a 
Madison County paper of October 24, 1894, when there appeared an obituary for 
Bishop George Powell:&nbsp; “Bishop George Powell died at his home in Speedwell, 
Madison County, Ky., on October 11, 1894, aged fifty-four years, five months and 
three days.&nbsp; He had been in delicate health for many years, and his demise was 
not unexpected.&nbsp; He lived a devout member of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
South, and will be missed in his community.&nbsp; He leaves a wife, son and daughter 
and also a brother, Squire J.H. Powell, of Richmond.&nbsp; These brothers were the 
only survivors of the family of Jerry and Nancy Powell, which consisted of five 
sons and two daughters.”</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Another child of 
Jeremiah and Nancy was Mary Powell, who married Absolom Dunn on January 4, 
1849.&nbsp; Jeremiah signed consent as father of the bride.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">4.&nbsp; Polly 
Brooks&nbsp; was born about 1803.&nbsp; She married Isaac Oliver on November 29, 1820.&nbsp; 
Joel Oliver was the bondsman, and Jonathan Brooks, father of the bride, gave his 
consent.&nbsp; Isaac and Joel Oliver were sons of Richard and Hannah Conkwright 
Oliver of Clark County.&nbsp; He was named for his uncle, Isaac Oliver, also of Clark 
County.&nbsp; As seen above, when Jonathan Brooks died, his land was sold to the 
son-in-law Isaac Oliver.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Isaac Oliver, 
born in 1791, had already married twice before in Clark County.&nbsp; On April 8, 
1816, he married Lucy Dawson.&nbsp; Spence Dawson posted the surety bond.&nbsp; Then, on 
January 18, 1818, he married Hannah Wood.&nbsp; James Wood was bondsman.&nbsp; After third 
wife Polly died, Isaac married Elizabeth Varner in Madison County on November 5, 
1844.&nbsp; Charles Searcy was bondsman.&nbsp; Then, finally he married Susan Varner in 
Madison County on January 5, 1863.&nbsp; The marriage bond notes that this was his 
5th marriage, that he was 72 and born in Clark County.&nbsp; Susan was born in 
Jessamine County, age 50.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On September 1, 
1869, Isaac Oliver, being “in debt,” granted 200 acres to Thomas Moberly and 
Joseph Oldham.&nbsp; (Deed Book 19, p. 179)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Isaac died after 
1870, when he last appeared in the census.&nbsp; He was listed as 81 years old; Susan 
was 61, born in Indiana; and in the home was Susan Bennett, 67, born in 
Virginia.&nbsp; On August 12, 1876, Susan Oliver, Isaac’s widow, wrote her will.&nbsp; She 
left her personal property to her step grandson, Isaac McClennin Powell, who was 
the son of William K. Powell and the late Eliza Powell.&nbsp; Otherwise, everything 
was to go to her sister, Lucinda Circy.&nbsp; The will was proved on October 7, 1878.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Following 
Susan’s death there was a law suit between John Newland, plaintiff, against 
Josephus Oliver, defendant, to split the land of Isaac Oliver.&nbsp; The court 
assigned commissioners to work it out, and they did.&nbsp; On January 18, 1881, they 
partitioned the land among the heirs, as follows:&nbsp; Josephus Oliver; Emarine 
Alexander and husband Joseph Alexander; Almarine McCrosty and husband Thomas 
McCrosty; John Newland, Isaac Newland; John A. Webb, Emarine Webb, Josephus 
Webb; Mary Jane Robb, James Robb; Almarine Long, C.L. Long; Frank Brock, John 
Brock, Silas Brock; Mary E. Powell and husband William Powell, Isaac Powell.&nbsp; 
(Deed Book 34, p. 474)&nbsp; The next day, January 22, 1881, the same heirs 
transferred the property, 58 1/2 acres to A.J. Willoughby.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Since Isaac had 
five wives, it is difficult but not impossible to sort out who were the mothers 
of his children.&nbsp; Fortunately his name is on several marriage bonds and one 
death record.&nbsp; Adding those names with the above census names, we count the 
following children, though not necessarily in the correct order:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A.&nbsp; Charlotte 
Oliver married Martin Brock on March 22, 1837.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver signed as witness.&nbsp; 
The 1840 census gives her age as 15-20.&nbsp; The 1850 census lists her as 25 years 
of age.&nbsp; Her child, Frances, was listed as age 12, meaning that Charlotte was 
about 13 years old when she married.&nbsp; We conclude that Charlotte was the 
daughter of Polly Brooks Oliver, and named for Polly’s sister Charlotte.&nbsp; Martin 
Brock was the youngest son of John Tinne Brock Sr. and Frances Wright Brock.&nbsp; He 
was born in 1815.&nbsp; Charlotte died between 1854 and 1857, and Martin remarried.&nbsp; 
Charlotte’s children, Frank Brock, John Brock, Silas Brock and Mary E. Brock 
Powell, were listed above among the heirs of Isaac Oliver.&nbsp; William I. Brock, 
another son, was omitted.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">B.&nbsp; Emerine 
Nancy Oliver married Joseph Alexander on October 3, 1842.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver signed 
as father of the bride.&nbsp; The mother was probably Polly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">C.&nbsp; Emily Jane 
Oliver married Allen Webb on February 17, 1844.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver signed as father 
of the bride.&nbsp; The mother was probably Polly.&nbsp; The children of Emily Jane and 
Allen Webb were John, Emarine and Josephus; and were listed as heirs of Isaac 
Oliver.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">D. &nbsp;Mary Jane 
Oliver married Anderson C. Newland on August 17, 1846.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver signed as 
father of the bride.&nbsp; The mother was probably Polly.&nbsp; Their children, Isaac and 
John Newland, are mentioned as heirs to Isaac Oliver.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">E.&nbsp; Meredith 
Oliver, age 24, born in Madison County, died of&nbsp; “congestive chills” according 
to the Death Records of 1852-1861.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver was named as parent.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately the exact date of his death is not given.&nbsp; The mother was 
undoubtedly Polly, since he was born between 1828 and 1837.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">F.&nbsp; Almarine 
Oliver married Thomas M. McCrosky on June 20, 1850.&nbsp; Isaac Oliver signed as

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">G.&nbsp; Josephus 
Oliver was born about 1838.&nbsp; The mother was probably Polly.&nbsp; In Richmond, on 
September 10, 1862, Josephus enlisted in Company A, 11 Regiment Cavalry, of the 
Confederate Army.&nbsp; He was made 2nd Corporal.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">I.&nbsp; Sarah 
Elizabeth Oliver was born in 1846.&nbsp; She was the daughter of Elizabeth Varner 
Oliver.&nbsp; On April 28, 1862, “Sarah Lizzie Oliver,” 16, married William Powell 
22.&nbsp; The marriage bond indicates that he was born in Clark County. Josephus 
Oliver was witness and Isaac Oliver gave consent as father of the bride.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The above

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">5.&nbsp; Charlotte 
Brooks, the youngest child of Jonathan and Peggy Brooks, was born on October 25, 
1805.&nbsp; Charlotte had not yet married in 1827 when her father died.&nbsp; She married 
Clark Rice in nearby Clark County on April 19, 1832.&nbsp; His birthdate was 
September 27, 1805.&nbsp; The marriage bond indicates that Charlotte was the daughter 
of Peggy Brooks, who gave consent.&nbsp; Polly Oliver was a witness, and William 
Brock was bondsman.&nbsp; The 1850 Clark County Census gives this data about the 
household:</p>
