William E. Brooks, son of Jonathan brooks, was born February 13, 1813. While yet young he became teacher of a primary school in the village of Cedarville, and while engaged in teaching his attention was turned to the study of medicine. He entered the office of Dr. Eli E. Bateman as a pupil, and subsequently matriculated at the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, from which institution he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine. He began the practice in the city of Philadelphia. He was exceedingly delicate, and had an hereditary predisposition to consumption, from which he died October 4, 1841. He was a worthy member of the Methodist Episcopal Church.<BR><BR>
