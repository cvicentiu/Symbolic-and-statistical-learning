         before i do a real write up, but since the articles we're
         doing for wotc won't be up for a few days at least i figured
         i'd just fill people in on what went on. i'll put in a few
         pics and some details, but the majority of what we have wotc
         gets first shot at. anyways, here we go.<BR>

         in general, the event seemed to run pretty smoothly. it was
         designed to be a smaller event, with less turnout than the
         sts programs. the exhibit hall it was held in was just the
         right size, there were plenty of tables and room for people
         to play. the decor was similar to the sts's, and there was a
         lot of staff on hand consisting of workers chosen by the TO
         and several professors as well.<BR>

         people to take the test on the site--and also one of the 3

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">we meant to play...we
         really were going to just go and play this time. but, we got
         there, and the staff shirts were just so cool......oh well.
         put away the cards, pick up the camera and the notebook and
         let's do some reporting!<BR>
         <BR>
         you'll see most of what we got later on, but for now here's
         a quick rundown of zeo at the eastern stadium....<BR>
         <BR>
         there was indeed a promo. promo 13 was handed out at the
         event to people who came up and asked for it. we had an
         initial rush of people when we walked in....the first east
         coast sts is where we launched the first zeo promo way back
         when and there were several people waiting for us to arrive
         with the new one. in case you are wondering what it looks
         like, you can go take a look at it .....<BR>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">we spent most of the day
         getting info and interviews, but we still had time to hang
         out with each other. ech, vash, myself, gloom, nova, marril,
         peep toad, scoundrel, and vash's little brother all had a
         pretty good time just talking to each other. marril gave us
         a ton of cards he made. we did manage to squeeze in one
         booster draft over in the side events and that was a lot of
         fun.<BR>
         <BR>
         once the professor draft was over, we went out for dinner.
         lumaga and firefighter095 joined us at the sizzler, and it
         was a nice ending to the day.</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><BR>
         </B></FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">then we went back to the
         crowne plaza for some much needed rest and relaxation. after
         hours play is always nice. we watched dmtm finish up a small
         draft, then played the much anticipated team battle. it was
         a lot of fun! </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">then we went upstairs and
         woke up poor mtm who'd very kindly offered to let us crash
         in his room. in the morning, it was off on a tour of
         airports as we dropped off the mt's one after another. the
         end of another fun event.<BR>
         <BR>
         i have a lot more to say, and a lot more pictures, including
         ones of our friday tour through manhattan, our lunch in
         chinatown, dinner at gasho and friday night fun draft. stay
         tuned for those. eep...guess i should do the writeup from
         the wcsts????<BR>
