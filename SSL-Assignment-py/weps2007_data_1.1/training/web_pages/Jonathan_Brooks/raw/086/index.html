   Three men hit another with car in parking lot<P>   Three men hit another with car in parking lot
<P>   SPRING HILL -- Three men shouted profanities and hit a 26-year-old man with their car in the parking lot of Cumberland Farms on Mariner Boulevard at 6:45 p.m. Sunday, authorities said.
<P>   Jonathon Brooks, 19, told deputies he was standing in the parking lot with Daniel Eicholtz, 26, and Brandy Brooks, 22, all of whom live west of Brooksville, when three men pulled into the parking lot in a silver car and shouted a profanity.
<P>   Jonathan Brooks said he and his friends ignored the comment and the car left, but it later returned. He said the three men got out of the car and circled them. They exchanged words. 
<P>   Brandy Brooks held up a cell phone and said she was calling the police, a report states. The men got back into the car and drove into Eicholtz, who rolled over the hood and punched a car window, shattering it, a report states.
<P>   The men got out of the car and chased Eicholtz, who ran into the store, a report states. They then went after Jonathan Brooks and hit him until he was unconscious, he told authorities.
<P>   Deputies said they saw an injury on his head, which was red and swollen.
<P>   The three friends copied the Michigan license plate number. The three suspects were between 17 and 19, a report states.

<H3>Thief takes money from drugstore safe</H3>

<P>   SPRING HILL -- Authorities are investigating a theft at the Eckerd drugstore on Spring Hill Drive at 11:24 p.m. Saturday.
<P>   Deputies drove to the store after an alarm was activated. The store's front door was unlocked, and inside deputies found the safe opened with three cash register tills laying on the floor, but they still had money in them.
<P>   Deputies said about $2,120 was stolen. The thief stole only the $20s in one of seven cash drawers inside the safe, a report states.
<P>   Managers told deputies that the store also had been hit four or five days earlier.
<P>   Authorities believe someone hid in the back storage room, activated the alarm by walking through the store, took the cash and walked out the front door. The robber apparently knew the safe combination because it was not forced open, authorities said.

<H3>Deputies: Sears employee stole, resold equipment</H3>

<P>   BROOKSVILLE -- A 21-year-old Sears employee confessed to stealing more than $16,000 worth of computers and camcorders from the store since November, authorities said.
<P>   After a Sears employee questioned him about the missing equipment, Harold Louis Barry Jr. of 471 Neal Lane in Spring Hill confessed to stealing it and selling it, a report states.
<P>   On Monday, Barry told a sheriff's deputy that he met a man named "Junior" at a club in Tampa who asked whether he could get equipment for him. Barry said Junior would call him on his cell phone when he wanted something, and they would meet on Dale Mabry Highway for an exchange, a report states.
<P>   Barry said he charged $700 to $800 for a laptop and $100 to $175 for a camcorder. He said his source paid cash for the equipment -- five to 10 camcorders and about eight computers. He said the source drives a 1995 to 1997 black Acura, is out of college, likes computers and hangs out at Hooters, watching as much football as possible, a report states.
<P>   Barry was charged with grand theft and dealing in stolen property. He was held at the Hernando County Jail on Tuesday in lieu of $12,000 bail, a spokeswoman said.

<H3>Property owners sue over assessments</H3>

<P>   BROOKSVILLE -- Owners of a retail strip center and an assisted living facility are suing the Hernando County property appraiser and tax collector to contest their property assessments.
<P>   Millennium Ventures Limited Partnership is contesting the appraisal of a 128-unit assisted living facility that was completed in 2000. The property was assessed at $12,651,768, according to the lawsuit, which calls the assessment "invalid, illegal, excessive, arbitrary and improper."
<P>   Timber Pines Centre Limited Partnership also sued, saying a retail strip center built in 1999 was assessed at $1,976,692 in 2001, which the owners believe is too high. The company appealed the assessment to county officials, who have declined to alter the figure.
