      <p><b>QUALITY CUSTOM CABINETS</b></p>
      <p>Our goal as the Jonathan Brooks House Woodwrights is to build custom
      cabinets uncompromised in both style and quality. We build cabinetry
      with the notable charm reminiscent of eighteenth and nineteenth century
      craftsmanship for contemporary <a href="http://www.brookshousecabinets.com/kitchen">kitchens</a>,
      <a href="http://www.brookshousecabinets.com/library">libraries</a>,
      <a href="http://www.brookshousecabinets.com/bath"> bathrooms</a> and other
      <a href="http://www.brookshousecabinets.com/living"> living spaces</a>.<b>
      
      <p>THE HISTORY BEHIND OUR NAME</b></p>
      
      <p>We searched for a symbol that would convey our approach to building cabinets.
      The Jonathan Brooks House uniquely conveys this sense of timeless beauty
      and quality. Built in 1809 in Burton, Ohio by Jonathan Brooks, a surveyor
      with the Moses Cleveland Party, the house was restored to its original
      splendor in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
      
      <p>Great attention to detail and
      design aesthetics make the Brooks House one of the most authentically
      restored homes in the Ohio Western Reserve. It is from this tradition that 
      we chose our name and endeavor to fulfill our promise of unique style and 
      quality that can be enjoyed in the fine homes of this generation and those
      to come.</p>
