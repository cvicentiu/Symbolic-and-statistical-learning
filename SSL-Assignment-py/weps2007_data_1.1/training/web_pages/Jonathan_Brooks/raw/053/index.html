<h1>Silencing the Living Dead: Folk-Hesychast Historicism in <i>Boris Godunov</i></h1>
<h2>Jonathan Brooks Platt, Columbia University</h2>
<p>In this essay, I examine the philosophical structure of Puškin’s <i>Boris Godunov 
  </i>in dialogue with its Shakespearean model, the double tetralogy of chronicle 
  plays or histories. Following the prevailing revisionist trend in Shakespeare 
  criticism that views the histories not as expositions of the providential grace 
  enjoyed by Elizabethan power, but of the worldly poetics of this power’s construction 
  and perpetuation, contemporary readings of Puškin’s drama have emphasized its 
  transgressive representation of power and its grounding in a constructivist 
  historical consciousness. While much of Puškin’s foray into the Shakespearean 
  tradition does seem to recall Greenblatt <i>avant la lettre</i>, in this paper 
  I suggest that a providentialist perspective nevertheless persists in Puškin’s 
  Romantic tragedy, albeit one distinct from that traditionally found in Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Following Shakespeare, Puškin chooses a succession crisis for the theme of 
  his chronicle play, thus invoking the ultimate historical metaphor for a departure 
  from providential design. Through an analysis of his blurring of the boundary 
  between the realms of the living and the dead in the play, I demonstrate how 
  Puškin, now in contradistinction to Shakespeare, saturates this metaphorical 
  frame with apocalyptic reverberations. The result of this shift of the dramatic 
  focus leads to a further shift from the central Shakespearean preoccupation 
  with judging the true from the false to an opposition of all language, implicated 
  universally in the fallen cosmos, to silence, the only strategy of restoration 
  and return to a state of grace. The resultant providentialism is thus not one 
  of eschatological prediction, promising the advent of the messianic age in the 
  person of a divinely ordained ruler, but of a passive, folk belief in an immutable, 
  divine order to history, static and ultimately resistant to the political overtures 
  of linguistically gifted pretenders (equated with the Antichrist) and accessible 
  only through a posture of radical silence and withdrawal.</p>
