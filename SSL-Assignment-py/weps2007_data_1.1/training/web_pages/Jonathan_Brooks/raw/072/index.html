      <p>This site will be a family tree of the BrooksDowsett lineage. Only members 
        that are older than 100 years or deceased will be included. I will state 
        that the combination of Brooks and Dowsett is unique because every Brooks 
        Dowsett, which has been found have been linked back to the same lineage.</p>
      <p>The name began in Toppesfield in 1811, with the baptism of William Brooks 
        Dowsett. The church baptism record is:</p>
      <p>&quot;Dowsett William Brooks, baseborn son of Elizth Dowsett having been 
        baptised on Septm 1811 was recievd into the congregation Decm 26th 1812&quot;. 
        (ERO D/P 163/1/3) </p>
      <p>The significant point is that the records of baptism in Toppesfield church 
        identify William as "baseborn", a term used to describe an illigitmate 
        child. Williams mother was recorded in the church records as Elizabeth 
        Dowsett. It is reasonable to assume that William's father surname was 
        Brooks and probably a William Brooks.</p>
      <p>The Toppesfield "<a href="http://www.brooksdowsett.co.uk/william1811/wbdrecords.html">overseers of the 
        poor</a>" records for later years, include payment for &quot;travel to 
        Bardfield twice after Mr Brooks money&quot;.</p>
      <p>This site is new and will be built over time to reflect the hundreds 
        of hours already spent on this research. The first <a href="http://www.brooksdowsett.co.uk/william1811/treewb1811.html">William</a> 
        (there is more than one in the lineage) maye well have been adopted by 
        an older sister !, was a cordwainer, one of the first policeman, in the 
        Witham division and Essex (no.75). He became the equivalent of todays 
        Seargent pretty quickly.</p>
      <p>There is a lot more......
