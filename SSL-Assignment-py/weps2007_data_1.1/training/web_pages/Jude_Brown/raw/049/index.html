  As newly-elected Co-Chairs of the Women’s Network, we would like to welcome 
  you to the 19th Annual Spring Luncheon and Women’s Leadership Awards Ceremony. 
  As you know, the previous Chair, Robin Newcomb led this organization for six 
  years and while we have ‘big shoes to fill’ we are confident that with your 
  support, this powerful network will continue to grow and strengthen. We 
  appreciate the opportunity to build on the foundation of our predecessors as 
  we move into our twentieth year. No longer in our teens, we are looking 
  forward to expanding our membership and addressing issues that are of concern 
  to all members of the Hopkins community. </font>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We would like to acknowledge the hard work 
  and dedication of all of the women who laid the groundwork and promoted the 
  growth and expansion of the Women’s Network. We are also grateful for the 
  institutional support from the Hopkins leadership and consider it a privilege 
  to serve such worthwhile organizations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are proud to share, with each and every 
  one of you, our passion in advancing this great endeavor. Most importantly, we 
  hope that you are inspired to contribute your special talents toward enriching 
  the lives of your fellow JHUWN members and campus community. A small 
  commitment to support a good cause can make a big difference in someone’s 
  life. We encourage you to become involved and help us to reinvigorate our 
  Hopkins experience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To quote Maya Angelou on the anniversary of 
  Dr. Levi Watkins’ thirty-fifth year at Hopkins, “How important it is to 
  celebrate our heroes and she-roes!” Help us to not only celebrate our 
  she-roes, but to elevate them to new heights both personally and 
  professionally.</font></p>

<TR><TD><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This past year marks the 18th Anniversary of the Johns Hopkins University Women’s Network (JHUWN)… years of change and growth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The past seven years have been among the most enriching and stirring developments in the history of our organization:  From the change in our name (JHU Women’s Forum, to Hopkins Women’s Network, to JHU Women’s Network); we refocused our mission statement; expanding our active chapters; including more remote campuses; and most significantly the explosive growth of our membership from 180 to well over 4000.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With these seminal changes come the continued opportunities to enable our membership to expand the support network around them, and bring together a community of interest looking out for the welfare and professional development of women in one of the most dynamic and prestigious institutions in the world. Helping our organization come to this stage has been monumental and among the greatest privileges of my career.  As a natural part of organization, the torch of leadership needs to be shared and passed on to a new generation that will steer our community in new directions and to new heights.  My hope is that you will continue to work together and take the steps needed to fulfill the organization’s mission of supporting each other and ensuring our success.   </font></p>  

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For myself, I started volunteering for the JHUWN as an opportunity to expand my skill set and to meet new people… who knew that chapter programs coordinator would lead to the steering committee? Moving to a less visible position in the organization will allow others to take the reigns of leadership. </font></p> 

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, I urge each of you… Take a step within the JHUWN organization and see how you can help shape our community… As for myself, “two roads diverged in a wood, and I – I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.” <sup>1</sup></font></p>

<TR><TD><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This past year marks the 14th Anniversary of The Johns Hopkins University Women's Network.  We have much to be proud of this year.  We have not only expanded the size of our general membership, but also have increased the active participation of our current membership.  We continue to provide numerous opportunities for networking, as well as for personal and professional enrichment, for members of The Johns Hopkins University system.  In addition, we continue to reach out to the community&#150;at&#150;large.  Our campaign for the House of Ruth remains one of our most ambiguous and well&#150;supported initiatives.<P>

Members of The Johns Hopkins Women's Network have made cracks in the "glass ceiling" and have learned to utilize the "old boy's network" to their advantage.  Many of us are providing the rungs for which others shall climb the ladder to greater opportunities.  We have made great strides to reach individual and collective goals, and although great progress has been achieved, we each recognize that there are "...promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep."<sup>1</sup>

<TR><TD><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I joined the JHU Women's Network after being at Johns Hopkins for only one month.  The membership director for the Homewood campus brought me to a meeting the first week I was on campus.  After expressing interest in working on advocacy issues, I was contacted by Jude Brown-Bellamy (chair) and Debra Pearman (immediate past chair) to serve as the Senior Vice-Chair for Advocacy for the Women's Forum.  Even though I was new to campus, I felt that I could bring a different perspective to the organization.  One of the things that I brought to the Women's Forum was change.  We decided to change the name of the organization from the Women's Forum to the Hopkins Women's Network and to update its mission to better reflect the new nature of the organization.</font></p>
 
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have been many rewards of being chairperson of the JHU Women's Network.  I learned to organize committee meetings and to speak in public for the organization.  It was a wonderful experience being able to meet with women at other Hopkins campuses and to meet with the leadership of the university.  It was truly rewarding to see policies that the HWN presented to the senior administration, such as the mentor program and a childcare program, be put into place at the university.  I encourage more women to take a leadership role in the organization.</font></p>

<TR><TD><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially, I joined the HWN because I was attracted by the idea that we could actually do something about the inequities in the University's education, treatment and compensation of female students, faculty and employees as compared to their male counterparts.  I got more involved as I learned more about the issues affecting women at Hopkins, going from campus Advocacy chair to Chair of the whole organization in a few short years.   I met wonderful, strong, talented women along the way.  I learned quite a bit about the way the University worked and the dance that large organizations do to maintain the delicate balance of what is good for one group versus what is good for the organization.<P>

My rewards?  Well, the Women's Forum allowed me the opportunity to work on committees run by top administrators at Hopkins.  I've met with the Provost, the Vice Presidents, and President Brody on a regular basis.  I enjoyed getting to know these people on a more personal level, and getting to know the kinds of attributes and knowledge that got them where they are.  I learned to speak in public, on stage, with cameras rolling.  I learned how to run a committee and get it to take some action without taking forever.  Mostly, I learned just what I could do.  I learned that much more about who I am and the kind of woman I have the potential to be.  That's priceless.
