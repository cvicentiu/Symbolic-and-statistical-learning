    by Mary Zoccola</b></i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jude Brown 
    (5080) recently received the Association of Scientists and Engineers (ASE) 
    <i>Silver Medal Award</i> for his outstanding performance in leading and managing 
    the <i>Virginia</i> Class Propulsor Development Program. The ASE is a professional 
    organization with a membership of more than 400 civilian engineers, scientists 
    and naval officers from the Naval Sea Systems Command and its field activities 
    throughout the United States. The Silver Medal is awarded for continuous outstanding 
    contributions to naval engineering for a period of not less than seven years. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain John 
    Preisel presented the award to Brown. &quot;Over the past eight years, Jude 
    Brown has worked on propulsors for the U.S. Navy, and, in particular, for 
    the <i>Virginia</i> class submarines. A propulsor is part of the propulsion 
    system of a modern submarine, but it is also one of the most complex, technologically-advanced 
    pieces of turbo machinery in our Navy today. It converts tens of thousands 
    of horsepower into thrust, and it does so exceptionally well,&quot; Preisel 
    said.</font></p></td>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He 
    is the leader of this team effort for the Virginia Class of submarines. It 
    is a broad disciplinary team. From early concepts, he has guided some of the 
    best acousticians, hydrodynamicists, structural, material, and production 
    engineers in pursuit of excellence,&quot; Preisel further explained. &quot;The 
    results will frame this key performance parameter for our Navy well into the 
    21st Century. This is quite an achievement.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Brown's 
    performance over the period of this award, from 1992 to the present, has been 
    truly exceptional in terms of scientific challenge and engineering leadership. 
    His technical and management skills, along with his untiring and dedicated 
    effort have been instrumental in successfully producing the quietest propulsor 
    ever designed for a Navy ship. Through his professional engineering acumen 
    and proactive leadership, Brown has provided visionary leadership and insight 
    that will have a lasting impact on the design of submarine propulsor systems 
    well into the 21st Century. Brown's unparalleled success in forming cohesive 
    and successful headquarters, field organization, and industry teaming arrangements 
    have made him highly deserving of this award. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In successfully 
    planning and implementing the <i>Virginia</i> Class Propulsor Development 
    Program, Brown has directed a $120+-million program involving the most difficult 
    engineering challenges critical to meeting the operational requirements of 
    this most advanced class of nuclear attack submarines. For the <i>Virginia</i> 
    Class Program, the propulsor is considered both a component and a major system 
    of the ship. The reason for this is that the propulsor, while a component 
    of the propulsion system, is also a vastly complex engineering system required 
    to meet an array of highly interactive performance parameters. As a result, 
    Brown has been simultaneously responsible for leading both a systems engineering 
    team and a major area team through the planning, research, development, testing 
    and manufacturing phases of the Propulsor Development Program. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brown assumed 
    his leadership role beginning in 1992, coincident with the development of 
    numerous alternative propulsor concepts and led the assessment of their technical 
    performance, associated risks, and development costs. His team's efforts led 
    to the down-selection of the most favorable concept for achieving an assured 
    and well-balanced design for optimally meeting the Virginia Class performance 
    requirements. Brown followed up his initial work by directing the detailed 
    planning of a program to identify and address the complex technical, manufacturing, 
    and systems engineering problems involved. In addition, he worked independently 
    with the full ship’s design team to assure that the propulsor met all interface 
    requirements without compromise to either the ship or the propulsor. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brown was 
    an early leader in the Virginia Class Program's very successful implementation 
    of the integrated process and product design-build philosophy. He did this 
    by incorporating all of the relevant experts, encompassing all technical disciplines, 
    at the beginning of the project with a focus on incorporating design and manufacturing 
    lessons learned from the <i>Seawolf</i> propulsor program. He staffed a multidisciplinary 
    propulsor team with acousticians, hydrodynamicists, structural engineers, 
    materials engineers and production engineers; defined and managed their interfaces; 
    and motivated them to the highest levels of performance. In so doing, Brown 
    engaged the best people available from ten different, sometimes competitive, 
    independent government and private organizations, including shipbuilders, 
    Navy laboratories and private support contractors. He kept the program on 
    schedule, despite evolving technical requirements and parameter changes resulting 
    from the integrated nature of ship design, by applying technical innovations 
    and sound engineering decisions, and by maintaining a focus on detail and 
    program requirements. The program has delivered the design information and 
    manufacturing technology projected to provide a propulsor system that will 
    satisfy technical and programmatic requirements. These requirements include 
    the demanding operational performance needs, shipbuilder's construction schedule 
    and program budgets. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the 
    drawings finalized and the lead-ship <i>Virginia</i> Class propulsor well 
    under construction, Brown is working with the manufacturing community to deliver 
    the propulsor on time and within budget to General Dynamics, Electric Boat. 
    He has been instrumental in resolving key issues and problems that occur and 
    his continued efforts are essential to the successful completion of this project.</font></p>
