<h3>The Battle of Los Angeles</h3>

<p>Don’t look now but the Los Angeles Clippers aren’t only a fun team to watch but thanks to Head Coach Mike Dunleavy Sr. they now know how to win.  While some may not consider the Clips as a contender in the West, yet, it wouldn’t be too far-fetched to lay down some money that they will be the best team playing out of the Staples Center this season.  That’s right Kobe…the Clippers may surpass the Lakers as La-La land’s team!  Just imagine…Jack at courtside screaming for a foul because Elton Brand is getting mauled…Chris Rock’s trademark grin as he screams out after Corey Maggette crowns some poor defender or Dr. Dre sporting the vintage Clips jersey sitting beside his new team’s bench.  Well, I may be getting ahead of myself a little but this young Clippers team has the formula to contend for a long time to come.  </p>

<p>They have just finished up the franchise’s 2nd best November ever, and just the 3rd winning November in their 24-year history.  What’s most impressive is the fact that they finished up the month by winning four games in five nights…once again a testament to both their coaching staff and the pure athleticism of this young team.  This most glaring deficiency in the club may be the lack of savvy veterans because I’m not sure the elder statesmen (Zeljko Rebraca and Rick Brunson, both 32) have what it takes to get the team through a first round playoff series.  Once again only time will tell but you can count on the fact that this team is only going to get bigger, stronger and more confident as each month passes in the season.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong><em>Congratulations to Lebron James for actually exceeding the ridiculous expectations loaded onto him when he began his NBA career.  Recently, James became the youngest player and the quickest to reach 2,000 career points in the league.  It took “Bron-Bron” just 92 games, and at the age of 19 years 272 days he beat the previous record held by Kobe Bryant by almost a full year.   </em>    </strong> <br />

<h3>The True Meaning of "Old School"</h3>

<p>With the recent problems troubling the NBA and its players it could not have come at a worse time that Memphis Grizzlies Head Coach Hubie Brown has been forced into retirement due to illness.  I say that because Hubert Jude Brown is an old-school basketball mind that could somehow still get through to a generation that is more focused on shoe deals and “bling-bling” than good defense and taking a charge.  </p>

<p>Hubie started his coaching career at the High School level spending nine years in Little Falls, New York before moving into the professional ranks as an assistant until he got a shot as the Head Coach of the ABA’s Kentucky Colonels.  There he led the team to their first league championship and the legend of Coach Brown had begun.  He took over the lowly Hawks of the NBA helping them bounce back from a 31 and 51 record to lead his team to the NBA playoffs picking up Coach of the Year honors along the way.  The Hawks made the post-season three times over five seasons with Brown at the helm before he moved onto the Big Apple only to lead that team to two playoff berths over five seasons.  In his spare time Brown took part in coaching clinics throughout the U.S. keeping alive the teachings that he used up until his final game in the NBA.  He was also nominated for a Sports Grammy Award in both 1994 and 1999 as an analyst for a number of different NBA teams.  </p>

<p>Where I fell in love with his style of coaching was when he came out of retirement to take over another weak NBA club in the Memphis Grizzlies.  Brown worked his magic once again taking the Grizz from a 28 and 46 record in 2002 to a 50 and 32 record in 2003 in leading the franchise to their first ever playoff appearance.  Brown helped break many team records, won another NBA Coach of the Year award and more importantly he instilled a winning attitude in a team that was still struggling to find its identity.  And he didn’t do it by giving one star player 30 shots a game…he did it by building a team that used wholesale line changes spreading out both the minutes played and the scoring duties.  In the 2003 season the Grizz had 8 players average over 9 points a game and not one of them averaged above 20.  As a result, these young ballers were not only taught basketball skills they will use for their entire career…but life skills that will carry long beyond their playing days. And just imagine over his 33 years of coaching how many different lives he improved simply by doing what he loved to do.     <br />

<h3>A Stern resolution to a horrible mess</h3>

<p>By now everyone across the world with a television set has seen the <strong>“Madness in the Motor City”</strong> at least once.  I myself have watched it numerous times and I must say…it was simply unbelievable.  I let myself have a couple of days to let it sink in and now here are my thoughts <em>(of course I mixed in plenty of sarcasm.)</em>  First off, this whole thing could have been avoided if Ben Wallace had reacted differently.  No, I’m not blaming <strong>“Big Ben”</strong>…I actually don’t think he did enough.  If he would have hauled off and drilled Artest with a right hand from that massive frame of his nothing else would have occurred because <em>Ron-Ron </em>would still be staring at the lights of the Palace at Auburn Hills.  Artest knew his foul was flagrant, so he bowed his head right away expecting a physical reaction from the man teammates call <strong>“The Body”</strong>…but Wallace basically kept his cool and delivered a solid shove, <em>(probably saving him some legal problems.)</em></p>

<p>What happened next is a perfect example of why I think the NBA was correct in suspending Artest for the rest of the season…because he can snap without a moment’s notice.  He went from lying down on the announce table trying to stay out of trouble…to hurdling reporters and running over fans on his way to get to the guy he thought threw the beverage <em>(with unbelievable accuracy)</em>.  Reportedly, it was Mike Ryan who Artest went after and mauled while asking, “did you do it?”  Now, Ryan repeatedly said it wasn’t him, while getting pummeled until another fan, (possibly the original culprit) hit Artest with another cool beverage.  That’s when he was cold-clocked by Stephen Jackson and all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Supposedly fans were running down from the upper levels to get at the Pacers bad boy and his teammates which is where I start to blame the spectators who helped escalate things to a fever pitch.  Once you run onto the court and/or into the face of an elite athlete whether he has run into the stands or not…you deserve whatever it is you get.  I’m talking about the portly fan in a Pistons uniform who crossed the line and confronted Artest on his was to the locker room.  News reports said his name was Charlie Haddad…but after the shot he received from Artest I don’t he’d even remember his name.  Or the next guy who came running onto the court only to be dealt the biggest blow of the melee courtesy Jermaine O’neal who had a full running start.  I’m not condoning any of these actions whatsoever and I believe the suspensions handed out by the league were needed for a sport that is quickly getting more and more violent as the players get bigger and stronger.  Kid Rock and Chris Chelios were in attendance at the game and even they were taken aback by what transpired.  All in all David Stern hit this one right on the button and I hope he took note of who was in the stands trying to break everything up.  None other than Rasheed Wallace was playing peacemaker in the whole debacle which should prove to everybody that a bad boy can change…except of course, Ron Artest.<br />

<h3>Kid Canada still getting it done in the desert</h3>

<p>What a nice site to see on Tuesday as Steve Nash was welcomed back to Dallas by standing ovations from fans still wearing his #13 Mavericks jersey.  In a day and age where players are booed relentlessly by their former fans for signing elsewhere as a free agent the faithful in big ‘D’ showed their appreciation for <em>Kid Canada </em>and what he did for that franchise.  Of course, dropping 18 dimes while picking up 17 points in a handing their club just their 2nd loss of the season wasn’t quite what they had in mind.</p>

<p>But anybody and everybody that is a fan of basketball has to enjoy watching Nash and the Suns burn up the hardwood.  Against the Mavs they had 4 players rack up double-doubles, Quentin Richardson, Shawn Marion, Nash and Amare Stoudemire, who by the way celebrated just his 22nd birthday on Tuesday.  It’s just scary to think what this team is going to be able to do in the coming years…Stephon Marbury who?  By the way the Knicks are still just horrible to watch, and I love to see it considering who is steering the ship right into the iceberg.</p>

<p>Now, regarding my last post…you know, when I talked about barring any injuries the Mavs are one of the best in the West.  Well, they lost both Jason Terry and Erick Dampier on Tuesday and suddenly the disco ball had a tougher time getting it done.  Let’s just hope both those guys are back sooner than later.</p>

<h3>Disco Dirk continues to roll down in Big 'D'</h3>

<p>Dirk Nowitzki was drafted ninth overall in the 1998 NBA Draft by the Milwaukee Bucks who then traded his and Pat Garrity’s rights to the Mavericks for the draft rights of Robert Traylor.  Just one of your average run of the mill draft trades that works out for both teams involved.  Oh wait a minute…the <em>“tractor trailer” </em>is pulling rigs around Cleveland while Dirk is running the show in Big ‘D’ making the loss of Steve Nash that much more acceptable to Mark Cuban.  The “Disco Ball”, as we at The Score like to call him, has been awesome since he stepped into the league but this season looks to be even more promising.  </p>

<p>Here’s just a taste…Nowitzki is in the top three of scoring, field goals made, points per 48 minutes, defensive rebounds and double-doubles.  Plus, he’s 2nd in the league in free throws and, unlike other big men, he can hit his freebies.  This season he’s 65 for 79 from the charity stripe.  What makes everything even sweeter is that the Mavs are leading the West at 7 and 1 with a great mix of both veteran and young talent.  </p>

<p>Next time you get a chance make sure to check out a Dallas game.  You’ll see Nowitzki draw out a 7-footer and drop a long deuce over him…next trip down the floor he’ll come off a screen and drop a 3-pointer.  Then off the fastbreak you’ll see the crazy-haired German throw down a jam on the run while getting fouled…and yes he’ll make the <br />
3-point play.  Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of star players in the league that can do all of the above on a nightly basis…they’re just not 7-feet tall and guard the other teams big man.  What makes matters worse for the Mavs opponents on any given night is the fact that the man can pass...and with scorers like Jerry Stackhouse and Michael Finley on the wings double teaming is not an option.  As long as Dallas stays healthy and their bench can give them some decent minutes I’d put my money on the Mavs for a Western Conference Final berth…then we’ll see if Tim Duncan can take a little shine off that disco boogie.</p>

<p><em><strong>Just a fact: The Raptors are the only team in the league right now without a player in the top-50 of scoring</strong></em>.  <br />

<h3>Welcome Skip and Sam...make yourselves right at home</h3>

<p>I know we’re still extremely early in a very long NBA season but allow me to sing the praises of this edition of the Toronto Raptors.  I don’t care if they go winless on their massive west coast swing, their start to the season has been exactly what they, Vince Carter and the Toronto fans need.  Let’s start with the most obvious reason they’re playing with more energy, Rafer Alston.  When the Raptors signed Skip on a series of 10-day contracts and he showed the type of pressure defense and high-octane offence he possesses they should have signed him to a 2-year deal on the spot.  The cost?  Probably a Hyundai Accent, some fresh gear and a promise of at least using him as your back-up point guard. Instead, he went to Miami, became the only guy on the team to play in all 82 games and set a new NBA record for consecutive games making a 3-point attempt.  As a result the Raptors found themselves as one of many teams in the hunt to get Rafer’s name on a contract but luckily he loved his first trip around in the T-dot so much the Raps have themselves their first <em>“true”</em> point guard since Mighty Mouse was flying around the Skydome.  And with that fat contract Alston has probably got that Accent with the heated leather seats and a big ‘ol pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear view.  Seriously though, I can’t think of a nicer guy who has worked harder for what he has than the NYC playground legend himself.  </p>

<p>So who do you think pushed for a floor general that never seems to tire or slow down?  Me thinks new bench boss Sam Mitchell with his rebound and run mentality was a big part of bringing Rafer back to town (although I’m sure Mr. Babcock was also a huge fan).  Mitchell has been exactly what the doctor ordered.  With word spreading around the league that the Raps were once again an organization without a clue Toronto needed a coach they could hang their hat on for more than a season.  With the respect from his players, since he himself was one of them, and his <em>“father-like”</em> teachings Mitchell already has a leg-up on his predecessor.  Plus, the new coach likes playing his 5 starters to open a game then having a full-scale switch to see what he has to pick from on his bench.  The Memphis Grizzlies have had a huge amount of success playing that same style and if you have ever watched one of their games…it’s some of the most exciting in the league.  And what makes Toronto even better at it is that four of the Raps second five have all started in the NBA at some point.  With depth comes victories…and as long as your bench players are in as good shape as your starters, it won’t even seem like your resting your top guys.  Plus, Mitchell simply fits the bill…from his style in dress to his calm demeanor on the court the Raptors not only have themselves their point guard of the future…they also have the face of their team for years to come.<br />

<h3>B-Ballin' and Shot Callin'...thank God for the NBA!!!</h3>

<p>After the first few weeks of the NBA season I feel the same way I do every year…this is going to be the best regular season yet.  During the off-season I kept up with who was traded where and who signed with who but until you see ballers in their new jersey’s it never really quite sinks in.  T-mac in a Rocket’s uniform…just plain weird.  K-mart in the Nuggets baby blue…it’ll take a while but once he starts eating some rim I’ll warm up to it.  “Kid Canada” Steve Nash with the Suns…it’s like he never left.  </p>

<p>Last Wednesday night was a treat for any roundball fan who was sitting at home on the couch with the converter in his or her hand.  At around 9:20pm you could have watched Loren Woods throw down a huge 2-hander to seal the deal for the Raptors over the tired as hell Rockets.  Then you could have flipped it over to The Score’s best show, Court Surfing, to catch a blast from the past mixed with the future.  First it was the return of Grant Hill, who has played a total of 47 games over the last four seasons, hitting a baseline fadeaway to give the Magic a 1-point lead.  Next up, producer Jay Sands flips you over to the Cavs/Pacers game just in time to catch LeBron James drill a 3-ball to tie the game and send it into overtime.  Not done, next we flip back to the Magic/Bucks where Orlando is down by one with 3 seconds to go and who else but Stevey Franchise drives and finishes things off with a last-second lay-in before running the length of the court displaying his new team’s colors.</p>

<p>Now I know this is still early in the season but if things keep up at this pace I’m not even going to miss hockey.  Speaking of over-paid players complaining too much, did any of you see McGrady’s attitude near the end of the Toronto season opener?  Woods, who I agree has done nothing in his NBA career to warrant any cockiness, just finished battling for a rebound and after getting fouled T-Mac gets right in front of him and starts asking “Who do you think you are man.”  That’s when everyone started crowding around and unfortunately the cameras never picked up anything more.  The reason this bothers me?  I find it amazing that McGrady gets the trade he wants (after leading his former team into the cellar of the NBA), signs a multi-million dollar contract extension and he feels he has the right to trash talk a guy that knows that this his last kick at the can in the league?  I love this game…but not the childhood antics that are becoming more and more prevalent in the association.  I guess that’s what happens when 26-year-old’s are actually considered veterans since they’ve been in the league for 8 years.  I think veterans should earn their title based on their mentality and maturity and not on the amount of years of service in the league.</p>
