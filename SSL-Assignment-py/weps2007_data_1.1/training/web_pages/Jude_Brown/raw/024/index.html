<h3 class="title"><i>Captain Harold E. Saunders Award</i> Presented to Jude Brown</h3>

<p><i>Source:  Nomination Package</i></p>

<p>WEST BETHESDA—Jude Brown (5080) received the <i>Captain Harold E. Saunders Award</i> for his contributions to the <i>Virginia</i> Class design-build program.  The <i>Saunders Award</i> recognizes exemplary achievements in leading a major technical organization component or managing a complex technical project.</p>

<p>Brown coordinated and managed all of the Division’s efforts on the <i>Virginia</i> Class Propulsor Development Program.  In performing the management function, he developed the technical plan including the technical strategy, directed and coordinated the technical effort, analyzed the resources necessary to achieve technical goals together with recommendations to NAVSEA PMS 450 for changes, prepared program funding requirements, and presented periodic briefings to the Division, NAVSEA, and OPNAV.  He had the authority to program funds within the context of the program plan, as agreed upon with NAVSEA PMS 450, and to establish priorities as necessary to meet stated technology objectives within available time and funding constraints.  He directed or personally conducted analyses of propulsor performance improvements resulting from advanced hull, appendage, and propulsor features proposed for use on the <i>Virginia</i> Class.</p>

<p>Brown was an early leader in the <i>Virginia</i> Class Program’s very successful implementation of the integrated process and product design-build philosophy.  He did this by incorporating all of the relevant experts, encompassing all technical disciplines, at the beginning of the project, with a focus on incorporating manufacturing lessons learned from the <i>Seawolf</i> propulsor program.  He staffed a multidisciplinary propulsor team with acousticians, hydrodynamicists, structural engineers, materials engineers, and production engineers; defined and managed their interfaces; and motivated them to the highest levels of performance.  In so doing, Brown engaged the best people available from 10 different, sometimes competitive, independent government and private organizations, including shipbuilders, Navy laboratories, and private support contractors.</p>

<p>He kept the <i>Virginia</i> Class Propulsors Program on schedule, despite evolving technical requirements and parameter changes resulting from the integrated nature of ship design, by applying technical innovations and sound engineering decisions, and by maintaining a focus on detail and program requirements.  Because this program was charged with developing a propulsor with requirements more stringent than ever applied to a submarine, the program had to remain flexible to incorporate evolving research, knowledge, and ship schedules.  As difficult as it is to design a complex propulsor, Brown’s team had to design a propulsor for a ship whose very design was changing and is projected to keep changing.  Through regular meetings and constant communication with the multi-disciplined design-build community over approximately 10 years, he ensured that the program’s plans and execution evolved rapidly and seamlessly to meet the evolving technical issues, results, and programmatic needs.</p>

<p>Brown’s efforts resulted in customer satisfaction.  The customer required a propulsor that met its requirements to be delivered to the shipyard on time. At the start of the program, it was not known how to meet the conflicting requirements that the Navy imposes on a submarine propeller.  Technology that was beyond the state of the art was required and unprecedented cooperation between shipbuilders, propeller manufacturers, NAVSEA, and the R&D community were required.  Brown assembled and maintained the technical staff, presented and defended his team’s approaches to senior Navy leadership, mustered administrative and fiscal support for his team and program, and 10 years later, delivered the propulsor on time to the shipyard.  In an era of declining budgets and staff, Brown was a steady hand, who earned the customer’s trust, maintained a team for a decade, and delivered its product.</p>
