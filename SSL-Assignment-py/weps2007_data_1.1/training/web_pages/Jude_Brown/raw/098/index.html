 Entire families are among the hundreds of people signing up eagerly
to join the Georgian Supporters' Club, which the POST has arranged as
part of the Rugby World Cup round being held at Subiaco Oval.</P>

<P>This week, the POST sent two supporters' kits to a couple in
Canada as well as to supporters in Hong Kong, NSW, Queensland and
South Australia.</P>

<P>And five members of the Brown family, of West Perth, arrived as a
group sporting their Georgia on My Mind caps.</P>

<P>"We were really taken with the idea of supporting the children in
hospital in Georgia and at PMH," said Jude Brown, mother of four
daughters.</P>

<P>"And we're all for the underdogs. We wanted to get involved in the
Rugby World Cup. Australia is not playing here, so we're backing
Georgia."</P>

<P>The Georgian players are truly underdogs for the Cup series -
bookmakers quoted the team at 20,000:1 this week to win the title,
and they are rated 17th in the world rankings, up from 18th.</P>

<P>The unpaid team members from the economically-wrecked former
Soviet state on the Black Sea are looking forward to arriving here on
October 1, "poor but proud".</P>

<P>David Reble and Malaka Hendela, from Ottawa, signed in on the POST
website.</P>

<P>"We were looking at the World Cup online and found your
supporters' club," David said.</P>

<P>"We can't be in Australia for the festivities, but joining the
club let us support the Georgian team and become involved in the
event in a more connected way than just watching the games on TV.</P>

<P>"Best of luck to your Supporters' Club and the Georgian
Lelos."</P>

<P>You can join the Supporters' Club for $20, $10 of which will help
children in hospitals here and in Georgia (see letter page 2).</P>

<P>Each Supporters' Club member gets a cap with the Georgia colours,
a certificate and their name placed in a draw for 10 sets of two free
seats at the Georgia v England game at Subiaco Oval on Sunday,
October 12.</P>

<P>Australian Rugby Union has weighed in with more support for the
club, donating a set of tickets for all five games, including the
sold-out England v South Africa, whose tickets are being offered by
scalpers for $5000.</P>

<P>These will be auctioned separately by the Princess Margaret
Hospital Foundation. Watch the POST for details.</P>

<P>Fun supporters' functions have been organised for each Wednesday
evening, starting on September 17, at Clancy's Fish Pub in the
Subiaco Village complex (the site of the old Henry Africa's tavern,
opposite Waldecks) and on match day.</P>

<P>All Georgian supporters and their friends are welcome to the
sunshine hour from 6 to 7pm, and memberships can be obtained on the
night.</P>

<P>The first night will be to meet fellow Georgia supporters and
practise the war chant "Lelo, Lelo Sakartvelo".</P>

<P>The Georgia team is nicknamed "Lelos, sons of the sun" because of
the sunburst design on their logo.</P>

<P>The chant urges the team to score a try.</P>

<P>Most of the Georgian squad of 40 play professional rugby in
France.</P>

<P>Last weekend, Georgia played Italy in Asti in Italy - Italy won
32:23 after two of the Georgians were "sin binned".</P>

<P>The Georgian team includes a TV celebrity, prop Levan Tsabadze,
who competed in the Greco-Roman wrestling in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney.</P>

<P>Big Levan is known in Georgia by the nickname Leoncio after a
burly mansion-keeper from a Brazilian TV soap.</P>

Caucasian race, see page XX</P>
