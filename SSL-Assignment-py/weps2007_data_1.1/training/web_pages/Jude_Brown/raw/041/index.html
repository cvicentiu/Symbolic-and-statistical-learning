Deputy Secretary, U.S. Treasury Department<br>
December 28, 2005<br>
Everly-Wheatley Funeral Home<br>
Alexandria Virginia</p>

<p align="justify">On February 3<sup>rd</sup> of this year, I was among those privileged to attend Reggie Brown’s retirement party at the 
Army-Navy Country Club in Arlington.  What a joyous evening that was, with not just good food and drink, but also healthy doses 
of the faith, family, and friends that symbolized the life of dedicated service we honored that evening.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus, it was quite a shock when Emmy called me last week with the news of Reggie’s death.  But she softened the blow by 
asking if I would give a brief remembrance to help celebrate the life of the husband, father, grandfather, friend, and 
soldier/serviceman we honor again today, at the spiritual retirement ceremony our heavenly Father has waiting for us all.</p>

<p align="justify">Of course, I immediately said yes to Emmy – how can anyone say no to that smiling face and sweet voice? – but in so doing I 
knew I would have to reveal a secret Reg and I kept between us and smiled about often for almost forty years: that the current 
Deputy Secretary of the Treasury received his lowest grade at West Point in Economics 101, taught by a newly-minted Harvard 
MBA graduate named Reginald J. Brown.  Fortunately, I seem to have retained far more of what Reggie taught me than I was able 
to convey years ago during daily recitations on Paul Samuelson’s epic <i>Economics</i> text.  That semester’s encounter with 
Reg in a windowless room of Thayer Hall launched both a professional and personal relationship that spanned decades of service 
together both in and out of uniform.</p>

<p align="justify">Reg was a proud member of the West Point Class of 1961 – whose motto was “Second to None.  Only 534 of the original 741 
members of the Class – Reg high among them – received their diplomas from then-Vice President Lyndon Johnson on June 7, 1961.  
That was two months before the Berlin Wall went up; 15 months before the Cuban Missile Crisis; two years before President 
Kennedy’s assassination; and four years before regular Army units went into Vietnam.  What an era was just beginning.</p>

<p align="justify">After Reggie completed a decade of dedicated uniformed service as an Airborne Ranger in the United States, Korea, and in 
combat in Vietnam – the proud unit patches at the foot of the casket tell that story – he commenced a distinguished career in 
a wide variety of civilian service positions, including the Defense Manpower Commission, the President’s Commission on Military 
Compensation, the Office of Wage and Price Stability, and the Congressional Budget Office.  After a stint in the private 
sector, including service as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies – or, as it was sometimes 
known, “Social Sciences Department South” – Reg returned to government service in 1989 as Assistant Administrator of the 
Agency for International Development under the first President Bush and Secretary of State Jim Baker.  It was my great honor 
while serving as Undersecretary of State to swear Reg in to this important position – and Reg was diplomatic enough that day to 
mention in his remarks only our West Point connection and not economics grades.  Reg’s service was absolutely superb during the 
four years of the first Bush Administration, which saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union that so 
dominated the Army that Reg had entered over 30 years before.</p>

<p align="justify">After another successful tour in the private sector, Reg returned to government as Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Manpower &amp; Reserve Affairs in 2001.  As you have heard and will hear, he was the exact right man for that critical 
position during the Army’s swiftest personnel transformation ever after terrorists hit his troops – literally and figuratively – 
on September 11, 2001.  As a reservist mobilized shortly after that fateful day, I both saw and benefited from Reg’s 
unparalleled knowledge of and care for the Army and its people.  And even in the midst of the ‘round-the-clock schedule he kept, 
Reg never hesitated to take time for others – always for his beloved family but also including treating my Dad and me to lunch 
after the two of them had met at a dinner.  When my Dad, a retired Army Colonel, died less than 6 months later, he had in his 
pocket the Army coin Reg had given him that day at lunch.</p>

<p align="justify">Reggie Brown began a life of service by raising his right hand on the Plain at West Point in the summer of 
1957, and I am but one of the legions of people whose lives he touched and whose careers he inspired.  The poem entitled “If” 
by Rudyard Kipling has some passages that capture this life of service we celebrate today:</p>

<p align="center"><i>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you<br><br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two imposters just the same<br><br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue<br>
Or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch<br><br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p align="justify">The earth was certainly Reggie Brown’s, and now so much more.</p>

<p align="justify">Well done, Soldier.  Be thou at peace.</p>

</font><font face="Verdana">Delivered by COL Tony Stamilio '74</p>

</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
       

<P align="justify">Good Morning.  I am honored that Emmy asked me to speak about my relationship with Reggie as colleague and co-worker.  I 
only hope that I can do justice to this tribute on behalf of the many soldiers and civilian employees with whom Reggie worked, 
and who will honor his memory.  I am sure that I could have done some research, and have prepared an eloquent talk highlighting 
the accomplishments of Reginald Brown, and his lasting contributions to our nation.  However, this morning I would like to 
talk about my personal observations and recollections about the time I spent with Reggie.</p>

<P align="justify">I remember the first time that we met.  It was early the Spring in 2002.  I was stationed in Germany, serving soldiers as a 
commander.  I was asked to come to Washington to interview for the position as Executive Officer for the Assistant Secretary of 
the Army.  I was not particularly enamored with the thought of returning to the Pentagon for a THIRD sentence, now serving with 
soldiers in the field after 5 years on staff, I certainly did not care about going to work for some “suit.”  So my interview 
strategy was to try to be as opinionated as possible, and when I ended with “if you hire me, you will have to put up with me 
speaking my mind”…the answer was “you are hired.”&nbsp; I knew at that moment that I was probably in trouble.</p>

<P align="justify">Once in the job, I clearly came to understand, that I was not working for some “garden variety” presidential appointee.  
As you all know, Reggie Brown was a man of incredible intellect and dedication, who accepted his authority and responsibility 
to the Army with solemn commitment.  Reggie Brown made it his business to be well informed about every issue, so that he 
could make the right decision for the Army and the soldiers.  This combination made for some interesting times as Reggie dealt 
with commanders, staff officers, and civilian managers across the Army.</p>

<P align="justify">LTC Steve Apland, one of Reggie’s Military Assistants, was called upon
frequently to assistant his boss in preparing for meetings and conferences. <span
   </span>Initially, Steve would provide some very broad
responses to requests for information on Army units and organizational
capabilities from his boss.  It did not
take long for Steve to understand, that a general answer was not what the
Secretary was looking for.  Graduating
number one in his class in Military History, Reggie leveraged that background
with his own curiosity and “homework,” so when he asked Steve a question, he
already knew most of the general background on the subject…Steve had to adjust
his approach. Reggie was equally prepared in the financial arena.<span
    </span>&nbsp; Some of the most interesting conversations
about a budget topic often started with a question by the Secretary that
started with a statement that went something like this:&nbsp; </span>“When you 
were here 6 months ago on this topic, you told me that number was X, NOT the 
number you showed me today.” </p>

   </span>

<P align="justify">

Each of these potentially uncomfortable encounters with the Secretary
were handled in the most positive and professional manner, motivating each of
us to do better, so we would not let the boss down.</font><span
    </span><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; Reggie was a man we wanted to serve.</p>

<P align="justify">

I would like to mention briefly two anecdotes that illustrate Reggie Brown’s 
commitment to doing the right thing by soldiers and the right thing for the 
Army. During my tenure with him, this was often a very delicate balance to 
strike.</p>

<P align="justify">

First, as a part of his duties, Reggie decided on cases of soldiers
requesting some re-consideration for adverse personnel actions, such as
involuntary separation from the Army and even clemency for those in confinement.&nbsp; Not one of these decisions was ever a “rubber
stamp” of a chain of command recommendation, as LTC Butch Alexander will
attest.  Butch is the staff officer
through whom many of these requests flowed.&nbsp; When called into the Secretary’s Office, Butch knew he would not have to
brief on the case, because Secretary Brown would have already studied it.&nbsp; A meeting of this sort was to help Reggie
deliberate, and decide on an issue that would impact the life of a soldier, his
or her family, and the institution.  An
individual soldier’s request was never dealt with in a matter of fashion.</p>

<P align="justify">

As the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Brown was the official empowered to
mobilize reserve units and soldiers for the Global War on Terrorism.&nbsp; Recognizing the Army’s urgent need to
mobilize Reserve and National Guard units for duty in the war, Secretary Brown
never forgot that there was a person attached to that duffle bag, and generally
a family and an employer to consider.  Secretary
Brown knew that with a stroke of his pen, he was going to influence thousands
of lives—sometimes with the most serious consequences.&nbsp; Mr. Dan Denning, MG Pete Chiarelli, and Mr.
Bob Smiley spent many nights trying to answer the question… ”Please tell me why
this unit and all of its soldiers cannot receive 30 days notice before they
have to go off to war?”</p>

<P align="justify">

I only had the opportunity to serve with Reggie Brown for a short 14
months.&nbsp; In his capacity as Assistant
Secretary, there are many more that served with him longer.&nbsp; Certainly across the Army, there were more
that he influenced by his decisions.  One
thing that we all have in common is that for short periods or long, through
personal contact, or as a result of a policy decision, there are thousands
across the Army who have positively been touched by Reggie Brown.</p>

<P align="justify">

I returned to the Pentagon somewhat reluctantly to work for “a
suit.”  I am honored and humbled to be standing
here trying to memorialize the tremendous work of a truly gifted and dedicated
public servant, who contributed enormously to our Army.&nbsp; We salute a great man who has the heart of a
soldier.</p>

   say a few words at my father’s service, I thought back to that day.&nbsp; My dad 
   delivered the eulogy for Pop that day and it was eloquent, moving and 
   mesmerizing.&nbsp; One of my mother’s close friends who was in attendance said to 
   my mother afterward, “Wow! &nbsp;I sure hope Regi can speak at my funeral.”.&nbsp; You 
   see, among his many other gifts, Dad was an accomplished public speaker, a 
   skilled orator who had been captain of the debate team at West Point.&nbsp; Those 
   of you who have heard him speak in a public setting know exactly what I am 
   talking about. </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Well, here I am 18 
   years to the day after my Pop’s funeral standing in the same shoes that my 
   father stood in on that day in 1987 and, dad, I’ve got to tell you, “You left 
   some mighty big shoes to fill”.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for those of you in 
   attendance today, I am not the polished orator that my father was.&nbsp; But, I 
   guess I will have to do.&nbsp; You’re gonna have to put up with me for a few 
   minutes while I talk about my dad.&nbsp;</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There is something 
   special about the way that a son idolizes his father and this son standing 
   before you is no exception.&nbsp; We sons certainly look up to and respect our 
   mothers as well, but with our fathers it is different.&nbsp; Not only do you look 
   up to and respect your father, but you also aspire to grow up to be just like 
   him.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">When I was young, my 
   father was larger than life to me. &nbsp;I felt so much pride and admiration for 
   him.&nbsp; Really, I was in awe of him. &nbsp;He cut such a striking presence, the 
   soldier, the West Pointer, the army ranger.&nbsp; I was five years old the 
   year that my dad was stationed in Vietnam and I remember playing soldier, 
   pretending to be him.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Well, here I am today, 
   41 years old and I realize that I have never stopped being that little boy 
   looking up to his father with a sense of awe and reverence.&nbsp; When he was 
   sworn in as Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs 
   in August, 2001 – I felt the same mix of admiration and pride.</span></p>

   aware of my dad’s distinguished career in public service and his many 
   professional accomplishments.&nbsp; The same defining characteristics observed by 
   those who knew him professionally were also evidenced in his private life.&nbsp; 
   He did not put on airs.&nbsp; What you saw is what you got.&nbsp; And what you got was 
   a man of great honor and integrity, a man who was not concerned with taking 
   the easy path, but with taking the right path.&nbsp; He was not a complicated man 
   in many ways.&nbsp; He was straightforward and didn’t believe in short cuts.&nbsp;
   </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He saw things in a 
   certain way.&nbsp; I remember watching football games with him as a young child.&nbsp; 
   It would infuriate him to no end when a punt returner or running back would 
   run sideways with the ball, “east-west”, trying to run around defenders.&nbsp; Dad 
   was a “north-south” guy.&nbsp; Get the ball and run straight up the field, 
   directly towards the goal line.&nbsp; If anyone is in your way, meet them head on, 
   don’t try to run from them or go around them.&nbsp; </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I imagine that was much 
   the same approach that he took against his opponents when he boxed at West 
   Point and was undefeated with 10 wins and one draw, the one draw being 
   against a much taller man.&nbsp; My father was not large in stature.&nbsp; 
   When he graduated from West Point, he was all of about 135 lbs.&nbsp; But 
   what he lacked in physical size, he made up for in heart and intelligence and 
   determination.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">As a child, I remember 
   my dad telling me about a man named Bill Deuel who was a fellow member of the 
   Class of 61 at West Point.&nbsp; When they were at West Point the cadets would 
   sometimes go on field exercises which could involve walking long distances.&nbsp; 
   When they were out on a field exercise, someone would have to carry the 
   machine gun which was quite heavy. &nbsp;My dad described how this big fellow, I 
   think he may have been an Army football player, got fatigued carrying the 
   heavy machine gun and could not handling lugging it over the long distances 
   they were traveling.&nbsp; He told me how Bill Deuel, who was another little guy 
   like my dad, a gymnast, took the machine gun from the much larger man and 
   carried it along with his own gear for the duration of the exercise and never 
   got tired or needed help.&nbsp; I could tell that Bill Deuel’s strength of will 
   and determination impressed my dad.&nbsp; And my dad was a pretty hard man to 
   impress.&nbsp; </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On September 30, 1966 
   while serving as a battalion advisor in the Republic of Vietnam, hostile fire 
   claimed Bill’s life.&nbsp; Bill is interred at the West Point cemetery where 
   my father will be buried tomorrow.&nbsp; I know that dad will be proud to be 
   laid to rest with Bill and the many other valiant men who are buried there.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It was the sort of 
   determination described in these stories from and about my father that helped 
   spur my dad from his modest beginnings in a housing project in Richmond, 
   California to student body president of his high school to his congressional 
   appointment to West Point and all of the accomplishments that followed.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I know that my father 
   had a deep and abiding appreciation for the gift of life. He had a knowledge 
   that true peace and contentment must come from within one’s self and cannot 
   be found through the attainment of material possessions or outward 
   achievements.&nbsp; In talking to him when he first found out about his 
   illness, he shared with me that he was at peace and that he would be okay, no 
   matter what the outcome.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I have just a few words 
   for my family:</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Mom, dad told me more 
   than once during his illness that he did not know what he would do without 
   you.&nbsp; That applies not just to these past few months but to the 42 years 
   that the two of you were together.&nbsp; You were the love of his life and he 
   was a very lucky man to have you and he knew that.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Denise, I know that 
   this has been a difficult time for you and that you have taken this hard, but 
   I hope there is some small solace in knowing how much dad appreciated 
   everything you did for him during his last months.&nbsp; I saw a closeness 
   between the two of you that touched me as I watched you care for him.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Ethan, I know my sister 
   is grateful for the support that you have provided to her during this time.&nbsp; </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Just as I am grateful 
   to my wife, Kelley, for her support.&nbsp; Kelley, thanks for holding down 
   the fort at home those days that I drove straight to the hospital from work 
   and did not get home until late.&nbsp; Days when you were with the baby all 
   day and then had to take care of her all evening as well with no relief.&nbsp; 
   Thanks for getting on me about seeing my dad when I was taking it for granted 
   that he would be around longer and assuming that he still had a good 6 to 9 
   months left.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   A<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">nd, Monique, Shannon, 
   Danny, Kelley and Alexa, grandpa loved you all very much and cherished the 
   time that he was able to spend with you. </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   A<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> friend of mine sent 
   me a note of condolence this week.&nbsp; In his note, he mentioned that he 
   still thinks about his dad every single day, even 15 years after his passing.&nbsp; 
   After reading his note, it struck me that while we are saying goodbye today, 
   that I will carry my father with me forever. &nbsp;A part of him will always be 
   with me. The lessons he taught me, the influence he had on me, his wisdom and 
   advice, all of these things will persist.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dad, we love you and 
   will miss you terribly.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
   <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Thank you.</span></p>

<P align="justify">I AM PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON AND SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT REGINALD JUDE BROWN.&nbsp; REGGIE 
BROWN IS MY FRIEND.&nbsp; ON THE SECOND OF JULY1957 WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE SALLYPORT TO ENTER WEST POINT, HE WASN’T THE 
FIRST CADET I MET.&nbsp; AT THE END OF THAT LONG FIRST DAY AFTER THE CLASS OF 1961 HAD PLEDGED TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 
UNITED STATES, REGGIE AND I TALKED OF OUR ANXIETIES OF BEING AT WEST POINT AND WHAT MAY LIE AHEAD OF US.&nbsp; REGGIE WAS MY 
ROOMMATE FOR THOSE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF BEAST BARRACKS.&nbsp; AS TEENAGERS AND VERY YOUNG ADULTS, WE WERE SIDE BY SIDE LEARNING 
IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES AND LAYING DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. </p>

<P align="justify">SOMEWHERE TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF BEAST BARRACKS, I CAME TO KNOW MR. SHEETS, THE BRIGADE SERGEANT MAJOR WHO HAD 
OBSERVED ME NAPPING IN A MILITARY CLASS.&nbsp; MR. SHEETS INVITED ME TO STOP BY HIS ROOM AFTER DINNER,&nbsp; I DISCUSSED THIS 
WITH REGGIE AND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR ME BUT AGREED THAT IT WASN’T GOING TO BE GOOD! </p>

<P align="justify">I REPORTED TO MR. SHEETS AT THE APPOINTED HOUR AND WAS INFORMED THAT HE WANTED TO CONDUCT A UNIFORM 
FORMATION.&nbsp; THIS MEANT THAT HE WOULD TELL ME IN WHAT UNIFORM I WAS TO REPORT AND THAT I WOULD DO SO WITHIN A SPECIFIED 
AMOUNT OF TIME.&nbsp; MR. SHEETS’ ROOM WAS IN THE FAR CORNER OF CENTRAL AREA AND MY AND REGGIE’S ROOM WAS IN THE SOUTH MOST 
CORNER OF SOUTH AREA.&nbsp; I WAS TOLD THE FIRST UNIFORM AND AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BY WHEN I MUST RETURN TO MR. 
SHEETS’ ROOM IN THAT UNIFORM.&nbsp; AS I FRANTICALLY DASHED INTO OUR ROOM, I INFORMED REGGIE AS TO WHAT I HAD TO DO WHILE 
CHANGING MY UNIFORM.&nbsp; AT THAT TIME WE HAD BEEN ISSUED APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN DIFFERENT UNIFORMS OR UNIFORM COMBINATIONS. 
I HURRIEDLY THREW ON THE REQUIRED UNIFORM, REGGIE CHECKED THAT I HAD IT RIGHT AND DASHED BACK TO MR. SHEETS MAKING IT JUST IN 
TIME AND WAS GIVEN THE NEXT &nbsp;UNIFORM TO WEAR AND TIME IN WHICH TO RETURN.&nbsp; WHEN I GOT BACK TO OUR ROOM, REGGIE HAD 
ALL OF MY UNIFORMS LAID OUT IN ORDER SO THAT I COULD MORE SPEEDILY MAKE THE REQUIRED CHANGE.&nbsp; THANKS TO REGGIE’S 
FORESIGHT 
AND THE TEAMWORK WE HAD DEVELOPED, I WAS ABLE TO MAKE ALL OF THE REQUIRED UNIFORM CHANGES WITHIN THE TIME LIMITS GIVEN.&nbsp; 
REGGIE IS MY FRIEND! </p>

<P align="justify">REGGIE DID WELL ACADEMICALLY GRADUATING HIGH IN OUR CLASS.&nbsp; HE WAS ALSO A MILITARY LEADER AND SERVED ON 
THE BATTALION STAFF OUR FIRST CLASS YEAR.&nbsp; HOWEVER, REGGIE’S ACHILLES HEEL WAS SWIMMING.&nbsp; ALL CADETS HAD TO PASS 
BASIC SWIMMING SURVIVAL SKILLS IN ORDER TO GRADUATE.&nbsp; REGGIE WAS NOT A SWIMMER AND DID NOT PASS SURVIVAL SWIMMING WITH 
MOST OF THE CLASS.&nbsp; AS A RESULT, HE WAS INVITED FOR EXTRA INSTRUCTION THAT HAD TO BE CARVED OUT OF TIME THAT WOULD 
OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON ACADEMICS OR OTHER CADET ACTIVITIES.&nbsp; REGGIE JOINED WHAT WAS EUPHEMISTICALLY KNOWN AS THE “ROCK 
SQUAD”.&nbsp; IMAGINE MY SURPRISE YEARS LATER TO BE INVITED BY REGGIE AND EMMY TO JOIN THEM FOR A SAIL ON THE CHESAPEAKE 
BAY.&nbsp; MY WIFE, GINNA, AND I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SAILING IN THE 
CARIBBEAN OCEAN WITH REGGIE AT THE HELM.&nbsp; REGGIE 
ENJOYED BEING ON THE WATER OR WATCHING THE WATER BUT NOT BEING IN THE WATER.&nbsp; HE EMBRACED ADVERSITY AND TURNED IT TO HIS 
PURPOSE.&nbsp; REGGIE IS MY FRIEND.&nbsp;&nbsp; REGGIE IS A BATTLE TESTED SOLDIER, A BUSINESSMAN, A STATESMAN AND A 
FRIEND.&nbsp; HIS IMPACT HAS BEEN WIDE AND HIS INFLUENCE HAS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MANY PEOPLE.&nbsp; I KNOW THESE STATEMENTS TO 
BE TRUE.&nbsp; AS I SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY REGGIE’S INFLUENCE IS IN MY CHARACTER AND IN MY BEING AND WILL REMAIN WITH ME ALWAYS.</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">We are here, today, to celebrate the life 
   of an extraordinary gentleman, our friend, Reggie Brown.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">His life was powerfully shaped by his 
   family and by </span>
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
 font-family:Verdana">West Point</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">. He brought great qualities of heart and 
   mind to this place. And, here, he found the great credo of service that would 
   frame his life; Duty, Honor, Country.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Reggie was a soldier and a scholar; a 
   combat infantryman and an expert on public management.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">I first met Major Brown when I was 
   assigned to his Economics Section as a Yearling. He was a very talented 
   teacher, but I was just a fair student of economics at that time. However, 
   time and election to the Senate teamed to transform me into one of his best 
   students or so Reggie claimed at his confirmation hearings.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">I recall him then as a bright and 
   sympathetic young officer. And, neither his intelligence nor his compassion 
   dimmed over the intervening years. </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">In the years after my graduation, I was 
   fortunate to join Reggie as an alum of the Department of Social Sciences.&nbsp; 
   Through this connection, I kept track of his work at the Agency for 
   International Development and other important policy positions.&nbsp; Our paths 
   would cross at various SOSH reunions.&nbsp; It was always good to share time with 
   Reggie and Emmy.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Over the last few years, I had the 
   privilege and pleasure to work with Reggie in his role as Assistant Secretary 
   of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.&nbsp; Reggie, as always, was the 
   consummate professional.&nbsp; He applied his considerable energy and skill to 
   meeting the needs of the Army in one of its most challenging periods as your 
   Army engaged, and continues to be engaged, in sustained combat operations in
   </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
   Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; But, Reggie’s service was particularly special because 
   he knew that it was not just about budgets and line items and press 
   releases.&nbsp; It was about those magnificent young Americans that he had the 
   privilege to lead as a Soldier and now was serving as Assistant Secretary.&nbsp; 
   His vision and his dedication made a profound impact on the lives of our 
   Soldiers.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Reggie also represented the Department of 
   the Army in the deliberations of the West Point Board of Visitors.&nbsp; In this 
   capacity, he made a great contribution to </span>
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">West Point</span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">.&nbsp; His quiet advocacy, buttressed 
   by his knowledge of and passion for </span>
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">West 
   Point, was a critical factor in making our voice heard within the Pentagon.&nbsp; 
   He can take credit for enabling much of what the Board of Visitors was able 
   to do for West Point.&nbsp; </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Reggie Brown was a man of many qualities, 
   but there is one he possessed that is not at all common.&nbsp; You were always 
   glad to see Reggie Brown.&nbsp; You knew you were in the presence of a true 
   gentleman whose good humor and good sense would be shared freely.&nbsp; He was a 
   man without pretensions; a man whose decency was obvious and compelling.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">And, if you were lucky enough, as I was, 
   to share some quiet time with Reggie and Emmy, you witnessed a loving family 
   whose thoughtfulness and kindness embraced you.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
   <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">In a few moments, we sill sing the Alma 
   Mater and, with special poignancy and meaning, bid our friend, Reggie, “well 
   done, be thou at peace.” He has finished that “long and arduous journey” that 
   began 44 years ago on the Plain; a journey that has taken him through the 
   jungles of war, the halls of academia and the corridors of power; a journey 
   enriched and ennobled by the mutual love of his wife and children and 
   grandchildren; a journey made lighter by the shared laughter of classmates 
   and friends; a journey of principle and purpose and fidelity to those he 
   loved and the Nation and the Army he so proudly served. </span></p>
