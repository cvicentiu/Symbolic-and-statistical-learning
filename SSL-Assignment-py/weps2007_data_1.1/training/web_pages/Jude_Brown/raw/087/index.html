<p>This Guide to Evaluating Leadership Development was commissioned by the NHS 
Leadership Centre in March 2005. The Guide aims to provide those involved in 
leadership development with a guide that is clear, practical and concise.</p>
<p>The Centre wanted to capitalise on the experience gained from evaluating 
leadership development programmes and to make this available to people in the 
wider NHS. The Guide was written by the Office for Public Management (OPM) in 
April - May 2005.</p>

<p>This report summarises the main learning points which have been identified 
from the wide range of leadership initiatives commissioned or undertaken by the 
NHS Leadership Centre over recent years. These learning initiatives have focused 
on developing strategic leadership, on building capacity and on developing front 
line leaders.</p>
<p>All available evaluation reports of leadership initiatives generated by the 
evaluation team within the LC and their framework providers - Development 
Resources Ltd; Henley Management College; Manchester School of Management; 
Northumbria University; and OPM - have been considered. Hence this report is 
based on nearly 30 evaluation reports completed by or on behalf of the LC over 
the past three years.</p>

<p>With the growing interest in and provision of coaching and mentoring 
attention has also turned to research and evaluation of these forms of 
development. </p>
<p>Consequently the NHS Leadership Centre evaluated some of its coaching and 
mentoring provision and carried out a piece of secondary research into the 
effectiveness of coaching. </p>
<p>We thought it important to summarise and disseminate the key findings and 
implications from this work to help inform future development activity. This 
report by the NHS Leadership Centre and the Office for Public Management 
identifies the main findings from a detailed review of coaching and mentoring 
research and evaluation reports undertaken or commissioned by the NHS Leadership 
Centre. </p>
<p>The report is clear about the positive response to coaching and mentoring 
from the majority of those participate but also raises questions about those who 
may choose not to get involved, and about the importance of a supportive 
organisational context.</p>

<p>At a time when many NHS organisations are seeking to implement either 
stand-alone or integrated coaching programmes there is little fully evaluated 
material to be found about their impact or effectiveness. </p>
<p>Also there is much confusion about what constitutes coaching:-</p>
<ul>
	<li>what is coaching?</li>
	<li>is it different from mentoring and counselling?</li>
	<li>If so, how?</li>
	<li>How and when should we use coaching? </li>
</ul>
<p>This document draws together some of the key themes and learning points from 
research into coaching and from the reality of putting research findings into 
practice. </p>
<p>The research was accessed through a thorough review into coaching 
effectiveness and the reality was drawn from the evaluation studies of a range 
of programmes commissioned by and delivered on behalf of the NHS Leadership 
Centre. </p>
<p>This report has been produced to complement the range of other reports into 
coaching and mentoring by the NHS Leadership Centre.</p>

<p>The amount of evaluation undertaken both nationally and internationally has 
increased considerably over past decades in response to the policy agenda of 
increased management accountability in the public services. Whereas audit and 
monitoring had a more narrow focus, evaluation takes a wider view, looks at 
different ranges of variables, uses many methodologies, and often tends to be 
more qualitative in nature. </p>

<p>This report presents the results of the evaluation of the &#39;Challenging 
Perceptions&#39; programme (November 2002 to November 2003). The overall objective 
of the programme was to provide leadership, career development and mentoring for 
female nurses in mental health to help them compete for leadership positions and 
redress the gender imbalance at senior levels of the NHS. The programme was also 
designed to challenge the mentors to become agents for change. </p>
<p>The findings from the Challenging Perceptions pilot programme can be used to 
provide a template for a Good Practice Leadership, Career Development and 
Mentoring Programme. This model could be designed specifically for other 
professional groups and adopted throughout the NHS.</p>

<p>This report presents the results of an independent evaluation of the 
pioneering joint venture between the NHS Leadership Centre, as part of the 
Modernisation Agency, and Manchester University&#39;s Business School. The 
objectives of the venture are to develop career, leadership skills and qualities 
of senior nurses in the NHS and to provide opportunities for greater links 
between senior managers and staff. </p>
<p>It is believed that coaching and mentoring are the keys to developing the 
leaders of tomorrow and such tools could meet the acknowledged training and 
development needs of nurses, while expanding the role of senior management and 
their links with those who deliver patient service. This pilot will potentially 
provide the framework for a leadership development model, which will be rolled 
out across the current culture to increase diversity in NHS leadership, while 
enabling participants to achieve their full potential.</p>

<p>This evaluation report provides a summary of the findings from all of the 
evaluation activity carried out with the first two cohorts of the Realise Your 
Potential Programme. This programme is part of the portfolio of development 
programmes for directors. Its target audience is executive directors who have 
the potential to become chief executives within four years. It aims to enable 
directors to develop capacity in their current role and to explore the chief 
executive role. Its objectives are to build understanding of the role of a chief 
executive and to help directors learn and equip themselves for the task of 
leading and changing a complex organisation. It also aims to challenge directors 
to question their current attitudes, beliefs and assumptions and to test their 
commitment to become a chief executive. </p>
<p>The findings provided evidence that the programme had been successful in 
developing the capacity of directors and equipping them to lead and change a 
complex organisation. It had enabled them to challenge their current attitudes, 
beliefs and assumptions and had tested their commitment to become a chief 
executive. </p>
<p>The evaluation included a variety of stakeholders and methodology in its 
design. It investigated the impact of the programme at individual, organisation 
and service levels. This report highlights how participants in a programme find 
it difficult to identify how they take learning back to work, and how learning 
has an impact on their organisation or services it provides.</p>

<p>This report presents the findings from case studies with participants on the 
first two cohorts of the Realise Your Potential programme. This programme aimed 
to enable directors to develop capacity in their current role and to explore the 
chief executive role. Case studies provide rich stories about how development 
processes take place. They enable narratives to be gathered from numerous 
stakeholders in order to explore the different factors that have an impact on 
development. They can provide information on the factors that inhibit and 
facilitate development. </p>
<p>The core research question for the evaluation was “what difference has 
attending the programme made for the individual, their organisation and the 
services they deliver?” </p>
<p>The findings have implications for the design and implementation of NHS 
senior management development programmes. Whilst senior managers have similar 
challenges, they face these under different pressures in different contexts. 
Programmes may provide greater benefits at organisational level if they are able 
to take this into account. The findings show that programmes provide a valuable 
vehicle for development by supplying relevant material in an environment that 
enables reflection and the sharing of experiences with others.</p>

<p>The Leadership at the Point of Care programme is part of the ongoing 
programme of modernisation and improvement in the NHS. It is a two year 
programme which started at the end of 2003. It aims to enable front line staff 
to see themselves as ‘leaders at the point of care’, to become change agents, 
and to be motivated and energised to improve patient care in a practical and 
relevant way. </p>
<p>This is the first evaluation report, commissioned by the Leadership Centre 
and carried out by Henley Management College. It reports the findings from a 
survey with programme participants. These findings have implications for the 
design and implementation of NHS development programmes for front line staff.
</p>
<p>The evaluation report provides evidence that this is a highly successful 
programme. The content is practical and relevant, offers learning which is 
useful in the workplace, and has real impact on improved patient care. The 
programme is successful at improving interpersonal skills, particularly in the 
areas of conflict resolution, negotiation, and team working. In addition, it has 
positive effects on morale, with people feeling better about going to work and 
feeling that the contribution they make at work ‘makes a difference’ and really 
does matter. The work based project work is a very important part of the 
programme and one of the highlights of its success. </p>
