&gt; &gt;I especially liked the way she handled the training of a 
&gt; &gt;woman warrior; she didn't gloss over the differences in
&gt; &gt;muscle strength between men and women.  I've read 
&gt; &gt;quite a few sword-and-sorceries that ignored those differences
&gt; &gt;and that error affected how much *I* enjoyed the story.  
&gt; 
&gt; Actually muscle strength has little to do with how good
&gt; a warrior you can make. 

I seem to remember that in _Paladin_ it was more size and reach
that was considered the problem, not strength -- that, and that
most male warriors in that society would consider a woman warrior
to be crazy and not deserving of honourable treatment.
