<b>Summary / Overview of Collection</b><P></font>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">
	The manuscript collection of Thomas Eveleigh Richardson (1847 1933), relates primarily to the history of Sumter County, South Carolina.  More generally, it pertains to the region east of the Wateree River.  Because old Sumter District covered territory beyond the present county limits and its people had social ties in Camden and elsewhere, researchers interested in Kershaw, Lee, and Clarendon counties will find pockets of information on those areas.<P>

	The manuscripts cover a period of nearly two centuries, from 1767 until Richardson's death in 1933.  Many of the papers dating prior to 1902 seem to be a remnant of the destruction that befell a larger hoard.  Richardson related that during his four year absence from Sumter between 1897 and 1900, the contents of his office were moved out, and many of his papers were "lost or destroyed and the balance in utter confusion."  A few years later, around 1902, a fire damaged part of his library.  Partially burned manuscripts in the collection bear witness that they did indeed survive a fire.<P>

	"Utter confusion" accurately describes the state of the collection from 1934, when the University of South Carolina acquired it for the Caroliniana collection, until 1998, when a federal grant made it accessible to researchers.  His collection has now been put in order and arranged in two series that reflect both his career as a businessman and civil servant and his activity as a collector of old manuscripts.<P>

Thomas E. Richardson personal and business papers (Series 1) contains materials relating to Richardson's various careers, his family, and his interests.  A native of Stateburg, South Carolina, Richardson as a young man served in the Confederate army, as clerk of the Sumter County provost court, and as trial justice.  Apparently, his stint in the latter post earned him the honorary title "Judge Richardson" long before he became a probate judge.<P>

	However, papers for the very earliest phase of his career are nearly nonexistent.  The main run of his personal papers begins about 1879, when he began acting as administrator of his mother's estate, and continues through the 1880s and 1890s, when he moved into the insurance and real estate brokerage business.<P>

	Around 1897, Richardson's business contacts with his cousin Hugh R. Garden of New York City led to his entry with Garden into management of a lowcountry sportsman's preserve called the "Santee Club"  As Richardson later explained, "My Insurance business played out entirely and I tried a Game Preserve on the Coast in which I expected to make a Ten Strike but that ended disastrously . . . to say nothing of the loss of my health owing to the unhealthy locality."  The turn of the century found him back in Sumter in the rare book and real estate business.<P>

	For several years, the book business seems to have become Richardson's main livelihood, and the 1905 Sumter city directory lists him as a rare book dealer.  But his desire to find a secure government post led to an unsuccessful bid to become secretary of the South Carolina Historical Commission.  Finally, in 1907, he became probate judge of Sumter County and held that position until his death in 1933.<P>

	The content of Richardson's papers mainly reflects whatever line of work he undertook at any given period.  Insurance and Santee Club business dominates the period from 1890 to 1900, while from 1901 to 1907, one finds extensive book lists and correspondence with librarians.  From 1907 to 1933, his work in the probate court generated legal papers relating to estate administrations, guardianships, and Confederate veterans' affairs.<P>

	To a lesser extent, the papers reflect Richardson's membership in church and civic organizations.  He belonged to the Episcopal Church of the Holy Comforter, the Knights of Pythias, and the United Confederate Veterans.  He seems to have inherited a number of the papers of the Wednesday Evening Club, a Sumter literary club to which he belonged in the 1880s.<P>

	Richardson was one of the "Bloom Hill" Richardsons; he traced his ancestry not to General Richard Richardson of Revolutionary War fame, but to the general's cousin, William Richardson of Bloom Hill plantation.  Thomas Richardson's papers reflect his well developed sense of roots:  He was connected to the Mayrants, the Eveleighs, and the Poinsetts, and he took a lively interest in his own and other people's ancestors.  His papers include correspondence with family members, including his uncle John Manly Richardson, a fellow genealogy buff who lived in Texas.  From time to time, he undertook genealogy research for out of state clients, and his papers include genealogical research notes.<P>

	Another key element in Richardson's thinking was his lifelong interest in South Carolina's published statutes, legislative reports and resolutions, and law and equity reports.  No doubt, he had acquired much of his knowledge from his uncle James Sanders Guignard Richardson, a leading member of the Sumter bar and State Reporter during Reconstruction.  Thomas Richardson had gotten his start in life as a clerk in his uncle's law office.  Later, he made the state's legal and legislative records his specialty as an antique book dealer.  He delved into the bibliography of the subject and he tried to corner the existing market by acquiring libraries belonging to the estates of prominent lawyers.  His letters and records as a book dealer and some of his other writings reflect this interest.<P>

	In July 1933, Richardson died as a result of injuries in a fall from the Sumter Courthouse steps.  The following year, an unpublicized gift from financier Bernard M. Baruch made it possible for the university to acquire his collection.<P>

The South Caroliniana Library's picture collection includes a photograph of Thomas E. Richardson.<P>

Richardson’s diverse historical collections will be found in the second series.  As a sideline to acquiring the libraries of prominent area residents for his book business, Thomas E. Richardson acquired their manuscripts as well.  His interest may have been partly historical, but in large part it was economic:  Old letters generally came with envelopes and stamps that could be sold to the philatelic market at a profit.  A 1902 legal document records how he bought the papers of Judge Thomas Boone Fraser, senior partner in the law firm of Fraser, Haynsworth, and Cooper.
<blockquote>
	Sumter, SC, June 11th 1902.  This is to certify that I have turned over to Thos E Richardson all the old Rubbish books, pamphlets, papers, Envelopes Stamps &c that were stored away in Judge Frasers Barn, He to dispose of such of them as prove Saleable to the best advantage possible and to turn over to me one half of the net proceeds thereof.  If anything is found among these things to belong to Mr W F B Haynsworth or others in whole or in part, He (T.E.R.) to account to said WFBH. or others for same, and to destroy balance at his discretion.  Signed in duplicate by D. M. Young as Administrator and Thos. E. Richardson in presence of H. D. Moise.  [on reverse]: Received of T. E. Richardson on a/c of sales of old Rubbish &c Sixteen & 74/100 Dollars. D. M. Young as Adm. per T. B. Fraser attorney Sumter, SC, December 22 [1902].
</blockquote>
	This illustrates in a nutshell some of the problems these papers pose for researchers.  Richardson disposed of the stamped envelopes and kept the letters, but failed to record missing names of addressees on the letters.  Not knowing the addressee often makes it difficult to know whose papers one is reading, for it is doubtful whether W. F. B. Haynsworth's papers were ever returned to him:  They still exist in the collection alongside the Fraser papers.  Moreover, at some point in the existence of the Richardson collection, papers of other Sumter law firms like Franklin and Montgomery Moses or [J. S. G.] Richardson and Son became intermixed with those of Fraser, Haynsworth, and Cooper.<P>

	Even if the lawyers' letters could be partially sorted according to addressee or provenance, the accompanying legal papers would be impossible to arrange due to insufficient information.  For example, they include solicitors' copies of court case documents where the Fraser firm and the Richardson firm argued different sides of the same case.  Thus no attempt has been made to reconstruct the various office archives that made up Richardson's historical collections.<P>

	Instead, they have been arranged as a group according to date or topic.  Skeleton keys have been supplied in the form of calendars for the general correspondence and legal papers, which consist predominantly of records from these various Sumter law offices.<P>

	A great grandson of General Thomas Sumter gave Richardson some Sumter family land records dating as far back as the eighteenth century.  Most of these are filed in either legal papers or general correspondence. A few have been separated from the Richardson collection and can be found in the South Caroliniana guide as part of the Thomas Sumter Papers.<P>

	Richardson's historical collections also include a variety of interesting mini collections that he may have acquired along with the lawyers' papers.  These illuminate various aspects of society in old Sumter District:  They include the correspondence files of the Sumter newspaper the <u>Black River Watchman</u>, the building committee records for the Sumterville Baptist Church, various militia records for the district, and records of the district commissioners of the poor, of public buildings, and of free schools.<P>

	When Richardson bought the railroad library of Camden civil engineer John McRae, he acquired McRae's manuscripts and sold most of them to the University of Wisconsin.  But a number of diaries and copybook letters relating to late nineteenth century Kershaw County eventually came to the South Caroliniana Library as part of the Richardson collection.<P>

	Richardson's personal papers give little or no explanation for his interest in some of these collections.  For some reason, he had the Sumter Telephone Company's records from 1895 to 1903  an interesting chronicle of the pioneering days of telephone service in the county.  A set of British legal records and a set of records for the Philadelphia merchant firm of Dutilh and Wachsmuth may have been philatelic acquisitions  he may have been interested in seals or stamps rather than in the content of the documents.<P>

<b><u>Series 1: Thomas E. Richardson Personal and Business Papers</u></b>
<a name="1.i"></a>
<P>
<b>Correspondence, 1857-1933 and N.D.</b> [Box 1, Folders 1-101 (letter); Box 2, Folders 102-111 (legal)] <P>

	Consists of personal correspondence of Thomas Eveleigh Richardson (hereafter cited as TER) with family and friends and his business correspondence as insurance agent, real estate broker, rare book dealer, and probate judge.<P>

	Family correspondence includes mainly letters from TER's brother Alister M. Richardson, his sister Mary Ellen, and his cousin Katie Mayrant Simons, including Alister's discussion of a 1907 gold mining venture in McCormick County and Katie's letter of 8 November 1886 mentioning damage and aftershocks from the Charleston earthquake.  TER's correspondence with his uncle John Manly Richardson (1831-1898) of Daingerfield, Texas, centers on their common interest in history and family genealogy; JMR's letter of 4 October 1892 describes in detail a Spanish cutlass thought to have belonged to their seafaring ancestor Edward Richardson.  TER had family connections to the descendants of Chief Justice Franklin J. Moses and received the 23 October 1889 wedding announcement of Lt. F. J. Moses, USMC.<P>

	TER's correspondence as insurance agent include letters on a variety of insurance company letterheads of the 1890s, including a highly graphic accident insurance letterhead for the Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York.  TER's real estate ventures included attempts in 1894 to sell Mayrant and Horry inherited lands, including Belle Isle plantation near Georgetown.  His papers as a shareholder in the Santee Club, 1897-1902, are filed as a separate group.<P>

	TER's activities as historian included his efforts to obtain an indexing job with the Public Record Commission of South Carolina in January 1895 and the position of secretary of the Historical Commission of South Carolina in 1905.  On 16 June 1894, the South Carolina Historical Society asked TER to write a history of Sumter County as part of a society sponsored series of county histories.  Although the volume was never written, TER evidently solicited material, according to a form letter draft, 18 March 1892.  A letter from G. H. Reid, 17 August 1895, supplied a sketch of Bishopville for use in the history.<P>

	From about 1901 to 1905, TER's activities as rare book dealer and his correspondence with librarians, book dealers, and philatelists are the main subject matter, and the letters document his acquisition of several major libraries, including the Oscar M. Lieber scientific library, the John McRae railroad library, and the Charles Pinckney library.  The McRae library was sold to the University of Wisconsin; many of the books from the Lieber and Pinckney libraries became part of the University of South Carolina libraries.  Many of the letters during this period are from Dr. J. W. Babcock, superintendent of the State Hospital for the Insane, who was one of Richardson's book customers.<P>

	In 1907, TER became probate judge of Sumter County, and until his death in 1933 his letters dealt largely with estate administrations, guardianships, Confederate pensions, and policy matters in connection with State Hospital commitments.  His correspondence with State Hospital superintendent Dr. C. F. Williams are a source for the history of mental health in early twentieth century South Carolina and contain reference to the pellagra and influenza epidemics of the period.<P>

	TER's letters contain information relating to his membership in church, clubs, and fraternal organizations like the Knights of Pythias.<P>

	Occasional correspondents in the collection (averaging one to three letters apiece) include Langdon Cheves, Colyer Meriwether, Edward McCrady, A. S. Salley, Yates Snowden, Henry A. M. Smith, William A. Courtenay, J. Adger Smyth, Barnett A. Elzas, Gaillard Hunt, Harriott H. Ravenel, R. Means Davis, and Preston Davie.<P>

	Undated correspondence is sorted under five subject headings:  letters as antique book dealer, letters as probate judge, family letters, miscellaneous letters, and William E. Richardson letters.  The last file contains letters of TER's father, including undated letters to his father from his mother Sarah Mayrant Richardson.<P>

	The collection includes a nine volume set of letterpress copybooks of TER's outgoing correspondence:
<blockquote>
	[1] May 1897-February 1903 (includes one letter dated September 1904)<br>
	[2] March 1900 (small volume, includes want lists of books)<br>
	[3] March 1901-November 1904 (bulk, April-November 1904)<br>
	[4] July 1902-April 1904 (includes "The James Families of St. Marks Parish")<br>
	[5] November 1904-October 1906<br>
	[6] November 1906-July 1910<br>
	[7] April 1910-September 1915 (includes records of the Carolina Cotton Company, September-November 1891)<br>
	[8] September 1915-October 1923<br>
	[9] December 1923-June 1928, December 1932 April 1933<br>
</blockquote>
	In addition, Richardson copied some correspondence into the blank pages of a county auditor's letterpress copybook he found in the Sumter County Courthouse.  His letters begin on page 154 of the book and include material from 1911, 1920, and 1925-27.  (The Sumter County auditor's office correspondence is indexed in the front of the book and covers the period 1880-1889.

<P>
<b>Santee Club Papers, 1897-1902</b> [Box 2, Folders 176-182]<P>

	Consists of TER's papers as a shareholder and manager of the Santee Club, a lowcountry sportsman's preserve centered in the Georgetown area and numbering prominent political and social figures among its members.  Hugh R. Garden, TER's New York based cousin, was a prime mover in the formation of the club.  TER acted as local agent for the club in its land acquisitions and other operations, but became convinced that the club was being mismanaged by an out of state clique.  He suffered financial losses instead of the profits he anticipated, and relations with his cousin became hostile.<P>

	His papers mostly document his evolving controversy with the club management, his threats of legal action, and his attempts to sell his shares.  They also include copies of club rules, by laws and extracts from minutes, and a letter from TER, 25 September 1900, giving a good general description of the club and its objectives.  Correspondents include Hugh R. Garden, club secretary George Gordon Battle, and other current or prospective members.<P>

	Three bound volumes relate to Richardson's term as manager for the Santee Club.  Two diaries/memorandum books cover the dates 10 May 1897-8 Feb 1899 and Oct 1898-Jan 1899.  An account book of the yacht "Santee" with C. L. Ford, 1898-1899, lists supplies purchased for the yacht/houseboat the club maintained for the use of members.

<P>
<b>Poetry, Essays, Speeches, And Translations</b> [Box 4, Folders 246-253]<P>

	Consists mainly of original compositions by TER and others.  Includes drafts of patriotic and political verse and essays evidently intended by TER for newspaper publication.  Includes draft writings by TER on the history of South Carolina legislative records, presumably for a "historical paper" that TER tried to submit in 1905 when applying to the Historical Commission of South Carolina for the secretary's job (TER thought the examination procedure was rigged in favor of A. S. Salley).<P>

	Contains papers, ca. 1887-1888, of the Wednesday Club, a local literary society that numbered TER, McDonald Furman, and John Kershaw among its members.  Includes a copy of the club rules and papers presented by various members on topics like "Bacon," "Richard Lovelace," Ossian," "Prometheus Unbound," "Oliver Goldsmith," "Edward Bulwer Lytton," "William Makepeace Thackeray," and "Fair Rosamond."<P>

	Also contains writings by authors other than TER, including school exercises and translations by unidentified hands, and speeches and essays by Judge Thomas B. Fraser which came into TER's custody as part of the Fraser papers.  Judge Fraser's support of the temperance cause as reflected in these papers contrasts with TER's own stand against prohibition.

<P>
<b>General Correspondence, 1805-1879 and N.D.</b> [Box 5, Folders 272-331]<P>

	These consist mainly of the business and personal letters of several prominent Sumter County lawyers, including Franklin J. Moses, Thomas B. Fraser, William F. B. Haynsworth, and James S. G. Richardson.  The subject matter reflects lawyers' concerns  property and money, legal arguments, and contemporary politics.  Also, there are letters from legal clients, cotton factors, merchants (including antebellum Sumter retailer Anthony White, Sr.), and collection agencies.  There is extensive correspondence relating to publication of the South Carolina Law and Chancery Reports in the years 1866 1876, when J. S. G. Richardson was State Reporter.<P>

	The letters contain a number of items relating to railroad affairs, notably an 1860 letter from Senator James Henry Hammond discussing his opposition to the Blue Ridge Railroad and other "mad railroad schemes," and an 1860 letter from D. B. McLaurin discussing ambitious plans to expand the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad.  A letter from B. Chandler describes an 1857 trip to Virginia by rail to see the sights and socialize with other South Carolinians at the mineral spring resorts in the mountains.<P>

	Letters written to the state attorney general in 1835 by James Wardlaw and Edwin J. Scott discuss the general sessions court records of Abbeville and Lexington districts and enclose historical summaries of criminal cases.  As clerks of court in their respective districts, Wardlaw and Scott submitted these reports at the request of Attorney General Robert Barnwell Smith (aka Robert Barnwell Rhett).  The Lexington general sessions report still exists and is now housed at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History.<P>

	A series of letters from 1852 to 1856 documents James Diggs Wilder's schooling at Cokesbury in Abbeville District.  After Wilder's mother died intestate, William Lewis, ordinary of Sumter District, took over management of her estate and sent fifteen year old James to the Cokesbury Conference School run by the Methodist Church.  After James attained legal age, he sued Lewis over the estate, and the papers  containing information about student life in the 1850s  became part of the lawyer's records.<P>

	The heaviest concentration of letters occurs between 1850 and 1872, and some notable states rights and secession documents exist for the decade preceding the Civil War.  An 1851 letter from John C. Calhoun's nephew John Alfred Calhoun endorses and lends moral support to a secession meeting at Sumter.  An 1856 letter from Sumter native John J. Miller gives a jaundiced South Carolina view of electioneering in Atlanta (then a Whig stronghold).  Letters from Charleston merchants talk about credit tightening during the 1860 secession crisis.  A letter from Sumter native N. N. Spann describes Alabama's reaction to news of South Carolina's secession.  Writing from Charleston on 29 December 1860, Albertus C. Spain, Sumter's delegate to the Secession Convention, describes the convention's stunned reaction when Union troops occupied Fort Sumter.<P>

	A sparse collection of wartime correspondence offers glimpses of economic troubles at home and casualty reports from Virginia battlefields.  The war years contain one letter from a noted figure  South Carolina's fire eating politician Lawrence M. Keitt.  Keitt wrote W. F. B. Haynsworth in 1861 from the Confederate capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, concerning efforts to get an army commission for Haynsworth's brother.<P>

	Reconstruction figures prominently in the extensive letters of J. S. G. Richardson, which mostly date from the period immediately following the war, and also in some of the Fraser Haynsworth correspondence.  The poverty of the state's people is evident in letters from the Southern Famine Relief Board of Philadelphia concerning distribution of food and money in Sumter County during the summer of 1867.  Also, Richardson's letters contain frequent applications for assistance from friends and relatives who had fallen on hard times.<P>

	In the courts, emancipation and the collapse of the Confederate government created unusual legal problems, as litigants argued over debts that had used slaves as collateral, or alleged that creditors had agreed to accept payment in Confederate paper.  The federal courts became swamped with bankruptcy cases.<P>

	Allegations of corruption and misrule abounded.  In 1866, Sumter County freedmen filed a list of discrimination charges against the the county provost court.  In 1867, Albertus C. Spain relayed an account of military governor General Daniel E. Sickles's boorish behavior on a railroad dining car between Baltimore and Wilmington.  In 1871, R. M. Thompson, who represented the Richardson law firm in Manning, found himself acting as legal counsel to a corrupt board of County Commissioners, and refused to transact business with them except in writing.<P>

	After 1879, TER's collections of manuscript letters cease and are superseded by his personal correspondence, which is described separately as part of his personal papers.<P>

<u>Abstracts and transcripts of selected letters</u><P>

6 March 1805.  Moses Glover, Charleston, to Peter Hautreux, Georgetown.  Draft of a letter advising that "the debts of the late Col H Horry your late wife & self do greatly exceed the amount of £1000 amounting in fact to the sum of £2100" and "that your Annuity must not only in future abate in the ratio or proportion of such excess but that I shall be intitled to a credit or refund for what I may have annually paid you above the amount of the annuity. . ."<P>

4 April 1831.  William Campbell Preston, Barnwell, to [John R. Spann, Sumter?].  "I shall hardly be able to reach Sumter the first week of court, as I must attend the election in this district.  I can form no conjecture of how it is to terminate.  The event is exceedingly doubtful tho my interest here is rapidly on the rise.  There has been a decided impression made in my favour here to day which I shall endeavour to follow up.  My opponent is industrious to the last degree and adopting all those arts which one might expect from his habits and character."<P>

6 October 1833.  W. W. Anderson, [Stateburg?], to John B. Miller, Sumterville.  "I hear you have very fine strawberries of the Hautboy kind.  Will you be so good as to give me some of the vines to plant, and let let me know where I may send for them.  Now is the time they should be planted to have them to bear next spring."<P>

7 July 1834.  [Franklin J. Moses,] Sumterville, to Hyam Cohen, [Charleston].  Draft copy of letter.  "Much to my surprise I have in a short time past discovered that Malvina is troubled with a bad cough & affected with the asthma & she informs me that she has been subject to both a long while.  I was not aware of this when I purchased her, or surely would not have bought a diseased negro."<P>

12 July 1834.  Hyam Cohen, Charleston, to Franklin J. Moses, Sumterville.  "As regards Malvinas cough & asthma I can only assure you when small she was subject to it; this I thought you were acquainted with, as she lived at your mothers House for years where you certainly had an oppertunity of knowing her better than I did."<P>

5 September 1835.  James Wardlaw, clerk of court's office, Abbeville, to Robert Barnwell Smith (aka Robert Barnwell Rhett), attorney general of South Carolina, Columbia.  Encloses list of general sessions cases for the district as per request.  "In some cases you will find more Bills of Indictment given out than tried, to be accounted for by the Defendants not having been arrested, Bills quashed &c.  In some cases Bills found for murder Prisoner found guilty of manslaughter, Murdering negro found guilty of killing in heat & passion, Riot found guilty of asst & Batty, Asst & Batty found guilty of asst &c.  In such cases I have put the conviction under the head of the crime which the verdict indicated.  The capital executions & Pardons are mostly given from memory having no record after sentence passed.  I have taken the trouble in making out the statement to divide it into periods of ten years, believing it might be useful.<P>

22 September 1835.  Edwin J. Scott, clerk of court of sessions, Lexington, to R. B. Smith (aka Rhett), attorney general, Columbia.  Encloses report of general sessions cases as per request of 7 August.  "The report goes back to 1806 when the first Court was held in Lexington. . . . There is no record of pardons in this office; one or two persons who had been convicted of capital offences were pardoned by the Governor before I came into office and I have so entered their cases in the Report because the fact was within my knowledge, but no evidence of it is filed or recorded here.  There has never been an Execution in the District in consequence of a conviction before the Court."<P>

20 June 1846.  William H. B. Richardson to Franklin J. and Montgomery Moses.  Regrets that "the Sheriff cannot aid Mr. Gatlin by waiting till October next.  I am not surprised however as he is opposed to my Election & would aid no one who he thought was friendly to me.  I mentioned to Col. M. Moses that whatever amount of money was in your hands, that I requested you would appropriate it to Gatlin's debt & in doing so to have me well secured.  I hope you are getting on well with your Election, we are doing all we can with those we are acquainted with in your County  this is between ourselves."<P>

9 December 1846.  Richard Watson Denton, Laurens, to Thomas B. Fraser, Columbia.  "I arrived home on Saturday evening last, not however without the regret of having left my Gold Watch & purse under the head of my bed at Caldwell's Hotel.  The watch had attached to it a guard having a medal presented to my brother William Denton and having his name inscribed on the one side and Greek letters on the other, also a Clariosophic Key with my name on it. . . . I have written to Caldwell & John Moore about them.  Will you inquire of Moore if he has recd them . . ."<P>

15 April 1847.  Thomas N. Gadsden, Charleston, to Franklin J. and Montgomery Moses, Sumterville.

10 June 1847.  Thomas Lesesne, Mobile, AL, to Ransom D. Spann, Hayneville, AL.  Has no recollection of any note made by Dr. Kennedy to W. Mayrant and has no acquaintance with the parties.  Believes that someone has him confused with Joseph W. Lesesne (Dr. Thomas Cooper's debt ridden son in law)."<P>

28 August 1847.  Ingraham and Webb, Charleston, to William E. Richardson, Sumterville.  "Yours of 24th Inst just came duly to hand and there is no use in our stating how willing we are to assist Mr. J. A. Colclough & have done so already to nearly $5000 for his sons & self. . . . now there is no question if the crop is a fair one it will fully repay us for these acceptances & make us easy, but the great fear we have, is the old Gentleman may get underway again as he did last season & begin to draw Dfts on us without limit & if we refuse to pay them he will send his Crop to Camden or some one else & we kept out of our money for some time."<P>

1 September 1847.  Ingraham and Webb, Charleston, to William E. Richardson, Sumterville.  Have been visited by one of Mr. Colclough's sons and turned down his request that they advance him $100 or $150.  "[H]is reply was you can do as you please Gentlemen but I give you fair notice not a Bale of the Crop shall be sent to your house for sale. . . . now we we do not know that he has any Controul over the crop in any way, but still we know full well once before they stopt the wagons up King Street a year or two ago & sold 14 Bales of the Cotton that was sent to us for sale . . ."<P>

7 December 1847 23 March 1858.  Four sheets of letterbook style entries containing letters to John A. Colclough from his sons G. Washington Colclough and J. Henry Colclough.  Washington's letters to his father concern his treatment in Charleston for a serious disease.  His doctors included James Moultrie, recommended as "unsurpassed by no other in this place in point of scientific, literary and professional attainments."

25 January 1848.  John A. Colclough to William E. Richardson, Sumterville.  "Receivd your letter relative to the Filly by coln W Hampton and have concluded to let him take her."<P>

1 December 1848.  Ingraham and Webb, Charleston, to William E. Richardson, Sumterville.  If you can sell the Hogs at 4 cts Gross or even 4 ct Nett with you, it will be better than sending to town, as we have seen Mr. Krieg the RR agent & he was very short.  Hogs or pigs pay 50/100 each & no deduction, this at once takes ½ to ¾ cts off the price offerd & our Butchers are none the most honest & as we would not be able to superintend personally the Killing & Weighing the[y] would take Care of their own interest."<P>

19 December 1848.  Hines Holt, Columbia, to Franklin J. and Montgomery Moses, Sumterville.  "Mrs. [Nancy] Roberts is now in my office and has been almost daily for the last month expecting to receive the ballance of the money due her, from her fathers Estate.

Do sell her land and forward the money at your earliest convenience as I am anxious to get clear of the old Lady."<P>

19 January 1849.  W. R. Fickling, Beaufort, to [Thomas B. Fraser?], Columbia.  "By the way if you have not in your library Chittys Precedents, take my advice and get it.  It is invaluable, not half as prolix as Chittys Pleadings.  With regard to the copartnership between Stuckey & Rodgers, you can certainly find plenty of proof in your neighborhood.  The letters are all signed Stuckey & Rodgers per Wm Rodgers and his signature if proven will fix the firm.  Tash & Ross & McLaines cases with a host of others in our reports will serve as authorities. . . . By all means have your Commissions issued at once as we wish the case tried at the Spring Term."<P>

8 March 1849.  John D. Coudy, Charleston, to William E. Richardson, Sumterville.  Has tried in vain to sell Colclough's negroes at both private sale and auction.  They are too old and quite unsaleable.<P>

22 April 1849.  W. R. Fickling, Beaufort, to [Thomas B. Fraser ? Columbia].  His client is anxious to know the outcome of <u>Dupont</u> v. <u>Stuckey & Rogers</u>.  "Our Court is just over and I have thank God a long vacation until November which I mean to spend in looking for a cooler climate than can be found here and therefore wish to close up all my business relations with my clients as far as practicable before trusting myself to the dangers of the ocean or the chance of a collision in a rail car, to say nothing of the many minor perils to which a man of my vagabond disposition is subject."<P>

5 February 1850.  W. W. Brunson, Charleston, to W. L. Brunson, Sumterville.  "Dear Pa:  This will inform you that I have once more landed in Charleston, and I hope if nothing happens, to land in Sumterville on day after tomorrow. . . . The city at present, they say, is very much crowded, it being race week, which is always the gala week or season in Charleston, rather cool however today."<P>

2 March 1850.  S. H. Boykin, Camden, to [Francis Sumter ?].  "Your Grandfather bargained and sold to James Tiller the land laying in the fork of Big and Little Lynchs Creek; paid a <u>Gray mare</u> towards the land at $80 or 85, he was to pay 75/100 per Acre, when I see Tiller and settle with him I will know the exact amount given for the mare. . . . You will receive a Statement for money recevd for Lands sold and disposed off for the Estate of Col. Thomas Sumter."<P>

10 March 1851.  Arthur and Moore, Columbia, to Thomas B. Fraser, Sumterville.  Requests execution of a writ in the case of <u>James V. Lyles</u> v <u>Lawrence Belser</u>.  "We wish Belser to assign his interest in a house & lot he owns in Columbia.  If he has rendered a Schedule which does not contain this House & Lot let us know & we will send Evidence of the fact.  We also wish you to Examine Belser himself as to his agency in procuring his own arrest.  [Sheriff N. B.] Hill is a great friend of B's & may have been induced to do what he did at Belser's suggestion.  This of course is confidential."<P>

26 June 1851.  Jacob Vanderpool, Jr., New York, to Franklin J. and Montgomery Moses, Sumterville.  "The Book you asked me to procure you I got this morng. & should have forwarded it but found that the post office will not forward bound books.  On the 1st July I shall be able to send by that conveyance as there will then be some alterations in their rules."<P>

19 September 1851.  John Alfred Calhoun (nephew of John C. Calhoun and signer of the Ordinance of Secession, 1860), Abbeville, to Messrs. Albertus C. Spain and others, Sumterville.  "In addition to its being now too late for me to meet with our Secession friends of Claremont, on the 23d Inst as invited to do . . . I regret to say, that the condition of health of my family would not allow me to leave home.  If I had time, I would like to indulge in the warm expression of my desire, that you may have union among you, in a bold and decisive course of action in resisting our common enemy.  I have only time, however, to say that I hope <u>Heaven</u> may bless the discussions now going on in our State so as to give us union at home  with union at home, South Carolina can accomplish our ends, by her separate action.  Without this union, I fear we can do nothing efficient, and must submit to a common doom with the South  destruction."<P>

21 August 1852.  F. W. Capers, Cokesbury Institute, to [William Lewis, Sumterville].  "You were misinformed concerning [James Diggs] Wilder's health.  He is perfectly hearty.  It has cost me some trouble to keep him straight enough to get along at all; but still he has done something & learned something.  After Dr. Gary's death, knowing from your letter to him that you wished Wilder's wants supplied, I have solicited clothing for him & purchased candles shoes socks & shirts &c on his account.  He is the most violent clothes destroyer I know, and has sometimes looked shabby.  I kept him so a month hoping that his next outfit would be better cared for.  I doubt if it helped him much."<P>

5 October 1852.  "Father" to Anthony White, Sr., Sumterville.  Inquires after Mr. De Lorme, Judith, and the rest of the sick in the family.  "I send by Hiram 25 cents  be so kind as to get the amt. in cheap tobacco for my black people."<P>

3 February 1853.  James D. Wilder, Cokesbury, to William Lewis.  "Mr. Lewis I heard that you had sent money to Col. Capers to pay for my acounts.

I like the place very well and the people too except a few very few . . ."<P>

4 March 1853.  Gabriel Hodges, Cokesbury, to William Lewis, Sumterville.  Encloses J. D. Wilder's account for the first session.  "I hope brother Lewis you will be satisfied as it regards my attention to Wilder. . . . I find a great change in his morals since he has been boarding with my family; in fact there is a change in the whole village since the students have been boarding in private families.  Our school is flourishing, I hope it will continue to do so."<P>

31 January 1854.  Maurice Strauss, postmaster, Cokesbury, to William Lewis, Sumterville.  "I am glad that you sent two to our male school and hope you will patronize also our female school which promise[s] to be very flourishing."<P>

11 November 1854.  John D. McLean ?, Darlington District, to Francis Sumter.  "I have understood that you ar the proper person to get information about the Sumter land in Chesterfield Dis ther has bin one plat sold & I have understood there was another bounding on the North Carolina line and if it be so I will give you a trade for it.  I have understood it calls for 96000 acres so I cant say any more unless I could see you if you think it worth my while I can come & see you I live in four mils of Tillers ferry on lynches creek . . . "<P>

15 November 1855.  William Pinkney Starke, Fulton P O, to Messrs. James Hall and Knevels, Charleston.  "My brother purchased some clothes of you at his last visit to Charlston.  I like the fit very much, and would be glad to get you to make me one or two suits. . . . My clothes must be made at once so as to be ready for me here by the meeting of the Legislature say two or three days before. . . . My brothers clothes fit me almost exactly.  Make the sleeves half an inch shorter, the tail of the coat ½ inch shorter and the shoulders ½ inch narrower.  Do not alter the pantaloons at all, nor the vests.  My brother (R. O. Starke) has "a cut away business coat" as he calls it which I like but would prefer a darker cloth, also a dress coat.  I wish two pairs of pantaloons of black cloth  one of black ridgy like my brother, the other a pair of dress cloth pants.  Of vests 2 pair, one black cloth double breasted, the 2nd a dark or darkish double brested) according to your taste but not too "flashy."  3 pair of white kid gloves, 3 pair of coloured do., 7¾ or 7½ small hands. . . . 2 or 3 fine black cravats & ½ white handkerchiefs."<P>

3 May 1856.  John J. Miller, Atlanta, to "Major" [Fraser ?].  "This is a Know nothing City & it does provoke me to hear men speak confidently of the Election of Mr. Fillmore as next President.  A paragraph of that mean, low, nasty, dirty, villanous, hyocritical, traiterous Ben Perry taken from the Patriot in praise of Fillmore is going the rounds of the news Papers here or rather of the Know Nothing Papers.  Upon these matters I speak pretty freely when an opportunity presents itself.  You know that we have a reading room here in the office & men assemble here to read the Papers & discuss Politics & an opportunity is afforded me of marking them.  There are some So Carolinians scattered about through the City who are of the right grit & Dr. Calhoun is one of them.  The native Georgians are generally speaking Whigs & hence a feeling of prejudice on their part towards us."<P>

5 June 1856.  Ingraham and Webb, [Charleston], to [<u>_______</u>].  "We see by the papers Wm. K. Bell has opened the Sumter Hotel at Sumterville and we send you our a/c against him Balance due $243.43 to 30 June 1856; now we want you to <u>make the money for us at once</u> , but you must be carefull.  He will not reply to any of our Letters, and we cannot get him to send us his note."<P>

20 July 1856.  Mary Ann Nettles, Benton County [AL], to "Mr. Vaun" [Vaughan].  "We are trying to get my Fathers Pention and we are Lacking A witness to prove that he Served in the Revolution War. . . .

All My Fathers old Accqaintance that I knew has Moved Away or is dead and we cannot find one old enough to Prove that he Served in the war."<P>

Frierson, & the Young Prince John in his wisdom declined to accept; the former threatened to Post at Stateburg on Yesterday; I presumed there would likely have been blood spilt, had not the Officers of the Law interposed & bound J. F. in a Bond of $5000.00."<P>

21 December 1856.  Samuel Z. Seale [?] to [<u>_____</u>] Greenwood.  "Mr. Anthony White who is a Brother in law of mine will hand you this;  he is a Merchant of Sumterville So. Carolina and has been doing a Successful business there, for about a quarter of a century; he expresses a desire to receive an agency for the selling of Cotton Osnaburgs and other heavy Goods; should either of your Factories wish an Agent abroad they could not entrust it to safer hands; he will give the best Charleston Refarances.  Mr. W being anxious to Return will probably make but a short stay in Columbus.  If you will inquire as to the matter and make the negotiations for him you will confer a favour on me."<P>

9 August 1857.  B. Chandler, White Sulphur Springs, VA, to [<u>_______</u>].  "Since I last saw you, on my way to this place I have seen much to interest and amuse me.  My health was feeble when I left and had to lie down in the car on my way.  I however traveled one day and night without stoping which brought me to Richmon for breakfast the morning after I left home.  I remained there to rest one day & to take a look at the city, I visited the capitol of the State, it is located on a high hill commanding a view of the city.  The arrangements are beautifull, at the entrance of the front door stands the full Busts of Jefferson & P Henry, in front a monument to Wasington (not yet completed).  We traveled the central R. Road, the view from the Road as far as we could see was Splendid, and more especialy when we reached the Blue Ridge, in assending the mountain the Scenery was magnificent, we had to pass though two tunels (the great one not yet finished) at a grade of 310 feet to the mile, of course we had to travel very Slow, on the road we had a passing notice of the Residence of Thomas Jefferson, University of Virginia, Lunatic Assylum &c."  Discusses accommodations and crowds at the various springs.  "Dr. & Mrs. Witherspoon could not get in here and have gone to the Salt Sulphur.  I hope to have the pleasure of meeting them in a few days.  I have seen many S. Carolinians in the mountains.  Messrs. Solomons & Delorme I left at the Sweet Springs, the[y] leave for the North tomorrow."  Reports confidential discussions relating to the prospects of "our Bank Stock."  To guarantee confidence, "Col. F. J. M[oses] & A. J. M[oses] must not be in the Board."  "P.S.  I left J. S. G. Richardson at the Hot Springs not much improved."<P>

21 December 1857.  [R. E. Fraser ?], Bank of Georgetown, to "Cousin."  "Truly, the presure in money matters has been and is still severely felt by all classes of our citizens and as there must be a cause which has brought about this state of things, the poor banks are mercilessly made the scape goat, the head and front of all the offending.  The inflation of every species of property prior to the crisis pointed unerringly to a commercial catastrophe, and if the banks foreseeing the breakers took the necessary precautions to avoid a 'smash up,' why blame them?"<P>

28 March 1858.  Robert Fraser, Bishopville, to Thomas B. Fraser.  "I will be down at Court if well enough to get there, for it seems that the Fates decreed to have a Jury Ticket served on me on yesterday, to serve as Grand Juror, so Thomas as this Grand Inquest must needs have some humbug presentment to make, can't you & Lawrence conjure up some popular humbug to gratify the morbid appetite of young America, such as the present Session of Congress is a nuisance, and the building of the State Capitol is costing the dear people a <u>little</u> more, than they bargained for, and that Banks in general and the State Bank in particular is the <u>One thing needful</u> in times of monetery stringency as the present testifies. . . . Do try to get up some sort a <u>thing</u> for a Presentment, for the Militia system,  the Poor house,  the Liquor business,  Negroe trading,  Public roads and bridges and the like have all had their day, & special notices.  Something new is now required.

It is some what probable that Gov. Brown may employ me for the State Road.  In that case I will live in either Atlanta or Chattanooga. . . . I am disposed to remain here all summer if I can find employment, as I desire to remove to Memphis about the first of September."<P>

12 July 1860.  James Henry Hammond, Redcliffe, to Martin Witherspoon Gary, Edgefield.  "I have . . . reviewed my reasons for declining to write any thing for the public prints in regard to the B. R. R. R.  So sensible am I of the heavy burden, without any reasonable compensation, the construction of the Blue R. R. Road by the State would inflict upon nearly all her people & so desirous was I to do whatever I properly could to avert it, I wrote a day or two after my return a letter to you such as might be printed. . . .  I have just now torn it up.  I must adhere to the course which I indicated to Mr. Seibels.  I am not aware that any of my predecessors have interfered with any line of State policy, by an appeal to our people, unless some Federal Policy was involved or some principle connected with our State Constitution was at Stake. . . . You may rest assured that your Representatives in the Federal Legislature have their hands full even when sustained by the State unanimously.  But to go there fresh from a heated controversy at home with nearly half your State against you would greatly weaken your position.  The <u>prestige</u> of SoCa in Federal Affairs is greatly owing to the idea, that as regards them, she is an unit & all her Representatives vote to gether. . . . Personally I arrogate nothing.  But there is a dignity attached to my present position that would be sacraficed were I to enter into a controversy about mere State <u>policy</u>.  You may not be so well aware as I am how far such a controversy would extend.  In 1847, when I had no public responsibility  no position the dignity of which was for the great interests of the State to be maintained, but abundant private leisure, I threw myself for amusement as I thought into just this very question. . . . Well I soon found that it taxed every moment of my time then.  That it wearied a much more facile pen than I can weild now, & that although for a time, I checked these mad rail road schemes, ultimately they wore me out & got the State to aid hundreds of miles of R. Roads that will not pay a dividend until they have been rotted down & been rebuilt half a dozen times if they ever do. . . . As a citizen of SoCa I am perfectly willing it should be known that I am entirely opposed to the expenditure of another dollar by the State on the Blue R. R. Road at this time.  As a voter in Edgefield District, I shall certainly oppose every Candidate in favor of doing it & do so openly.  But as your U. S. Senator I cannot take stump upon the question." <P>

17 July 1860.  Benjamin Gass, Greenville, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  Has a claim against Mary McRa for services rendered in Texas in the recovery of the Lundy Negroes. <P>

25 July 1860.  D. B. McLaurin, Stateburg, to "Lee."  "The more I investigate the plan adopted at Sumter on the 4th the more I am confirmd in the opinion I then entertaind, that the contemplated location cannot be made to pay.  I have taken the Statistics of the whole field that we can expect to occupy, to wit, Clarendon, Sumter, Kershaw & Lancaster, and added to it as large naval Store business as we have been able to get upon the N. E. Road (more than we can expect).  I have also allowed the usual proportion for up freight and a local mail and travel equal to the most favored roads similarly situated, and after taking out the necessary expenses for repairs and opperating the road, I am not able to come within one hundred thousand dollars of a paying point (7 pr ct).  Now I want yourself, Fraser & Blanding, all men of figures, to take hold of this matter and make a careful estimate. . . . Remember that we do not touch a bale of cotton upon the River side of these Districts. . . . we also <u>know</u> that No. Ca. will not give us a Charter to Raleigh. . . . this being the case it is folly to think of through freight or travel and we must make our estimates accordingly.  I have a big boasting letter from McCarny of Bishopville. . . . he proposes as a remedy for the refusal of N. C. to give us a Charter, that we connect with the Charlotte Road at the State line 12 miles below Charlotte, and seems to think it will all be right, just look at the absurdity of such a project, the Charlotte road must take the freight, bring it 12 miles and throw it all off on our route, thereby destroying 100 miles of their own line, will any man of common sense expect them to do this. . . . On the contrary if we unite with them at Ridgeway, only 22 miles from Camden, we make it their interest to Co operate with us, and I have the strongest assurance that they will do so, by this connexion we not only get their Charlotte freight but we take in the rich Districts of Fairfield Chester & York. . . . At Ridgeway we will be only 15 miles from Allston the junction of the Greenville & Union & Spartanburg Road and by these Roads we will be cordially met.  Now take the distance, at Allston, by our route it will be at least 15 perhaps 20 miles nearer than by the So. Ca. Road, at Ridgeway & Camden we will have an advantage of over 30 miles, this gives us two hours in time besides we give them a shorter road of easier grades and lower cost, these we all know to be controuling elements in freight, and passenger traffic, and with such odds in his favor, no Rail Road man would be afraid to compete against the world." <P>

12 August 1860.  Robert Fraser to Thomas [B. Fraser].  "So far as Kenedy's election is concerned, you must attend to your own interest and Pilot your own ship, don’t be lulled into inactivity be assured that the belief of your heading the Ticket may by chance leave you at home, I am not pleased at the movement of Bishopville there may be treachery in camp and it is wise to be wide awake." <P>

26 September 1860.  W. F. B. Haynsworth to [J. R. Haynsworth].  "That insurrection alarm Saturday turned out to be a false one--I am glad of it:  but I wouldnt be surprised if we have some true ones before very long." <P>

14 October 1860.  William H. Holleyman, Bishopville, to [<u>_______</u>].  "The object of this note is to procure your influence to get me the apointment to take the electoral vote of the State to Washington.  This apointment is made by the Electors. . . . The reason I know how the thing works is that I procured the apointment eight years ago through the influence of Dr. Ingram & yielded it to young Black who was going to Washington for the Corpse of his Father who died in Congress about that time." <P>

23 November 1860.  James Henry Hammond, Redcliffe, to Martin Witherspoon Gary, Columbia.  "When Dr. Cook went up to the public meeting I gave him our petitions here for the Downer & Hamburg Road & he left them at the village for you. . . . I send you also an article which I drew up some time ago in regard to this matter.  It is intended to meet the opposition from the owner of the ferry. . . . The ferry will doubtless be damaged by the road but that is no part of our purpose.  It will do us no good & none of us are hostile to the owners of it.  All we want is a convenient road for ourselves & one that we can get along on & also a chance at the Hamburg market.  If we Secede we can trade no where else." <P>

23 November 1860.  Harral Nichols and Company, Charleston, to J. T. Brunson, Sumter.

As soon as we are permitted to draw upon the Treas'y your correspondent will [be] paid his first dft." <P>

[29 December 1860].  Albertus C. Spain, St. Andrews Hall, [Charleston], to Thomas B. Fraser.  "I have no hesitation in saying to you that we are on the eve of great events.  If today the Executive <u>was ready</u> to take Fort Sumter by force & to prevent the entry of troops, the order would be given.  The order is <u>merely</u> delayed for the preparation, & [how] soon Batteries on Sullivan's Island, in Moultrie, on Morris Island & on the site of old Fort Johnson can be erected I have not heard.  Such movements are on foot.  The moment they can be opened with effect, the match will be applied, unless the President does, what no one supposes he will do, to wit, order all United States troops from the territory of So. Ca.  At present our Comssrs are without hope, the government is engaged in gaining time, & so are we." <P>

Car., that Patriotic & glorious little State; who would not be proud to be called a So Carolinian; could you hear the praise bestowed on So Carolina by the mass of the people here, you would be proud.  All think that if South Carolina had not taken the stand she did, & seceded, no other State would have seceded alone, therefore, nothing would be done, but as South Carolina acted independent & alone, it was like a spark of fire falling in a keg of powder, it set every thing a blaze, it united the whole of the gulph States, & will soon the boarder States. . . . I mounted my old Palmetto Cockade, & Button, that I wore in South Carolina during Nullification times as soon as I heard that South Carolina had called a convention, so sure I was that she would secede; so did my son James.  I had kept them as a memento, & glad was I, that I did so; when the people saw it on my hat, they did know what to think of it, but it was soon understood & admired; they are all wearing cockades now . . . . I was in Mobile the first week of the month. . . . the Arsnal & Forts were taken while I was down; the morning before it was taken I was taken to the Arsnal, & was shown evry thing in and about it; I was then informed confidentially by the Gentleman that took me thru, that that night, the fort would be taken. . . ." <P>

Cummings has up to the last meeting of the Medical Board always been exempt for physical disability; and although it may, strictly speaking, not be our business to go behind the decision of a medical board, yet the recent examinations have been carried on under such very strict orders, that we feel it would not be doing a man justice, to refuse to consider his health, simply because a medical board had passed upon him.

3 January 1868.  W. E. Smith, Sandy Grove, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "If I understand you they are going to defend the case on the ground that I agreed to take confedrate bonds for the note I can only say that I did not agree to any such a proposition . . ." <P>

6 January 1868.  Pressley, Lord and Inglesby, Charleston, to J. S. G. Richardson.  Discusses an arrangement to handle a bankruptcy case or cases. <P>

9 March 1868.  W. R. Giles, President, Wilmington & Manchester Rail Road Company, Wilmington, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "I was under the impression that you were of the firm of Richardson & Blanding and will write them in relation to the claims to which you allude as I requested them to attend to our business then generally." <P>

23 March 1868.  Albertus C. Spain, Darlington, to [J. S. G.] Richardson.  "Dawkins declines to try any of the cases involving the negro consideration question, what Moses may do I can't say.  The only point is emancipation. . . . I doubt, <u>per se</u>, the constitutionality of the new constitution & ordinances, but <u>de facto</u> they are law.  Ratification by the people & acceptance by Congress will make them <u>effectually</u> constitutional.  But the jury might play Edgefield & then not much harm could be done." <P>

10 April 1868.  Moses and Flowers, Sumter, to Moore, Jenkins and Company, New York.  "Finding that our Expenses are daily in excess of our income from profits, and as we are now considerably behind, we deem it most honorable to close up our business, and divide our assetts amongst our Creditors; . . . . Our failure is caused by the awful condition of our country, and if we shall be able to survive the present calamitous state of affairs we may be able to recommence business under fairer and better auspices." <P>

20 April 1868.  William C. Johnston, Georgetown, to [<u>_______</u>].  "My freedmen have been working so very irregularly & badly under my present system of <u>giving</u> provisions & paying $50 cash at end of year that I am compelled to adopt the due bill plan & pay up every Saturday whereby they can feel their losses." <P>

26 May 1868.  Joseph A. Speel, Philadelphia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "You ask me wether I am Conservativ or Radical, from 1860 to preasent time every think has been so mixed up with corruption & villiny, that a man scarcely knows where he stands, or what he thinks politicaly, So far as I Know my self, I was an old time wig, untill that party was broken up and then took part with the Republicans, and have voted with them untill sixty six, since that time I have not taken any part in Politics.  I am Conservativ and think after the Goverment here put down the Rebellion that should of been the end of it.  I cannot see any thing to be gained by the course the radicals are pursuing, unless the utter ruin of every thing. . ." <P>

28 August 1868.  John A. Inglis, Baltimore, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "You will learn from this letter, that I have taken my farewell of our distracted State, and sought a home for my Second childhood where the first was spent." <P>

1 September 1868.  R. M. Thompson, Manning, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "It is not usual that I should write in a business letter of anything but business, but in this instance I will give you the good news here.  There is a great change among the colored voters here, from the most bitter radical haragues some 3 weeks ago their Speakers are advising moderation and are very conservative in their views.  Some of them advise the negroes to stay at home and not vote at all.  The majority in favor of the Rads in the election for state officers was only I am reliably informed 370 to over 1100 in the previous voting on the ratification of the mongrel constitution." <P>

The Lawyers seem indisposed to buy any reports or Law Books of any kind now. . . . P. S. I did not deem it advisable to hand over the State Copies to the present Legislature at least at the late session as I did not think from what I heard that they would pay the bill until the regular session.  The kind of pay was also uncertain." <P>

23 November 1868.  Bachman and Waties, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "Will you be over in attendance on the "New Ct?"  Altho' out of Office the former Clk of Appeal Ct will be glad to see you below in his private den." <P>

7 December 1868.  Samuel M. Green to J. S. G. Richardson.  "I fear very much in the prejudiced state of the publick mind against negroe debts the decision of a Jury, I am apprehensive their finding will be against such claims for debt until a few chancery suits are otherwise decided." <P>

26 December 1868.  Iredell Jones, Rock Hill, to "My Dear Cousin."  "A friend of mine wishes to get a canary bird and I observe by advertizement in the Charleston Courier that there is a supply just arrived and for sale by Mr. P. Meitzler Globe Hotel No 60 Queen St.  Please purchase a male canary bird a "Singer" without cage. . . ." <P>

11 January 1869.  R. M. Thompson, Manning, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  Thompson's medical condition may require a re amputation of his arm. <P>

26 January 1869.  James McCarter, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "I called this morning on Mr. Whipper the Judiciary Chairman and found that he had done nothing towards the Resolution for taking the additional copies of the three published volumes:  I am very much afraid that in the absense of Judge Moses, the matter will be neglected.  I shall continue to call Whippers attention to it but there is a deal of difference between my promptings and a hint from the Chief Justice." <P>

8 March 1869.  J. Adger Smyth, Charleston, to D. J. Bradshaw.  "We cannot sell any thing for Twelve Dollars that is at all a good article, nor one such as I know you want.  We have nothing but german guns at that figure.  For $18.00 to $20.00 we can sell you a very fair English gun . . ." <P>

12 April 1869.  John P. Richardson, Southern Express Company, Manchester, to J. S. G. Richardson.  JPR and his brother came as far as this depot hoping to see JSGR, but cannot get a train connection to Sumter.  Their object is to get possession of the estate of Col. James B. Richardson, which is threatened by a number of lawsuits, and they want to discuss strategy with JSGR. <P>

30 April 1869.  J. E. Lippitt, Wilmington, to Guignard Richardson, Sumter.  "I will send you 4 Barrels Ice on Saturday, Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.  Should you require more you can Telegraph me & I will send without fail.  I would be pleased to have your & your friends orders for Ice this season." <P>

15 October 1869.  Benjamin F. Smoot, Huntingdon, West Tennessee, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "Some years ago 1853 my uncle Josiah Smoot residing in your district died leaving a considerable estate.  It was supposed he had no heirs.  His property was thereupon taken by the State & devolved upon an Educational Society in your place.  Subsequent to this in 1859 or 60 it was ascertained that he had relatives residing in North Carolina and my father in this State. . . . His land had been disposed of by the law in such cases provided & consequently [the lawyers] had (after gaining the case in the courts) to apply to the Legislature for compensation & obtained in December 1861 an appropriation of $2,000.00, there being 5 heirs the share of each was about $400.00.  They then had power of Attorney to draw the money for all the heirs except my father with whom in consequence of the war they could have no communication.  (His heirs I should have said for my father died in 1859.)  The Share to which my fathers Estate is entitled was never drawn but is still credited on the books of the State Treasury."  Has had no information since 22 May 1868 and wants JSGR to look into the matter. <P>

17 March 1870.  F. G. de Fontaine, Charleston, to G. Richardson, Sumter.  Advises Richardson on a course of study to train as a legislative stenographer." <P>

13 June 1870.  Egeria Richardson, Mill Cottage, to "Uncle."  Reports her family's financial problems and asks help in seeking employment as a governess for small children or assistant housekeeper and seamstress. <P>

28 June 1870.  J. Dyson, Philadelphia, to James S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "In answer to your inquiries I have first to state, that the year in which the widow of the late John Singleton died, and the year in which Richard Singleton, Trustee, purchased the Big Lake plantation, were, agreeable to my recollection, in the years 1834 and 1835, as stated in your letter; but the month or time of the year, I am unable to state.  My impression is, that the slaves belonging to the Trust Estate on Midway plantation were moved to Big Lake plantation in 1835 but am unable to state the time of the year.  As respects the crop made on Big Lake plantation in 1835, the safest and only sure guide to which I can refer you is the Book of a/cs of the Trust Estate on the three plantations of Deerpond, Cuddo and Big Lake.  The a/cs for the latter plantation for 1835 & 1836 will answer the question.  The a/cs of these estates were kept strictly separate and distinct, and were so required to be kept, by the Will of Mr. John Singleton.  I have no recollection of a crop of any kind raised on Midway plantation in 1835 being carried to the credit or a/cs of the Trust Estate, but if such has been the case, I certainly believe it will appear in some one of the Trust Estate a/cs, with a statement of the source from whence derived." <P>

3 September 1870.  [<u>_______</u>], Sumter, to Gen. J. B. Kershaw.  Discusses a compromise decree in the Singleton case.  "The Defendant has the right to except to these decisions, & may be heard, first before our Circuit Judge, and then, upon Appeal before the Supreme Court.  The only Judge of the Supreme Court, who has any familiarity with our laws, Chief Justice Moses, cannot hear the case, having been of counsel.  We think it very imprudent & unwise to risk almost the entirety of so large a decree upon the decision of the other members of the Supreme Bench. . . . Of the vast property left by Mr. Richard Singleton there remain, in the hands of the original devisees, only two plantations, True Blue, devised to the children of Mrs. DeVeaux . . . and Head Quarters, belonging to the two sons of Matthew R. Singleton.  The property devised in trust for Mrs. Van Buren has been sold, also that devised to John C. Singleton: and we have just today learned from Mr. Blanding, that the Home Place, devised to Richard Singleton, has been sold under judgments against him, & was purchased by Robert Brown." <P>

26 September 1870.  James D. Kirkpatrick, Charleston, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "The Book Keeper who made the entries for the a/c of Brown Manning was killed during the War.  I can very readily prove his handwriting, and send up the Books." <P>

2 December 1870.  Wilmot G. DeSaussure, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  Encloses copy of the order in <u>Van Buren</u> v. <u>Brown</u>.  Judge Bryan has directed that all important land sales be advertised in the <u>Daily Republican</u> in Charleston. <P>

27 March 1871.  R. M. Thompson, Manning, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "Yours March 25th received by todays mail, in relation to our being retained as Councill for the County Commissioners. . . . I became conizant of some transactions of thier chairman that I could not approve of, notified them that we could not act any more for them, and considerd our bargain at an end, since my notice to them they have not called upon me, I have studiously avoided having any connections whatever with thier official duties, and only advised them when called upon, and then upon only the matter submitted and that written.  You were correctly informed as to thier social status., they are in my opinion a set of the vilest and most corrupt scoundels I ever heard of. . . . I feel satisfied however that henceforth I will be little troubled with them, as thier chairman claims to be possessed of more legal knowledge than the entire Bar of South Carolina, hence they following his leadership have very little use of an adviser." <P>

27 April 1871.  J. Woodruff, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "I learn from His Honor Chief Justice F. J. Moses that you are preparing for publication the descisions of the Supreme Court. . . . As agent and business Manager for the Republican Printing Company, I beg leave to ask that the Manuscript when ready be forwarded to my address at Columbia, the resolution providing that the work be done by the Republican Printing Company." <P>

30 September 1871.  R. J. Moses, Jr., Columbus, GA, to E. W. Moise, Sumter.  "Dear Cousin Edwin:  I have directed Hammond to send you at once Volumes 39 & 40 Georgia Reports.  In Volume 39 Pages 405 to 420 Battle v. Shivers you will find an elaborate opinion not only Showing the Knapp judgment to be both Dormant & dead, but also shewing . . . that the non residence of the plaintiff does not affect it. . . . Make a square fight on Dormancy question with Richardson, if you get beaten file bill to enjoin on ground of judgment being opened here & if you have to compromise at last we can save you a good deal by making the arrangement with Downing for you.  Lawyers Judges & the people generally, in this state, are demoralized on ante war debts." <P>

21 October 1871.  E. W. Seibels & Co., Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "I observe your notice of sale of the Singleton Lands, below Columbia, this is in our line & we would be glad to serve you in the matter." <P>

11 January 1872.  Montgomery Moses, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  ". . . <u>all of my papers</u>, being in the Greatest Confusion, (which were huddled <u>all together</u>; & without any assortment, at a very short notice) by reason of Mr. Moise tearing down the Office I formerly occupied, & necessitating their removal, & at a time when I was absent. . ." <P>

12 January 1872.  H. D. Garden, Albany, GA, to J. S. G. Richardson (Uncle James).  "Since writing you last May, I have been engaged as a Civil Engineer for a R R Co operating in South West Ga, and doing very well I thought at a Salary of $150 per month; but in November the Company (which was a part of the Radical swindling ring in this State) failed without having paid me any thing. . . . I hope however that some of the many projected roads in this State will begin soon and offer us (the victimised Engineers in this Section) the opportunity to recover . . ." <P>

25 March 1872.  R. L. Bryan, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  "A new edition of Williams on Real Property is in press . . . We will send you a copy as soon as published."  Inquires about copyright status of the State Reports; no copyright entry appears on the reverse leaf of the titles." <P>

8 June 1872.  S. Sumter, Stateburg, to [J. S. G. Richardson ?].  "I suppose like the rest of us you are a Greely man, there is a gleam of hope for us, but that almost fades when you think of the Negro Majority, which only time can remove.  The Northern papers are certainly mistaken in their Certainty of his getting the Negro Vote, An honest Govt is the last thing they wish for. . . . If Grant has the nerve now is the time to Rule or smash the so called Union by the Effort to become Imperator; which will he do? the difference to us (So Ca) will be small." <P>

24 July 1872.  C. M. McJunkin, Republican Printing Company, Columbia, to J. S. G. Richardson.  Received another batch of copy yesterday.  Will there be enough matter to make a third volume?  [Written on company letterhead]. <P>

8 November 1872.  William F. Ervin, Walhalla, to J. S. G. Richardson, Sumter.  "Let me congratulate Sumter by having once more a Governor from her Ranks." <P>

4 January 1873.  J. J. Richardson, Camden, to "James."  "I will try to get the appointment of Trial Justice, with small hopes of geting it though.  I must ask you to help me with the Governor if you think it worthwhile. . . . [P.S.] I must beg that you write to Gov. Moses as soon as you get this." <P>

8 December 1873.  John B. Gordon [United States Senator from Georgia], Washington, DC, to "Fred."  "I am the son of Rev. Z. H. Gordon & the friend of your youth & swoped coats with you, while going to school to Hall.  Glad to hear from you.  Will look after your interest as mail contractor & at once see what can be done to affect the amendment you suggest to the Law." <P>

11 February 1878.  R. E. Fraser, Georgetown, to Thomas B. Fraser, Columbia.  "We are in a bad way in Georgetown, no sheriff, no clerk of the Court . . . , only one County Commissioner, no school Commissioner nor Coroner.  Negroes have been elected to these offices, who cannot give good bonds & the fear is such bonds as they can make will be held until about the expiration of the thirty days in which they have to qualify, & upon an ex parte showing obtain their commissions."  Is obliged for TBF's offer of assistance in obtaining the railroad charter, "as we have no representation in the Legislature save in name." <P>

N.D.  George W. Lee, Charleston, to [Thomas B. Fraser].  "Have you got my pardon yet from Judge Moses?  Please get it at once that when I come up this week, I may see the precious document. . . . The Yankees have bot a church for the Negroes within 60 feet of this house & just now they are going on wildly over there"<P>

N.D.  George W. Lee to [Thomas B. Fraser].  "S.C. Treas. Notes sell here at 10% Disct in the market & on the S.C. RR.  Will do my best with them for you.  Friend J S Richardson speech on 14 Inst. describes creditor class as "humane, gentle, easy to be entreated" &c & yet he refuses Greenbacks for the note you & H. Haynsworth kindly signed with me to Est. Mrs. McFadden, demanding the Specie.  Oh! tempora! Oh! mores!  Don’t you think he "ought to be ashamed," & the advertizd terms at sale were notes <u>Six Mos</u> after treaty of peace between Conf. & U. States." <P>

N.D.  H. E. Nichols to Thomas B. Fraser.  "The metal tube of elbow shape, is, to fit on the bottom of the waste water pipe, on the bottom of the Refrigerator which is kept full of water all the time and thereby excludes the air; put a pan, or any thing under it to catch the water as it drips over.  The jar in the top is for Ice water not Liquor, unless you want it for that.  The cock is to draw it off without raising the lid.  You should put in just as much Ice at first as the top will hold and some below to cool the box thoroughly through, after it is once cold then a small quantity of Ice will be sufficient; all the directions are in the lid of the Refrigr." <P>

<b>Legal Papers</b><P>

<u>General Legal and Business Papers, 1767 1887 and n.d.</u> (2,872 Items)<P>

	Consists of records relating to money, land, slaves, and routine court matters, including conveyances, plats, wills, inventories, accounts, bonds, federal and state tax records, powers of attorney, writs, subpoenas, affidavits, depositions, and letters of administration.<P>

	These include several noteworthy items relating to major figures in South Carolina history  a copy of Lieutenant Governor William Bull's 1777 conveyance disposing of extensive holdings in the state, a 1795 sheriff's title to Thomas Sumter of the store and tavern at Great Savannah, and contracts and specifications for two houses built in Sumter District for Franklin J. Moses, Sr. <P>

	Business accounts include papers of Thomas B. DesChamps and of Sumter merchant Anthony White, Sr.  The collection contains accounts of Moses Glover that were originally part of the Thomas Waties papers; as Glover's brother in law, Waties administered his estate. <P>

	A set of receipts for the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Railroad Company covers the years 1838 1843.  For the years following the Civil War, a set of account statements reports sales of upland cotton for the Cheraw firm of Moses and McNair by two Charleston firms  Kendall and Dockery and George W. Williams and Company. <P>

	Some items relate to litigation filed separately in the collection as court case folders.  For example, the accounts of Benjamin Mitchell, John M. Plowden, and R. A. Bethune relate to the lengthy suit of <u>Mitchell</u> v. <u>Plowden and Bethune</u>.  An 1867 conveyance by R. La Roche Heriot to David G. Robertson relates to several cases the Robertson family filed against Heriot and others. <P>

	For the period after 1872, the records are fewer and of varied types.  A dispute between the Singer Manufacturing Company of Charleston and the estate of a deceased salesman, C. W. Miller, caused the estate lawyer to preserve a set of 1870s business accounts relating to Singer sewing machines.  And the records include one draft copy of a Mexican War widow's pension application, submitted in 1887.  <P>

<u>Court Cases  Equity, Common Pleas, General Sessions, and Probate</u> (153 Case Folders and 102 Items)<P>

	Consists of case files from at least two different Sumter law offices  Thomas B. Fraser's firm (Fraser, Haynsworth, and Cooper) and James S. G. Richardson's firm (known at various times as Richardson and Green, Richardson and Moses, or Richardson and Son). <P>

	Because most of Sumter County's court records have survived intact in public custody, many of the documents in these files are no doubt lawyer's copies of the same papers that are filed in the courthouse records.  But in some instances these files contain extensive lawyer's notes on testimony or drafts of closing arguments that may not exist in the county records.  Moreover, the records provide a solicitor's eye view of legal practice in the county and depict practice in several different courts, including the South Carolina Supreme Court. <P>

	Most of this material is undated, but the content of many of the cases identifies them with the Reconstruction era.  Some cases can be dated more or less precisely from related letters in the general correspondence papers (as in <u>Knapp</u> v. <u>Moise</u>) or from related business forms in the general legal papers (as in <u>Roosevelt and Company</u> v. <u>Moses</u>).  The user should keep in mind that papers in other parts of the collection may relate to these case files. <P>

	Examples of the varied issues argued in these cases include <u>Ex Parte William Nettles</u>, a partition case involving so many heirs that the participants needed elaborate family genealogical charts to determine which descendants received fractions of the estate amounting to one sixty third or two eighty firsts.  In <u>Mitchell</u> v. <u>Plowden and Bethune</u>, the litigants introduced lengthy testimony concerning turpentine, whiskey, stills, and Union army raiders.  <u>Ex Parte Jacob Ottolengen</u> was an abrasive child custody fight between a Confederate blockade runner and his unfaithful wife. In <u>The State</u> v. <u>David Robertson</u>, the defendant was tried for perjury in connection with another case.  And in <u>The State</u> v. <u>William G. Kennedy</u>, Judge R. B. Carpenter attempted to convict the editor of the newspaper <u>The True Southron</u> for contempt of court.  In reference to a case under trial, Kennedy's paper had referred to the judge as a "Kentucky renegade," a "dog," a "thief," a "Hell hound," and a "compound scalawag and carpetbag adventurer." <P>

	Included with these files are several folders of material that cannot be sorted into specific case folders  notes on arguments and legal precedents, miscellaneous testimony and evidence, financial statements, dockets, and lists of judgments. <P>

	In addition, the Richardson collection originally contained summary reports on general sessions cases in four South Carolina districts  Chester, Laurens, Lexington, and Marion.  In 1835, the clerks of court in the various districts prepared these at the request of the state attorney general's office.  The Marion clerk's report, titled "List of Offences against the State, presented in Marion District, [1801 1835]" is filed here with the miscellaneous court case material.  The reports for Chester, Laurens, and Lexington are still extant and are currently part of the holdings at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History. <P>

<u>Bankruptcy Proceedings</u> (26 Items)<P>

	Consists of documents from bankruptcy cases in the District Court of the United States for the District of South Carolina, 1859 1874 (bulk, 1868 1870), including court orders, notices to creditors, blank forms, and in a few cases extensive schedules of personal property.  The petitioners who filed for bankruptcy were Charles R. F. Baker, J. B. F. Boone, Richard B. Cain, W. J. Dargan, R. Rutledge Dingle, Thomas D. Foxworth, John J. Hodge, William S. Hudson, Francis H. Kennedy, Wade Hampton McLeod, William J. Norris, and William C. Skinner. <P>

<u>Singleton Estate Records</u> (58 Items) <P>

	Consists of documents relating to an estate trust set up under the will of Captain John Singleton (1754 1820).  Singleton left vast holdings in land and slaves to his heirs, and his son Richard Singleton administered the estate.  Disputes among family members led to legal complications and years of litigation.  Richard Singleton's death in an 1852 collapse of a railway trestle left the estate records in disorder.  Various prominent lawyers, including Franklin J. Moses, Albertus C. Spain, and General Joseph Brevard Kershaw, became involved with the estate either as solicitors or trustees.  The manuscripts that ended up in the Richardson collection may have been gathered in connection with an 1870 suit by the northern heirs to break John Singleton's will. <P>

	The records include mainly financial accounts of the estate and lawyers' notes and documents relating to the various lawsuits over the inheritance.  Of particular interest are the records concerning the Singleton family slaves, which list family groups by name and discuss prohibitions against separating family members. <P>

	A number of letters filed separately in the collection as general correspondence relate to the Singleton estate.  These include letters from Henry Oelrichs and J. Dyson discussing the litigation.  Also, some letters make reference to a suit in Galveston, Texas, over a group of slaves referred to as the "Lundy Negroes," apparently a part of the Singleton inheritance. <P>

	The Singleton estate records are sorted under the following headings. <P>
<blockquote>
	(1) General accounts.<br>
	(2) Accounts of Powell McRa and Mary McRa.<br>
	(3) Lists of slaves and accounts of slave hire.<br>
	(4) <u>R. L. Livingstone</u> v. <u>Martha R. Singleton</u>.<br>
	(5) <u>Rebecca Rees and Ann S. Rees</u> v. <u>Richard Singleton</u>.<br>
	(6) <u>Richard Singleton v</u>. <u>John James</u>.<br>
	(7) <u>Richard Singleton</u> v. <u>John R. Spann</u>.<br>
	(8) <u>Albertus C. Spain</u> v. <u>Richard Singleton</u>.
</blockquote>
	Note:  See also letter from F. J. and M. Moses to William H. R. Workman, 21 January 1852 (accession 12249) in the South Caroliniana guide. <P>

<u>James L. Haynsworth Estate Records</u> (71 Items) <P>

	Consists of accounts due to the estate of Dr. James L. Haynsworth (b. 1825?), a dentist in Sumter, SC., for services rendered between 1853 and 1860.  These contain itemized statements of dental work performed for various households in Sumter District over a period of several years.  For example, the account of A. J. Moses includes "[16 Feb 1853] To Extracting Tooth son Horace $1.00; To 2 Gold fillings self $4.00 . . . [29 Feb 1854] To Extracting Tooth for Servant Rachel $1.00 . . . [7 Sep 1854] To 1 Gold filling & Removing Tartar [for] Lady $2.00 . . . [9 Feb 1856] To Separating Teeth & Destroying nerve $2.00 . . . [20 July 1858] To 3 Gold fillings for Daughter Rebecca $6.00; To 1 Box Dentifrice $.50." <P>

	The account statements are filed alphabetically by head of household. <P>

<u>State Tax Records, 1876 1879</u> (56 Items)<P>

	Consists of a set of Sumter County property tax receipts for the years 1876 1879 and a set of printed reports issued in January 1877 by George W. Reardon, court appointed referee in a case against John B. Johnston, county treasurer of Sumter County.  Reardon submitted his opinion that bills or notes issued by the Bank of the State of South Carolina and tendered in payment of 1876 taxes were valid and must be accepted by the state.  The file contains a separate report by Reardon for each taxpayer involved in the case. <P>

 	Presumably, both the receipts and the reports were papers of Fraser, Haynsworth, and Cooper, who were attorneys in the case.  W. F. B. Haynsworth, one of the partners in the firm, became Johnston's successor as county treasurer after Wade Hampton became governor<P>

<u>Jury Lists and Jury Matters</u> (14 Items) <P>

	Consists of lists of Sumter County petit jurors for 1850, 1872, 1873, 1875, and n.d. and one jury pool list with strikes.  Also contains an undated charge to the grand jury by J. S. Richardson and affidavits alleging irregularities in drawing the petit jurors during the 1873 spring term.

<b>Records of Sumter County Boards</b><P>

<u>Commissioners of the Poor</u> (4 Items)<P>

	Consists of draft reports by the committee to select a site for the poor house of Sumter District (including pencilled notes of commission minutes), a fragment of the commissioners' account current with the Lunatic Asylum in 1865, and a petition recommending Richard Amory and his wife as applicants for relief.  "It may not be improper to state that Richard Amory is the son of a Revolutionary character who served a good and faithful Souldier, in the War of 1776, after which period he removed from the State of Virginia, to South Carolina where he resided until his death." <P>

<u>Commissioners of Public Buildings, 1842-1867 and n.d.</u> (40 Items) <P>

	Consists of accounts of receipts and expenditures, board resolutions, correspondence, and proposals for construction and repair of public buildings.  Includes accounts for purchase of stationery and record books from the Charleston Account Book Manufactory operated by Walker, Evans and Company.  Includes accounts with the <u>Sumter Watchman</u> for publication of grand jury presentments.  Includes records relating to the construction of both the 1857 jail that was burned in 1865 and the 1867 jail that was built to replace it.  One undated document, ca. 1858-59, refers to intended use of the pre 1857 jail by the town of Sumter and has on reverse side a pencilled sketch that may be a ground plan of this earlier building, which was also burned in 1865. <P>

	A 23 August 1867 letter from Sargent, Illusionist, to M. Moses, chairman of the board of public buildings, seeks permission for his "giving public entertainment in <u>Magic</u> in the Court House, & I shall be pleased to give one half the receipt of my first performance for the benefit of the poor of Sumter." <P>

	Of particular interest are documents relating to invasion by federal troops in 1865.  An extract from the board minutes, dated 16 February 1865, resolves that "the commissioner in equity, ordinary, Clerk, and Sheriff of Sumter District be and are hereby instructed to have all the Books and records of their respective offices carefully boxed up and removed to some point at least Ten miles from the Court House and deposited in a covered House, each office to select a different place in order to save as many of the public Books and records as possible from the depredations of the enemy." <P>

	An 1867 account records payment to Noah Graham, the district ordinary, for "returning Books and Records of Office, amt paid for repars on wall of Office and white wash after vacated by garison officers of Federal Army, Amt paid for reparing Lock broken by forcing into office by Federals, amount paid for Iron bar cross window destroyed by Federal occupants." <P>

	In June 1867, a letter from the board to General D. E. Sickles, Commanding Second Military District, recounted that "When General Potter occupied the town of Sumter the Court House was being used as a Confederate hospital and escaped burning but the jail was burned to the ground.  Some time after the surrender of the Confederate armies The Commissioners caused the Records to be returned to their proper Offices and they were brought back in great confusion and disorder but with very slight loss of papers.  The Books of the Sheriff had been somewhat more exposed and several of them were so much injured that it was necessary to purchase several new books and have them made copies of the injured books.  For these and other new books, the expense of copying and rearranging the Records and many repairs to the Court House made necessary by the entire destruction of all its furniture, benches, chairs, and so forth, during the occupation of it as a Hospital by the Confederates, The Commissioners paid out the sum of fourteen hundred and ninety three dollars." <P>

<u>Commissioners of Free Schools, 1857-1864 and n.d.</u> (151 Items) <P>

	Consists mainly of returns to the commission by teachers at district schools listing names of students eligible for tuition and often listing the names of the parents.  Also includes correspondence relating to employment applications by teachers.  Includes an 1858 letter from T. Waties Dinkins to the board of trustees of the Sumterville Male Academy containing Dinkins's annual report as principal.  Includes several estimates and plans, May 1860, for building an addition to the Sumterville Male Academy and for repairing the original building. <P>

	Two oversize documents from this group, dated 15 October 1860 and 1863, were transferred to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History on 30 November 1981. <P>

	Evidently, Richardson acquired these records as part of the papers of W. F. B. Haynsworth, who was secretary treasurer of the free school board. <P>

<b>Sumterville Baptist Church Records, 1841-1872 (Bulk, 1850-1857) and N.D.</b> (59 ITEMS)<P>

	Consists largely of subscription lists of contributors toward the church building fund and accounts of labor and construction materials for the new church erected in 1854.  Originally, these records were papers of Elijah Pringle, chairman of the building committee.  Also includes letters responding to invitations to the September 1854 dedication service.  A few items relate to the hiring and pay of pastors.  A 27 May 1872 letter asks for letters of dismission for members withdrawing to organize the Timmonsville Baptist Church.  An undated manuscript lists names of black male and female members of the church and names of their masters.

<b>Militia Records, 1850 1853, 1861 1865, and N.D.</b> (20 items and 1 volume)<P>

	Consists of correspondence, orders, and rosters relating to various Sumter militia units.  Includes proceedings against defaulters with lists of names, letters concerning purchase of uniforms, and copies of general orders by Governor A. G. Magrath to the militia in March and April 1865.

	The single bound volume is a muster roll book of Beat No. 9, Sumter County Western Battalion, 20th Regiment, South Carolina Militia, 1861 63, including a printed muster roll of the Sumter County volunteer company raised at the very beginning of the war.  A notation by TER on the inside front cover says he found the book in the rubbish pile in Judge Fraser's barn.

<P>
<b>Sumter Telephone Company Records, 1895-1903</b> [Box 5, Folders 332-365; 1 bound volume]<P>

	Consists of telephone company correspondence and business records.  These records may have been papers of Richard B. Belser, who was secretary treasurer of the company.  They also include letters addressed to Dr. Samuel Chandler Baker, the company president.<P>

	The letters discuss the problems involved in launching a telephone business.  They include complaints from the public about unauthorized erection of poles on private property and linemen damaging trees in the city of Sumter.  Company financial records include an original stock certificate issued on 4 May 1895, telephone lease agreements, customers' account statements, a draft of the 1902 annual report to the stockholders, freight receipts, receipts for purchase of equipment and supplies, cancelled checks, and one bound volume  a ledger of collections for the company, 1898-1901.<P>

	These papers include an interesting assortment of business letterheads from the 1890s and early 1900s for manufacturers of electrical and telephone equipment, livery stables, banks, bicycle shops, and the like.

<P>
<b>Sumter District State Census, 1849</b><P>

	Consists of a book of legal forms and references that appears to have been owned first by Thomas B. Fraser (1847) and then by R. L. Cooper.  Its research value arises less from the legal matter than from a series of contemporary newspaper clippings reporting returns of the 1849 Sumter District state census.  The SC Archives lists no schedules for this census in its collection.  The census taker reported the returns by militia beats and published the data in the local paper to solicit corrections.  Someone [Judge Fraser?] compiled the clippings and pasted them in this volume.  TER appears to have added additional typescript lists [from the same census?] which he says he found in an old pamphlet.

<b>Sumter Kansas Association Records, 1856</b> (5 ITEMS)<P>

The resolution authorizes Major John W. Dargan, the leader of the Kansas emigrants, "to solicit contributions from the citizens of Sumter Dist., for the furtherance of the purposes of this association.  And that he be authorised to bring to his aid in the discharge of this duty any or all of the young men selected to accompany him as emigrants to Kansas."

<b>John McRae Papers</b> (31 Items and 14 Volumes)<P>


	Consists of the remnant of the John McRae library and papers that TER sold to the University of Wisconsin.  McRae, a Scottish born civil engineer and pioneer in railroad construction, was a resident of Camden who died in 1891 at the age of eighty two.  About ten years later, TER acquired his library and manuscripts, and sold the library, together with thirteen letterbooks, to the University of Wisconsin.  The letterbooks are now in the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Archives Division. <P>

	The remaining papers consist of manuscript fragments from letterpress copybooks, diaries, and surveyor's notebooks.  The copybook fragments date from the late nineteenth century, and the legible portions discuss family matters, genealogy, and contemporary politics. <P>

	"I am much more distressed upon the state of politics in this state," he wrote in one letter, "than encouraged by any success of the Democratic party north.  The northern Democratic is but little more friendly to us than the Republican.  If the project now suggested viz. namely to deprive the negro of the right to vote I almost believe it would be better for us to join the Republican party.  I feel more amazed about the dismissal of Hampton and more especially putting such a fellow as Irby who is as much of a b[l]ackguard as Tillman himself and a fit Lieutenant for him.  But this is a painfull business to think about." <P>

	One legible fragment, dated 25 April 1891 and addressed to John Paul and Company, Charleston, contains an order for Worcestershire sauce and other edibles:  "Please send me a Bbl crushed sugar, Six Qt Bottles Lea & Perrin's Sauce & Six large Bottles . . . Mustard.  I also send my demijohn for cottonseed oil."  The same page contains the copy of his check to John Paul and Company for $10.55. <P>

	An answer to a genealogical query from Duncan McRa of Kingwood, West Virginia, contains legible portions:  "If you can tell me what was your great grandfather's business or occupation was in Edinburg and if he left there any relations or connections when he came to America perhaps I ca[n] . . . something about your connection with the clan. . . . I don’t think we will be able to print another edition of the family history here but I have a nephew in Scotland who is an enthusiastic clansman & may perhaps publish a more full account of the clan.  I don’t know where Steedman got his information about the McRaes in Scotland, but Col. <u>Macara</u> of the 42d Highland Regiment who was killed at Quatre Bras was <u>not</u> a McRa.  I cannot find out anything about the other McRaes he names or his address."  Duncan McRa, the addressee of the letter, was the author of an 1891 descriptive handbook about Preston County, West Virginia. <P>

	Aside from these manuscript fragments, there are a number of bound volumes.  These include two of McRae's surveyor's notebooks: <P>

	[1]  "Compass Notes" relating to the Charleston and Hamburg Railroad, July 1845 (also contains plantation notes re property near Pine Tree Creek, 1866 85). <P>

	[2] "Plantation Levels," 1845 57. <P>

	In addition, McRae kept a series of plantation diaries in the form of miniature numbered notebooks averaging about forty pages.  Twelve of these exist for the period from 1868 to 1888. 
<blockquote>

	The content of the diaries is illustrated by these typical entries for October 1870: <P>

<P>
<b>Dutilh And Wachsmuth Records, 1779-1807, 1829-1870, and N.D.</b> (230 items)<P>

	Records of a Philadelphia shipping firm founded by Etienne Dutilh (1748-1810) aka Stephen Dutilh.  Includes documents in French, English, German, Spanish, and Italian, consisting of invoices, receipts, notes, bills of lading, bills of exchange, powers of attorney, and business and personal correspondence. <P>

	Dutilh was in business by 1784 and in partnership with John Godfried Wachsmuth during the 1790s.  At various times, his firm was known as E. Dutilh and Company, Dutilh and Wachsmuth, and E. Dutilh, Soullier and Company.  The firm traded with Europe, the West Indies, South America, Asia, and ports on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.  In addition to Etienne Dutilh's company records, these documents include papers (1829-1870) of insurance executive Charles Dutilh and merchant and art collector Charles Graff. <P>

	Much of the collection's South Carolina relevance arises from notarized copies of seven French language letters from Louis Newhouse, Charleston, SC, to Jean Gosuin, Liege, dated between 1 January 1785 and 26 March 1787.  The letters discuss Newhouse's apparent intention to sell fusils (rifles) and other arms; they make passing reference to proceedings of the South Carolina General Assembly and events on the southeastern borders. <P>

	Aside from the Newhouse letters, some records refer to a visit by ship's master William Davis to Charleston in January 1790, including a bill of exchange drawn by Davis on Dutilh and Wachsmuth payable to Jeremiah Candy and Company.  Also, the firm's account current with Captain Samuel Rinker, 19 April 1794, lists expenses and repairs in Charleston for his brig <u>Lydia</u> and records that while in port he sold 93 gallons of molasses and 90 gallons of rum. <P>

	Among the records that do not pertain to South Carolina, there are equally interesting items.  A legal document dated 10 February 1794 in Savannah, Georgia, grants a power of attorney by Marie Jeane Imbault de Marigai, widow of Jaques La Garde, lately an inhabitant of the Gros Morne, island of Santo Domingo.  The circumstances suggest that she might have been widowed there during the slave insurrection. <P>

	A letter from Captain Christopher Clousen from Surinam, 16 February 1795, transmits the discharge papers of seaman Richard Cripsin.  Two other Clousen letters, 22 February 1795 and 1 August 1795, exist in the Wichita State University Special Collections, and they recount that the British navy seized Clousen's ship <u>Hannibal</u> en route from Surinam to Amsterdam. <P>

	An invoice dated 22 December 1806 lists merchandise shipped on the <u>Coromandel</u>, commanded by John B. Davy, en route from Rangoon via Calcutta.  Davy's cargo consisted of earth oil (petroleum), ivory (202 elephant tusks), and raw silk. <P>

	The Philadelphia documents include an account of two publications ("Laws of the United States" and "Observations on Lord Sheffield's Pamphlet") Etienne Dutilh bought from bookseller Matthew Carey, and Dutilh's bill, 20 March 1799, for funeral expenses on the burial of Frances Dutilh. <P>

	Charles Graff's papers contain an auction bill for several paintings he bought in December 1836, including two by the seventeenth century Flemish artist David Teniers and one by the Dutch artist Jan Wynants.  A five page journal, 9 14 August 1845, recounts an excursion by Charles and Ann Graff from Philadelphia to Cape May, NJ, on board the steamer <u>Ohio</u>. <P>

	A letter from John Notman to Charles Dutilh, 29 March 1849, reports favorably on his inspection of the grave monument erected to [Charles?] Graff by Struthers and Son.  And Dutilh's papers for October and November 1849 report proceedings of the Towanda Bridge Company after a section of their bridge over the Susquehanna River was destroyed by fire. <P>

<P>
<b>British Legal Documents, 1683 1861</b> (17 ITEMS)<P>

	Consists mainly of wills, conveyances, and leases by persons in the English counties of Middlesex, Devon, Lincoln and Kent, and one copyright patent for improvements in obtaining products from seaweed.  A number of these documents devise property at specific street addresses in the city of London.  Actual dates of several of the manuscripts are uncertain, as some contain marginal notes identifying them as extracts by a proctor at Doctors Commons.  In addition, some of the manuscripts are fragments of Latin documents inscribed in court hand.<P>

	TER probably bought these manuscipts as a dealer's lot to gain possession of one particular item  a land conveyance in the county of Devon, dated 23 February 1765.  By this indenture, Joseph and Edmund Spettigue conveyed to Edward Hawkins Doidge the freehold of Whittaborough in Thrushelton Parish.   In the upper left corner, the document contains a sketch of the royal arms of George III.  At the bottom the Spettigues affixed their signet ring seals.  And in the left margin is a domestic British revenue stamp dating from the same year that saw riots over "stamped paper" in the American colonies.  A note found among TER's papers indicates that he was interested in collecting old British revenue stamps.

<b>Appendix: Inventory of Bound Volumes</b><P>

	This is a complete inventory of the bound volumes in the Thomas E. Richardson Collection.  Some of the descriptions given here have also been included above under the appropriate sub series to which they belong.  Richardson's personal papers sometimes appear in the same volume with material he collected, so the series classification is in some cases arbitrary.<P>


	<u>Series One: Thomas Eveleigh Richardson Papers</u><P>

	The collection includes a nine volume set of letterpress copybooks of Richardson's outgoing correspondence:
<blockquote>
	[1] May 1897-February 1903 (includes one letter dated 		September 1904) <br>
	[2] March 1900 (small volume, includes want lists of books) <br>
	[3] March 1901-November 1904 (bulk, April-November 1904) <br>
	[4] July 1902-April 1904 (includes "The James Families of St. Marks Parish")<br>
	[5] November 1904-October 1906<br>
	[6] November 1906-July 1910<br>
	[7] April 1910-September 1915 (includes records of the 		Carolina Cotton Company, September-November 1891) <br>
	[8] September 1915-October 1923<br>
	[9] December 1923-June 1928, December 1932-April 1933<br>
</blockquote>
	In addition, Richardson copied some correspondence into the blank pages of a county auditor's letterpress copybook he found in the Sumter County Courthouse.  His letters begin on page 154 of the book and include material from 1911, 1920, and 1925-27.  The Sumter County auditor's office correspondence is indexed in the front of the book and covers the period 1880-1889.<P>

	Richardson's records as an insurance agent include three ledger books of information about clients and prospective clients  birth dates, occupations, and places of residence.  These cover the dates 1889-91, 1891-92, and 1892-94.  The people TER canvassed included Charles Pinckney's great grandson, who was employed as traveling salesman for a safe company, and future SC governor Thomas G. McLeod, who was a schoolteacher at Lynchburg. <P>

	One insurance ledger book lists the names of clients insured during the period 27 June 1893-11 May 1897 and records premium payments. <P>

	Three insurance voucher receipt books cover the dates Oct 1889-Apr 1890, May 1890-Jan 1891, and Feb-Dec 1891. <P>

	Some of the volumes relate to Richardson's term as manager for the Santee Club.  Two diaries/memorandum books cover the dates 10 May 1897 8 Feb 1899 and Oct 1898-Jan 1899.  An account book of the yacht "Santee" with C. L. Ford, 1898 1899, lists supplies purchased for the yacht/houseboat the club maintained for the use of members. <P>

	A copy of the <u>Seventh Annual Report of the South Carolina Industrial School to the General Assembly for the Fiscal Year 1915</u> contains notations and insertions relating to TER's efforts as probate judge to promote funding for the institution.  These include a letter, 16 February 1916, from TER to Neill O'Donnell, foreman of the 1916 Sumter Grand Jury, a letter, 14 February 1916, from magistrate K. E. Wells to TER, and newspaper clippings.  TER's handwritten comments indicate he thought the General Assembly was spending money on alcohol enforcement that should have been spent on child welfare. <P>

	An account book of the William Mayrant estate, 1840-1852, 1884-1885, probably belongs with TER's personal papers.  Mayrant was TER's grandfather, and the later entries in this volume date from the time when TER was acting as executor of his mother Sarah Mayrant Richardson's estate. <P>

	TER's scrapbook clippings, containing mainly items of historical or genealogical interest. <P>

	Miscellaneous personal volumes include: <P>

	One membership ledger, National Mutual Relief Association Local Board, Sumter, SC, 1895, Altamont Moses, local secretary (TER appears on membership roll). <P>

	Three wrapped packages of bank books, 1852-1903, 1896-1904, 1893-1922. <P>

	Receipt book, Sumter Building and Loan Association, 1888-1891 (includes constitution and by laws). <P>

	Two account books with the Simonds National Bank of Sumter. <P>

	One memorandum book, n.d. <P>

	One memorandum book, 1896, 1901.  Contains list of survivors of Garden's Battery, CSA, April 1896.  Reverse end contains book memoranda, 1901, apparently relating to acquisitions, sales, and want lists. <P>

	A list of rare books belonging to TER, 28 May 1902 (includes TER's genealogical notes on the Moore family). <P>

	One volume of "Notes  Historical & Genealogical" by TER containing mostly blank pages but with two pages of information on the Singleton and James families. <P>

	One largely blank letterpress copybook TER found among the papers of Oscar M. Lieber (whose library he bought).  Contains a few book lists, some genealogical notes, and a flyleaf notation indicating what was happening in Sumter the day TER first tried out the copying quality of the paper. <P>

	One account book, 1880-1889, contains a page of historical notes by TER (p. 47) on antebellum cotton factories in Sumter District. <P>

	TER's scrapbook clippings, containing mainly items of historical or genealogical interest. <P>

<u>Series Two: Thomas E. Richardson Historical Collections</u><P>

	Two volumes contain militia and/or census data for Sumter County in the mid nineteenth century.  Both of them were owned at one time by Judge Thomas B. Fraser, whose papers ended up in TER's possession.  They consist of<P>

	[1] One muster roll book of Beat No. 9, Sumter County Western Battalion, 20th Regiment, South Carolina Militia, 1861-63, including a printed muster roll of the Sumter County volunteer company raised at the very beginning of the war.  A notation by TER on the inside front cover says he found the book in the rubbish pile in Judge Fraser's barn. <P>

	[2] One book of legal forms and references that appears to have been owned first by Thomas B. Fraser (1847) and then by R. L. Cooper.  Its research value arises less from the legal matter than from a series of contemporary newspaper clippings reporting returns of the 1849 Sumter District state census.  The SC Archives lists no schedules for this census in its collection.  The census taker reported the returns by militia beats and published the data in the local paper to solicit corrections.  Someone [Judge Fraser?] compiled the clippings and pasted them in this volume.  TER appears to have added additional typescript lists [from the same census?] which he says he found in an old pamphlet. <P>

	<u>Miller's Planters' and Merchants' Almanac for the Year of Our Lord 1851</u>.  Signature, "W. H. B. Richardson."  Contains entries in pencil opposite the dates, e. g., Sunday, 24 August, "Horrid Tornado.  My Friend the Revd. C. P. Elliott fell a victim to its fury  a Noble & Exalted Christian was he indeed." <P>

	<u>Miller's Planters' and Merchants' Almanac for the Year 1853</u>.  Signature, "D. A. Richardson."  Contains handwritten inventories of poultry and household furnishings.  A list of slaves' names and ages follows the month of December.  One of the back flyleaves contains the upside down notation, "Cut out Negro Shirts on Tuesday the 14th of Feby 1854." <P>

	L. L. Fraser, Jr.'s legal notebook: "Notebook of Questions on and Matters Pertaining to Law," Columbia, SC, 10 April 1848.  (Ladson Lawrence Fraser was Thomas B. Fraser's brother; in 1848, he was studying law in Columbia under Chancellor James J. Caldwell). <P>

	One commonplace book with most of the pages torn out.  The remaining pages contain receipts for baked custard, Welsh pudding, rice pudding, and cranberry jelly. <P>

	Record book of H. Wates, 1856-57 (includes birth dates of children, expense accounts, and lists of livestock). <P>

	One anonymous college student's expense account book, 1896 1901 (apparently a USC student). <P>

	One anonymous business letterbook, 1900-1901. <P>

	D. L. Alexander receipt book, 1901-1905 (Alexander was TER's brother in law). <P>

	Receipt book of C. W. Miller, sales agent for the Singer Sewing Machine Company, 1874 (Much of the boxed dated correspondence for the 1870s concerns Miller's sales business for Singer in Marion, SC). <P>

	One volume recording dam levels for plantations near the Wateree Swamp, 1882, 1887. <P>

	Ledger of collections for the Sumter Telephone Company, 1898-1901. <P>

	One civil engineering notebook with inscription by William J. Lewis on inside cover: "Book by Right of Flotsam & Jetsam." (probably mid nineteenth century; the owner may have been Judge William Lewis). <P>

	One memorandum book, 1864-1872, cover and part of pages (?) missing, contains entries of Confederate soldiers' names and dated entries relating to planting and livestock. <P>

	One account book, 1854-59. <P>

	One account book, 1854-57. <P>

	One account book containing statement of purchase of John White land. <P>

	One memorandum book with all entries crossed out, 1840-1844. <P>

	One memorandum book, 1842. <P>

	One memorandum book, n.d. <P>

	One leatherbound book with receipt tucked in its blank pages: "Capt. W. G. Richardson to Jno. Pitts admr est J. Pitts, 10 Jan 1842."  Richardson was TER's grandfather. <P>


	<u>The John McRae Papers</u><P>

	The most significant set of volumes aside from TER's own letterbooks is the remnant of the John McRae library and papers.  McRae, a Scottish born civil engineer and pioneer in railroad construction, was a resident of Camden who died in 1891 at the age of eighty two.  About ten years later, TER acquired his library and manuscripts, and sold the library together with thirteen or more letterbooks to the University of Wisconsin.  Fortunately, a set of McRae's diaries and surveyor's notes remained in TER's possession. <P>

	Twelve diaries survive for the period from 1868 to 1888:
<blockquote>
	No. 25: 1 Jan 21 July 1868<br>
	No. 27: 1 Feb 31 Aug 1869<br>
	No. 28: 1 Sept 1869 31 Mar 1870<br>
	No. 29: 1 Apr 30 Nov 1870<br>
	No. 30: 1 Dec 1870 31 May 1871<br>
	No. 31: 1 Jun 1 Nov 1871<br>
	No. 33: 1 May 30 Sep 1872<br>
	No. 34: 1 Oct 1872 28 Feb 1873<br>
	No. 35: 1 Mar 22 Jul 1873<br>
	No. 36: 23 Jul 30 Nov 1873<br>
	No. 39: 1 Jul 31 Oct 1874<br>
	No. __: 1 Apr 31 Aug 1888
</blockquote>
	Two surveyor's notebooks also survive: <P>

	[1] "Compass Notes" relating to the Charleston and Hamburg Railroad, July 1845 (also contains plantation notes re property near Pine Tree Creek, 1866-85). <P>

	[2] "Plantation Levels," 1845-57. <P>
