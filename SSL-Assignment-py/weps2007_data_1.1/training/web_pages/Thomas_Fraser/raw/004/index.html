      The line up for the annual Thomas Fraser Tribute Concerts is taking shape. The concerts are being held this year on the 9th, 10th and 11th of November at Burra Isle. Already booked is Jimmie Rodger's relative and nephew of Elsie McWilliams, Mr Rick McWilliams, from Meridian, Mississippi.

Crack Glasgow bluegrass outfit the Moonshiners are scheduled to play their second consecutive Thomas Fraser concert while Arthur Pottinger and Eddie Williamson complete the list of performers flying into Shetland in November.

Punctuating the film - which contains many stunning shots of Orkney's landscape - area series of vignettes in which a number of islanders are asked to consider their impact on the planet - are they a cowboy or a spaceman? The film contains music from Thomas Fraser. In a curious aside, cowboys and spacemen were two of Thomas's favourite subject matters.

This from Red Lick Records in England: &quot;Two absolutely brilliant&nbsp; CDs! Recorded from 1953 to 1977 by a crofter/fisherman from the Shetland Islands, these are stellar performances of old time music in the style of Jimmie Rodgers, The Delmore Brothers, Hank Williams etc. Just one man and his guitar having a whoopin&iacute; good time&nbsp; wailing out the good old songs into his reel to reel tape recorder for no better reason than he loved the music and loved to play it! After his death, aged 50, in 1978, the tapes of his stunning legacy lay undisturbed for years until his grandson found them and decided they should be heard. Damn right! These great CDs contain music filled with all the power and passion of the originals . A truly fabulous release that will leave traditional country music fans in ecstasy!&quot;</p>
