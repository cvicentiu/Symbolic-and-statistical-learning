    HUGH FRASER</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>BIRTH 
    Born to Thomas Fraser, a dyer and also at one time a miller and Mary Elder, 
    at 52 Tomnahurich Street, Inverness on 23 April 1868, he was one of several 
    Hugh Frasers born in that Parish, that year, showing the popularity of a few 
    Clan Fraser of Lovat names, such as Simon, Hugh and Thomas, that go back into 
    Clan history for hundreds of years, thus giving genealogists a hard time, 
    it's easier to find a Smith in Inverness, than a Fraser. My Great Grandfather 
    had been employed as a dyer, miller and general labourer in his lifetime and 
    my Great Grandmother was from a long established Inverness family. There's 
    a possibility his father Thomas had several siblings but I've only had contact 
    from a descendant of William and a descendant of John born, Lochend, Inverness 
    14 February 1839. John and his wife worked at, what was then, Inverness's 
    Asylum and it's possible Hugh's sister, Catherine born Inverness 31 August 
    1857, also worked there.</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>YOUTH 
    Hugh is next found in the 1881 census at 15 Telford Street, Inverness, which 
    still stands, with his parents and 3 siblings, he's still at school, as is, 
    interestingly, his 16 year old sister Ann and Donaldina must have been named 
    after their Grandfather, Donald Fraser. Source: FHL Film 0203421 GRO Ref Volume

    Whilst I haven't researched them, I believe he had another 4 siblings, Catherine 
    b 1857, Mary Ann b 1861, Margaret, her twin and Mary b 1862. We also believe 
    the family to be Gaelic speaking and the fact his parents, both from Inverness, 
    were married in the East Free Church of Scotland, on the 26 December 1856, 
    adds to this belief.</b></font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>There's 
    a gap in the records till the 5th of January 1899 when Hugh enlisted in the 
    Black Watch and went to the Boer War. It's always a puzzle as to why a Gaelic 
    speaking Lovat Fraser would join a Scots speaking regiment from outside its 
    traditional area, although there is an historic link, an entire company of 
    the original regiment was formed in 1716 by The Old Fox himself, the 11th 
    Lord Lovat, then in usual controversial manner, he was removed but reappointed 
    and raised a new company in 1725, of what was then called the Independent 
    Highland Companies. However, in Granddad's "Militia Attestation" form, he 
    does state he previously served in the Royal Highlanders i.e. the Black Watch, 
    before and his roll number of 7047 may show an enrolment of about 1885. If 
    he was a career soldier for part of the missing 17 years, then before the 
    war the battalion was in Dublin in December 1886 on garrison duty, September 
    1888 Belfast, April 1891 Limerick, January 1893 Glasgow, 1894 Edinburgh, 1896 
    York, 1898 Aldershot, 2 January 1900, sailed for South Africa from either 
    Portsmouth or Dublin. </b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ARMY RECORD 
    His 5th January 1889 Militia Attestation or enrolment form shows him to be 
    living at 4 Duff Street, Inverness, where his parents died in 1902, so it 
    looks like they had moved from Telford Street (1881 census) and he was living 
    at the family home, was 30 years and 9 months, labouring for a Mr Connor, 
    single no children and was enrolling in the 3rd Battalion Royal Highlanders, 
    Perth, as a militiaman, for a minimum of 4 years. He was 5'6, 140 lbs, fresh 
    complexion and brown hair. Hugh's Statement of Services states, 3rd Royal 
    Highland Reenlisted 19/6/99, Militia Reserve 4/7/99, embodied 14/12/99 to 
    25/8/1902, posted with the 2nd Battalion 3/1/1900 to 25/8/02. Sometimes the 
    handwriting is difficult to read but one note seems to read, 3rd reformed 
    after SA (I assume South Africa) 25/8/1902 disembodied, then this is covered 
    with another note that could say he was paid his Hats? Gratuity for months 
    of August September 02. Then in flowing handwriting on behalf of his Adjutant, 
    "Discharged Ter. of Engl, 4/1/03. Character - Very sm," whatever that means. 
    Finally, his Military History Sheet also gives his service abroad, Rank-Private, 
    in South Africa, from 3/1/1900 to 25/8/02, including embarkation and disembarkation, 
    so he'd been away when his mother died on 29th April 1902. The sections on 
    wounds, injuries, gallant conduct are blank, obviously a sensible man. </b></font></p>

    1899-1902: I've no idea what exactly he did in the war and can only give an 
    overview of what happened, it was an unjust war, with one powerful country 
    wanting an excuse to seize rich natural assets, this time gold, which is still 
    being repeated in history, to this day, so little lessons were learnt. Black 
    Africans fought on both sides with promises of reward, for after the war but 
    received none. On 11 December 1899, after war was declared on the 11 October, 
    the British Army, under the incompetent General Methuen, suffered a defeat 
    at Magersfontein. The Black Watch, as did the rest of the Highland Brigade, 
    fought bravely but the Boers were fighting for their lands and held against 
    a more powerful force. There was a battle at Koodoesberg on 18th February 
    1900, where 2,400 Boers were captured, the Battalion entered Bloemfontein 
    on the 15 March and soon after new recruits arrived, doubling the strength 
    of the Battalion from 450. In May they were besieged at Heilbron but the poaching 
    skills of the Lovat Scouts, the Fraser mounted regiment, kept them fed and 
    was equal to any mounted Boer. </b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>After 
    the fall of Pretoria, the Boer capital, on 5 June, the Black Watch were allocated 
    to "pacification duties" in the Orange Free State and by August they had covered 
    1,000 miles on foot with 2,000 ahead of them, whilst the enemy fought a mounted 
    guerrilla war, with constant sniping and long range bombardment. Although, 
    in July they had been involved in some fierce fighting leading to the capture 
    or death of 4,000 Boers at Retiefs Nek. In October the tactics were changed 
    to "cordoning off" and the Black Watch joined a cordon near Ladybrand, they 
    were transported by train after all that marching, did this little luxury 
    lead to Hugh working on the railway later in life? They spent the next year 
    there, 2 months in Natal, then moved to Harrismith, where, for a short time, 
    the 1st Battalion, that had been in India, joined them. On 31st May 1902, 
    the Boers finally surrendered, there had never been more than 65,000 of them, 
    against 440,000 men from throughout the Empire. Concentration camps were also 
    used against civilians, using an idea previously tested by the Americans.

    He married Jessie (Janet) Duff, (born Aberdeen 27 August 1868) under special 
    licence, at 94 Castle Street, Dennistoun Glasgow, 17th October 1902, he was 
    a railway labourer and she could've been working at Glenco, Bearsden, as he 
    sent her his medals there. They have both their addresses on the marriage 
    certificate as 276 Castle Street, Glasgow and looking at Granddad's discharge 
    date of the 25th August, he must have gone up to Glasgow, after disembarkation, 
    got a job and got married in under two months, no mean feat in those days, 
    so it must have been love. I've no proof how an Invernessian met this Aberdonian 
    in 19th century Scotland but I have a strong theory. Jessie had a brother 
    Alexander, there is an A Duff who enrolled in the Black Watch about the same 
    time as Granddad and there is some family anecdotal evidence about an uncle 
    being in the army and forever getting promoted and demoted, like a yoyo, so 
    if this A Duff is the brother, then, that's how they met. </b></font></p>

    18 Duff Street (my brother and I always thought dad was pulling our legs, 
    by claiming to be born on Burns Day), Hugh signed the birth certificate so 
    he was still in Inverness in 1906. The next record was a picture post card 
    to Grandma's brother Alexander Duff, at 24 Allan Street, Aberdeen (later to 
    become our family home for 40 years) from Hugh in Miniota, Manitoba, Canada, 
    June 1908. He was away from his family, working, laying the Grand Trunk Railway 
    (Pacific?), which was merged into the Canadian National Railways, by the Canadian 
    Government in the 1920s, due to the bankruptcy of a number of railways and 
    is now their main transcontinental line. </b></font></p>

    the name is Sioux, "minnie", meaning water and "ota", plenty. The first train 
    went through Miniota to Melville, Saskatchewan in September 1908 and a daily 
    passenger service established, which fits with the dates of Hugh working there.

    offered $75 a month the next year. Uno, a cut sixty-nine feet deep, was filled 
    using wheelbarrows, carts and scrapers. The carts were one horse drawn. The 
    only mechanization was a steam shovel which dumped the fill into a chute. 
    This steam shovel came up to Miniota on the C.P.R and was taken out at Miniota 
    on a track laid ahead of it, picking up the back sections and laying them 
    ahead. It was fired with coal. The dirt froze so hard that the steam shovel 
    dug it up In Such big lumps they would upset the little carts, so it quit

    LIFE We know Hugh returned to Scotland, our first known place is Fordoun, 
    near Brechin, my late cousin Mary had a book that her mum Jessie Reston was 
    given at school there and dad also told me about it. Mary's sister, Nancy 
    thought our Granddad was a signalman at some point (maybe his final illness 
    took him to a less strenuous job) but he was classed as a Wagon Repairer, 
    on his death certificate. The next place we have the family, is Addiewell 
    and I'd guess he would have been working for London Midland Scottish Railways, 
    as they had lines in Fordoun and near Addiewell. He died at, Brucehill, Addiewell, 
    West Calder, Midlothian, Scotland, aged 48, with Carcinoma of Stomach, lasting 
    eight months, on 8 June 1916 and is buried at West Calder Cemetery. Neither 
    Hugh or his wife Jessie, who was buried in Aberdeen, alongside her brother 
    and sister-in-law, Mary Ann Copeland, had headstones but one was placed at 
    Hugh's grave by my Reston cousins and my brother Colin and I put a vase on 
    our grandmother's. We've often wondered whether it was simple poverty or some 
    religious reason that no headstones were erected and it remains an unsolved 
    puzzle. If you've been following Jessie's story, return for her life after

    wood mill labourer in the 1871 census and at the time of Jessie's birth, a 
    granite polisher. Mum Jessie was a wool mill worker in 1868 and a laundress 
    in the 1881 census. </b></font></p>

    She had one sibling Alexander born in Aberdeen 20 November 1863, they were 
    both illegitimate, Alexander snr was a widower but there's no trace of him 
    marrying Jessie snr, who was 12 years younger than him, why they didn't marry, 
    we've no idea. Jessie snr took the name Duff and even claimed to be a widow, 
    so apart from legality the marriage seems a normal one. Alexander snr died 
    in 1872 but don't know when Jessie snr died but she was still alive when Jessie 
    married in 1902. In the 1881 census she was 13, living in a now demolished 
    tenement in Aberdeen and was a message girl to a drapers. <br>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I've nothing 
    written about her till her marriage in Glasgow, 1902 but I've found a photo 
    of her on her own in 1887, she was quite an attractive woman, taken at the 
    Munro Rembrandt Studio, in Aberdeen, one with her mother taken in Aberdeen 
    but not dated, although could be a similar period, then one of her in 1898 
    taken at the William Ross studios, Glasgow. So that puts her in Glasgow in 
    that year, the Boer War hadn't yet started, her future husband was in Inverness 
    on 5/1/1899 but we do know he sent his Boer War medals to her at someplace 
    called Glenco in Glasgow, so we guess she was in service and they already 
    knew each other but how she met and married my Grandad Hugh Fraser, we can't 
    prove but go to the <a href="frasergrand.html#Marr"><i>Marriage</i></a> section on Hugh's 
    history to find out what happened to her, till Hugh's death in 1916 and read 
    my theory on how they met. Interestingly, her dad is said to be Alexander 
    Duff, on her wedding certificate, her mum's married name was Duff and whilst 
    my Gt Grandmother was still alive when the wedding took place in Glasgow in 
    1902, there's no evidence she attended.<a name="Jess"></a></b></font></p>

    </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ANOTHER LIFE 
    After her husband's death due to cancer in 1916, we understand she stayed 
    around the West Calder area and raised her two children. Her son, Thomas, 
    my father, worked at one of the local pits and was involved in the General 
    Strike, there is a reference from a George McDougal, manager of the Loganlea 
    Colliery, Addiewell, by West Calder dated 25/6/1927, at some point he also 
    worked at the famous Caledonian Hotel, in Edinburgh. We don't know exactly 
    when dad and grandmother moved to Aberdeen but it was within a year of that 
    letter. Her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Duff nee Copeland, died on or around, 
    27 June 1927 and her brother, Alexander Duff on or around 14 May 1928, union 
    records from the now GMB Union show dad joined the union in 1928, at the Aberdeen 
    Municipal Gas Company, I understand from a niece of dad's, Mary or Nancy, 
    his sister Jessie had been in service with a Dr Gracie from 12 years and it 
    was through his friend, dad got the job. They took over the tenancy of the 
    top floor tenement flat, from Alexander, at 24 Allan Street, where the family 
    lived till 1967. Her daughter Jessie Elder Duff stayed in West Lothian and 
    married a miner, Dave Reston but there must have been a fair coming and going, 
    as the eldest two of young Jessie's five children, Harry and Nancy, were born 
    in Aberdeen, young Jessie and Dave having stayed in Aberdeen with my dad and 
    Grandmother, as Harry was born in 1931 this must have been soon after the 
    move, it must have been quite a crowded tenement. </b></font></p>

    STREET Our tenement in Aberdeen was small, mum and dad had their bed in the 
    living/dining room, which also had the only sink, there was a small room off 
    it for cooking and the po, for late night pees and a small pantry in the tiny 
    entrance hall. Grandma slept in a small box room, separated from the room 
    where my brother Colin and I shared a bed settee, by a curtain. The toilet 
    was shared with the family next door and down a flight of inside stairs and 
    then an outside one, past that was the shared washhouse, another set of stairs 
    took you to the coalhouse, common green and individual allotments. There were 
    six flats sharing number 24, one of the only two tenements in Allan Street 
    with a rear entrance, instead of a front close. </b></font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>THE WAR 
    All the photos of her I've seen, have Grandma in a black full-length dress, 
    a mark of being a widow and she never remarried, my late cousin Nancy's husband 
    George Young, once remarked "she was a ghostly apparition, gliding along, 
    it certainly gave me a scare", the fact George knew her in the 50s helps confirm 
    that she moved back and forth, staying with her son in Aberdeen and daughter 
    in Livingstone Station and later in Blackburn, near Bathgate. Here my cousin 
    Davina Doove, young Jessie's daughter, now in Vancouver, helps me out with 
    the tale, she says, "we lived in Livingstone Station, in somebody's bedroom, 
    seven people. Tom, my brother, was only about a year old, I was four, when 
    Grandma came for either to stay or a holiday, I remember her coming into the 
    room and swinging me around, I also have memories of crumpets or pancakes 
    she brought that had a thick lump of butter in the middle, it was also wartime. 
    I can't remember if she stayed for long but it was shortly after that we moved, 
    as we'd got a new house". Davina's description fits in with my dad being called 
    up to the RAF, then soon after that, my mum and brother moving to Edinburgh, 
    so it looks like Grandma moved, for at least a reasonable period, leaving 
    Allan Street empty. There's also a letter from my dad to mum, written the 
    day he sailed for the Far East, Wednesday 15th November 1943, mentioning mum 
    and Colin making visits to Auntie Jessie's in Livingstone. As for the pancake, 
    I'm pretty sure it was a Rowie/Buttery Roll, for if anyone tastes this culinary 
    delight, unique to the North East of Scotland, the memory stays with you for 
    life.</b></font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>AFTER 
    THE WAR Davina continues, "I remember grandma staying with us in our new house 
    for quite a few years and she moved with us to Blackburn, not far from Livingstone. 
    Then the doctor told my mother it was too much for her, so Grandma had to 
    go into a home. She was in it for a few years before she died. It was sad 
    that my mother and Grandma didn't speak much to each other. My mother loved 
    her dad and he died when she was twelve and two days, I think she left home 
    soon after to work at the mine, then went to stay in richer peoples houses, 
    as a sort of housekeeper". This piece of the jigsaw of Grandma's life fits 
    in with my memories, her sisters, Mary and Nancy's and Nancy's husband, George 
    Young. I've fond memories of holidaying at the house at 43 Riddochhill Crescent, 
    Blackburn, it was like a palace after Allan Street and I still remember this 
    toon loon hearing his first cuckoo there, we drove past it a year or so back 
    and it still looks loved and well cared for but the ambience of the village 
    has gone, with the ubiquitous Glasgow overspill. It seems Grandma lived for 
    long periods at Allan Street and Blackburn and when she became too old for 
    her daughter, Jessie Elder Reston nee Fraser or my father, to care for, she 
    went to an old folks home, I can't remember any visits to a home in West Lothian 
    and can only assume she went straight to Maud Hospital in Aberdeenshire. </b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MAUD She 
    spent her last days in Maud hospital, an old Poor House converted to a geriatric 
    hospital by the NHS. I'll always remember the long rail journey and the long 
    walk from the station, dad couldn't drive then and few people we knew had 
    cars. We'd then see this frail old lady lying there, wearing a light coloured 
    nightdress, instead of the usual black garments. She died on 25 October 1958, 
    aged 90 but dad had taken her back to the city of her birth, she died at Allan 
    Street, where she spent so many years of her life. She is buried at Allenvale 
    cemetery, Aberdeen, where she joined her brother Alexander and his wife, Mary 
    Copeland. Like her husband's her grave it had no headstone, we don't know 
    the reason why but my brother and I have now added a memorial vase to the 
    graveside.</b></font></p>
