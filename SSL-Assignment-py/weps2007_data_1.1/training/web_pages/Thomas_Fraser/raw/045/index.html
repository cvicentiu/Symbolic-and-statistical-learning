<P>
<B><BIG>John Fraser, Sr. was born in December 1764 at Muirton, Scotland.
The earliest history of the Fraser family is recorded in the memoirs of John
Fraser as dictated to and recorded by his son, Simon Fraser. </BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>According to these records John Fraser was born in Muirton, which
is located one mile west from the city of Inverness, Scotland. His father
was named John Fraser and his grandfather was named John Fraser. His great,
grandfather was named Alexander Fraser. The Fraser family lived at Muirton,

<FONT COLOR="Purple"><B><BIG>THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<B><BIG>John Fraser had one brother named Simon who died about 1820. Simon
Fraser had one son named John Fraser. John Fraser, the nephew, was a school
master in the Highlands of Scotland where he raised a large family.
</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>John Fraser had one sister named Margaret who was deaf and dumb from
infancy. Margaret lived with her brother John all her life. She died in 1835
at the age of 81 years. At the time of her death, John was living in York,
Livingston County, New York.</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>In addition to his brother and sister, John Fraser had a number of
half brothers and sisters because his mother had been married before her
marriage to his father.</BIG></B>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="Purple"><B><BIG>THE MARRIAGE TO MARY
MacDONALD</BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<B><BIG>John Fraser married Mary MacDonald about 1794. There is a separate
piece of paper included with the memoirs which says the date was the 25 Dec
1790. At the time of marriage John was thirty years old and his bride was
26 years old. </BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>Mary MacDonald had a least three brothers, one brother named John
MacDonald, was killed with a musket ball passing through his lungs in a battle
in Spain, near Saragossa (renamed Zaragoza, which is located in Aragon region
of northeastern Spain). </BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>Mary MacDonald's second brother, Dugald MacDonald was reported to
been slain in Holland. Her third brother, George MacDonald, went on an expedition
to Egypt, fought in the battle of the Nile, survived and sailed on an expedition
to Jamaica in the West Indies and was reported to have died in this area.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="Purple"><B><BIG>THE MOVE TO AMERICA</BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<B><BIG>After their oldest daughter died of small pox at the age of 7 in
1801, John and Mary Fraser decided it was time to emigrate to America. John
and Mary left their native home on the 3 Aug 1803 and started the long journey
to America. In the traveling party were seven person including John's sister,
Margaret Fraser and a 7 day old baby named Simon J. Fraser. They sailed from
the port of Glasgow in a British ship named "Mercury from Kircardt". The
fare to America was 10 Guineas per head except for the baby. A Guinea was
a British gold coin worth one pound and one shilling.</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>A son Thomas Fraser provides another version of the move to America:
</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>"John and Mary Fraser migrated from Inverness, Scotland, on the
'Trapper'. They sailed from Greenock on the 8 Sep 1803 and landed in New
York in early 1804."</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>After a trip of many weeks they arrived in New York. There they traveled
by sloop to Albany, New York then by land to Johnstown, where they remained
till about the last of February, 1804. From Johnstown, they traveled by sleigh
to East Bloomfield where a daughter named Mary died and was buried.
</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>From East Bloomfield they moved to Wheatland, Monroe County and stayed
at the home of a John McNaughton. From his home they were able to explore
the wilderness area for a farm. John Fraser located a farm, build a shanty,
and moved his remaining family in the middle of March. In this area, there
were five families from his native Scotland, so they named the town Inverness
after their native Scotland town. Later records indicate this area was known
as Caledonia, Genesee County, New York.</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>By the time John and Mary Fraser had settled, they had spend all
their money. But with hard work and perseverance they lived to make over
100 acres in cultivation and they also made many improvements to the homestead.
</BIG></B>

<FONT COLOR="Purple"><B><BIG>THE LAST YEARS</BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<B><BIG>John Fraser died on the 24 Oct 1847. He was buried in cemetery located
about a mile from his farmhouse in the Inverness area of Livingston County,
New York. His grave was marked by a slab of marble. John's wife, Mary died
on the 24 Aug 1858 and was also buried in the cemetery near Inverness. In
a letter dated 26 Mar 1988, Judson P. Mason stated the following:</BIG></B>
<P>
<B><BIG>"We did find the cemetery, near York, Livingston County, and have
seen their grave markers. If I deciphered the markers, correctly, Mary Fraser
was born 1771 and died 24 July 1858."</BIG></B>
