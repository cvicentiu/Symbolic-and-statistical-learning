the fine line between fact and fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During

&quot;Jane
Maxwell was born at Monreith in 1749, the fourth of six children of Sir William
Maxwell, the third baronet of Monreith and his wife Magdalene Blair of Blair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father, the third baronet, has been depicted as a drunk who allowed
his family to exist in poverty in Edinburgh while he sold most of his estate to
make ends meet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A fictitious novel
even suggested that he owned a whisky still at Monreith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Jane aged 11, and Eglantyne aged 9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
Jane reached 16 she was strikingly beautiful and had a song written about her
called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonny Jenny of Monreith, the Flower

deeply in love for the first and probably only time with a young officer who has

the next 20 years the Duke and Duchess lived at Gordon Castle in Morayshire
which her husband enlarged until it was one of the largest homes in
Scotland.&nbsp; Part of the town of Fochabers had to be demolished and rebuilt
elsewhere to make way for the extensions.&nbsp; She had five children at two
year intervals.&nbsp; Her first, George, Marquis of Huntly, was born in
1770.&nbsp; The Duke also had an illegitimate son at about the same time, also
called George, by a Mrs Christie.&nbsp; Jane used to refer to 'my George and the
Duke's George.'</span></font></p>

entertained on a lavish scale with as many as a hundred guests for dinner, with
some staying for three months in the Castle.&nbsp; In the 1780s the Duchess
started entertaining in Edinburgh and quickly became the leading hostess.&nbsp;
When the Gordons came to London in 1787, Jane continued her party giving habit,
but made everyone dance Scottish dances.&nbsp; King George III loved her...</span></font></p>

1793 the army was short of recruits and she had a bet with the Prince Regent
that she could raise more men than he.&nbsp; Her recruiting technique was, to
say anything, unusual.&nbsp; She wore a military uniform and a large, black,
feathered hat.&nbsp; She toured Scotland going from market place to market place
organising reels.&nbsp; Anyone who joined the reel, joined the army, and
received the King's shilling, the recruiting payment, from between the Duchess's
lips by kissing her.&nbsp; This was how the Gordon Highlanders were
founded.&nbsp; Her total was 940 men.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;In
1799 she became depressed and ill.&nbsp; Her eldest son, George, had gone off to
the wars.&nbsp; Her second son, Alexander, died aged 23, and her husband had now
moved his friend Jean Christie into Gordon Castle and built a small house on the
Spey called Kinrara for his estranged wife, who lived there for the next six
years...&quot;</span></font></p>

Christie, 'fifth Duchess of Gordon,' was a woman of humble birth and parentage,
who resided in Fochabers.&nbsp; Her good looks and handsome person fascinated
Duke Alexander long before the death of the fourth Duchess, the Lady Jane
Maxwell; and probably not the least romantic part of Jean Christie's history is
that almost at the very moment of her being united to a man in her own station
of life, a carriage drove to the door of the cottage, where the marriage party
was assembled, and Jean was abducted and carried off from her betrothed.&nbsp;
She bore nine children to Duke Alexander, to whom, 'after proclamation on three
several Sabbaths,' she was married 'on the 30th day of July 1820, by the Rev.
William Rennie, minister of the parish of Bellie.'&nbsp; According to the Bellie
Register of Burials, 'Jean Christie, Duchess of Gordon, Second Wife to
Alexander, Fourth Duke of Gordon,' was interred at Bellie upon the 2d August
1824, 'aged 54 years.'&nbsp; Her body was laid in a vault, under a handsome
mausoleum of Elgin freestone, with canopy, supported by twelve pillars.&nbsp;
Her name is not recorded; but the following, upon a marble slab, relates to her

the pedigree of Jane Maxwell (1749-1812), married (1767) to Alexander, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743-1827), son of Cosimo George,

was on Army Lists for 1757 and 1758, but not later [following the siege of
Louisbourg] in the renumbered 78<sup>th</sup> Regt., or Fraser’s Highlanders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He probably died after 10th August 1758 when Colonel Simon
Fraser “was reading Struy a lecture” at Louisbourg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

altogether as relations but my particular regard for their own worth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

to the 4000 merks owed to Hugh Fraser younger, father of the defunct [Thomas

be a legitimate debt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think the

guilty of treason and other crimes against the State, “ravishing persons of
distinguished ranks,” to wit, the Dowager Lady Lovat, and sentenced to death
and forfeiture in absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
to him that Simon Fraser, before he left for France in 1702, granted the bond
for 4000 merks, and which continued an irritating cause of dispute and
litigation between the two families for many years afterwards - until after Lord
Simon’s execution in 1747.<o:p>

granting bonds of security to certain individuals on condition that they remain
loyal to Simon’s personal interests in his absence in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In effect, he granted them bonds, obliging himself personally, along with
his brother John, then his apparent heir, as cautioner, to pay them a certain
sum of money named in each case, with the shrewd proviso, that the bond was
“to stand in force upon condition the said (naming the person) stand faithful

appears that Struy, after Simon succeeded to the estates, insisted upon the
payment of the amount of his bond, but Simon strenuously resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted having signed the bonds, but pleaded that he was at the time
under an insane and criminal hallucination, tempting him to commit treason
against his lawful sovereign and to support the cause of the Pretender, urging
at the same time that it was impossible that a set of bonds all granted on the
same day, and to the same class of persons, could have had any other object than
a treasonable combination; and as it was the policy of the law not to enforce
obligations for the commission of crime so he should not be compelled to fulfill
any of these contracts, all entered into by him when he “was in the gall of
inequity.” <o:p>
