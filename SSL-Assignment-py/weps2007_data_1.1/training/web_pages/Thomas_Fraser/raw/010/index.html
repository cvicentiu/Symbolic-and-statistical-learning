<p>In this census, Jane Fraser is listed as "Blind or Deaf and Dumb". It
is highly likely that Jane was deaf, and that this is the explanation why
her maiden surname is always different every time it is listed. A real

It took a long time to discover the origin of Thomas's middle name, "Meiklehose".
His mother's maiden name was Hose and her grandmother's maiden name was
Meikle. His mother's full name was probably Jane Meikle Hose, and this
is where Thomas's rather strange middle name came from. On Thomas's birth
certificate his mother's name is actually given as Jane Meiklehose.
<p>Tall, handsome and fair haired. Later in life he had a big white moustache
and beard.
<p>Did the fancy plaster cornice work you can see a lot in Glasgow houses.
<p>Went out to Ontario, Canada in 1923 to join his son James and look for
employment, but returned to Scotland.
<p>Very fond of a drink. Had to hand over his pay packet to Sarah, so on
pay day used to seal a florin up in the plaster of the house he was working
on, and then dig it out later at an appropriate time.
<p>Said of his wife, "When I married ye, Sarah, I lo'ed ye so much I could
have eaten ye. And I wisht tae God I hud!"
<p>Good singer. Always singing and reciting poetry.
<p>Clay pipe smoker. (Probable cause of his mouth cancer)
<p>Knew the stars and constellations.
<p>Some connection with the Inverness area?
