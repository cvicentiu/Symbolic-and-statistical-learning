      down a story concerning my ancestors, at what date little is known, about <br>
      our Syme family Owning and running a Tea plantation in Ceylon. we are told <br>
      of a rivalry with another Tea growing family, liptons. the story goes that <br>
      a mysterious fire burnt down the house of the plantation, along with deeds, <br>
      shortly following the lipton family took control ownership. My family to <br>
      this day boycott the products of this family and hiss at the name. Such a <br>

      when Alexander Frasier arrived from Inverness, Scotland in the 1600's. My <br>
      great Grandfather Simon Frasier was born in White County Tenn. I have <br>
      always been interested in when the Frasier's added the i to the spelling of <br>
      Frasier. After extensive review of the spelling of Frasier, I found that <br>
      the i was added in approx. 1400 BC of Malcom Frasier of Inverness, <br>
      Scotland. Was the i added to distinquish seperation of family clan's? Also, <br>
      there are a few Frasiers in Normany (France) from the 1700's. Added: November 20, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fraser-clan.org/gbook.php?a=delete&amp;num=32"><img height="14" alt="Delete this entry" src="http://www.fraser-clan.org/images/delete.gif" width="16"></a></td>

  Message: Hi,<br>
  I and several other researchers in the USA have formed the conclusion that the Frizzell family of the US and Canada are descendants of 2 brothers, James and William, who were sent to the America's after their defeat by Cromwells forces at the battle of Worcester in 1651 or the battle of Dunbar in 1650. We further believe that these 2 brothers are the sons of the 2nd Lord Fraser of Muchalls. Records indicate that James was believed to have died in the early 1650's. Not so, but in that time era and with all the deaths in those 2 battles, how could they know. It states that they believe he died-not that they know he died.<br>
  Several researchers have independantly reached the same conclusion and welcome any comments, pro or con to our research... </p>

So to all Cowies out there we all may be related. I did not until recently know which clan the Cowie name came from so would be interested in any information, that can be given. To Heather Cowie in New Zealand, Do you know Barb Bailey in Grangemouth? My Grandmother on my mums side her maiden name was Gillson, so some of the Gillsons live in New Zealand. John Cowie was my mothers father, he had a brother Robert Cowie. I wonder if we can connect all of our families up. Small world isn't it. Best wishes to all Mary Axtell. </p>

  Message: This is a great site. We are Fraziers on my mothers side. My grandfather was William Wallace Frazier and his father was James C. Frazier. He (James) was a private in the 19th Texas Cavalry during the late unpleasantness. James had two brothers who served in different regiments but they were brigaded together. Parsons Dragoons.GreatGrandfather James was born on the 12th of September 1835 in Louisiana and the family moved to Texas when it was still a part of Mexico. I retired from the U.S. Navy and was employed as a field Engineer on Submarines went all over the world troubleshooting the boats but my favorite call was always Holy Loch. In periods of waiting I went to Inverness and actually drove to Beauly Castle and took a picture of a thistle on the grounds. I didn't want to be a bother as I was unannounced but I picked up a pebble from the Beauly river.<br>
  Keep well<br>

I've gotten back to 1753 for my 4th great granddad, Micajah who served in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Trying to trace his wife, Susannah Hamilton. Possibly she's related to Alexander Hamilton, 1st Secy of State. Both families originated in Scotland. There's also a wonderful book series on the Clan Fraser called the &quot;Outlander&quot; series by Diana Gabaldon. There's allot of research references in her books.

  Message: Greetings from Ottawa, Canada. <br>
  I think I'm one of the lucky ones who can claim Fraser ancestry from both my mother's and my father's line.<br>
  On my father's side, my third great grandfather James Frazer, with his three brothers William, Robert and George emigrated to NY from Tyrone County, Northern Ireland, in 1808. James later moved to Halton County, Ontario west of Toronto where he homesteaded, married and had eleven children. Over the years, the spelling gradually changed to Fraser. I have read that the Ulster Scots more often than not used the &quot;Z&quot; spelling. I have no idea how long they were in Ulster nor where they came from in Scotland. The only clue I have is from a reference book which descibed James as having a &quot;broad Scotch accent&quot;, so perhaps he wasn't there long.<br>
  On my mother's side, my third great grandfather, Alexander Fraser was born April 12, 1813, in Ross Shire, and was christened in the church of Loggie. He emigrated sometime before 1838 and settled in Oxford County in SW Ontario.<br>
  Any connections, please feel free to send me a line.<br>

  I am, however, definitely descended from an Alexander Fraser, through his daughter Eliza Louisa Fraser/Frazer (born 1844, NSW), who is my GG grandmother. But it seems my Alexander Fraser is probably from Laggan/Alvie in Scotland.<br>

Alexander Fraser born 1749 in Kirkhill and minister on Isle of Mull. His son Donald Alan Fraser born 1793 married Katherine Isabella MacLean and came to Fraser &amp; MacLennans Mountain, Nova Scotia in 1817. Two of their ten sons, Alexander and Alan, went to Australia, two to the US, Charles and Henry and the remainder of the sons and one daughter ended up in Newfoundland.

In 1968 a group of 37 American Frasers/Fraziers/Simons/Simpsons etc. traveled to Scotland and were &quot;hosted&quot; by the previous Lord Lovat in Beauly. My sister Kathy and I made an impression there by swimming across a loch to an island where we were all having a picnic; we were too impatient to take our turns waiting for the rowboat! Ever since our group's visit there has been a great friendship between the Scottish and the California Frasers, with many visits back and forth. My mother, Barbara G. Frazier, recently attented a California clan meeting at which the youngest Lord Lovat was present. I now live in Oregon, so my involvement with the clan is attenuated, but my mother is an active participant. In the California clan, all interested parties of Fraser lineage are welcome to join.

  Message: I'm interested in tracing my family roots in Scotland. My grandfather, Hugh Fraser, came to the United States when he was 6-8 years old. He was born near Conaan Bridge. I do know of one relative, Iona or Eona Fraser living in Inverness. I believe she is now retired from school teaching. If someone could point me in the right direction to start, I would be very appreciative.</p>

I have cousins in Scotland, the MacDougals, and I am very involved and interested in my scottish history. I live in the US and have never been to Scotland, I would love to I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Ever since I was young my father, Stuart, praised the Scottish and would tell me interesting facts and how they were great, creating some of the worlds greatest inventions, well it rubbed off on me. I loved to hear stories about ancestors such as Lord Lovat, and how he was the last man killed in the London Tower. I went to upstate New York to have kilts made for my brothers 13th birthday party and was fascinated by the clans and clan tartans, coming back with only more questions. Wow, I've been typing a long time, better get back to work. Well, email me if your a Fraser and want to talk. <br>

  Message: Great Site! My great-grandfather, George Fred Fraser, first arrived in the United States about 1882 and lived in Roanoke, Virginia before eventually finding his way to Chicago, Illinois. He was with two of his brothers and a son when he arrived in Roanoke. I believe that the brothers stayed in Roanoke. Prior to his immigration to the U.S. he lived in Australia and raised a family there. I am descended from the 2nd family that he started after arriving in Chicago. Going further back, he served in the British military and fought in the Crimean War. It's my understanding that his military service took him to Australia. I would love to connect with my long lost distant cousins.<br>

The Clan must play a significant role in my family's history, as my father, before his death in 1994, often made reference to the family's roots being in Scotland. What research i've done to date suggests that our brach of the family is more closely associated with the Fraser of Lovat. It is nice to know you belong. I would welcome any information that would help my research into the family genealogical line. </p>

  Message: There would seem to be many James Frasers up to date, including the (fictional)one in the well-known books by Diana Gabaldon. My maternal grandfather was James William Fraser, 1874-1956, born in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. His great-grandfather was William Fraser from Inverness-shire, who arrived in Pictou County in 1801 with his wife and his son John. They returned to Scotland, where John married and returned to Nova Scotia to cut timber and farm. Their son John, Jr., was my great-grandfather. I don't know where the earlier generations lived, other than in Inverness-shire. As it happened, my grandfather married a young emigrant Scotswoman with the wonderful name of Annie Laurie MacGillivray. There are Mathesons, Camerons, Roys, Oldings, Maxwells, and MacKenzies all in the family line. </p>

  Message: According to the date on my gg-grandfather Evan Fraser's tombstone in Ohio (USA), he was born in 1784. In 1840, on his application for U.S. Citizenship, he stated he had been in this country on or before 1812. The IGI (LDS) has an extracted birth/christening record for an Evan Fraser born 2 April 1784 in Kiltarlity, Inverness, Scotland to parents Alexander and Isabel Fraser. I don't know when Evan emigrated to the U.S. He was married in 1820/21 in Pennsylvania, had a son there, and moved to Columbiana County, Ohio where the rest of his children were born. Information about Evan and his parentage will be much appreciated. </p>

  It is nice to have some reseach about Frasers clan. I am interested of Scottish history and clans. I have read Diana Gabaldons books, and there are man called James Fraser (Jamie) in main character. It would be nice to know, is he real person or not? He lived 18. century (1700-?).<br>
  Wondeful sites! Thank you and greetings here from Finland.<br>
