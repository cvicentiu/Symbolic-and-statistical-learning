<P><B>The Buie Frasers of McLennans Mountain, Pictou County </B>by
Kenneth Fraser (August 2004)</P>

<P>Grandpa Fraser always made a point of telling us that we were
related to the &quot;Buie Frasers&quot; from McLennans Mountain.
Apparently our nickname came from the Gaelic custom of distinguishing
people by personal characteristics like size or hair colour, or
even occupation. The nickname &quot;Buie&quot; comes from the
Gaelic word &quot;buidhe&quot; meaning yellow, in this case probably
referring to the hair colour of our ancestor who settled on the
mountain. Another Fraser family on the mountain had the nickname
&quot;Bann&quot; because they were fair-haired.</P>

<P>Grandpa told me that his grandfather, John Fraser (1811-1901),
and his grandmother, Nancy Gray, lived in the community of Brookville
on McLennans Mountain, and that he used to hear his grandparents
speaking the Gaelic language when he visited them. He also told
me a few stories about his father, Alexander Fraser (1844-1918),
who left the mountain as a young man to seek his fortune in the
gold fields of California. When he returned to Pictou County around
1879 he bought a farm on the road between Greenhill and Durham
that included a house built from quarried sandstone, the &quot;Fraser
Stonehouse&quot; where my grandfather and my father were born.</P>

<P>Fascinated by these stories that my grandfather had told me,
I naturally wished to know more about my ancestors. As a teenager
I started my search for information using the books about local
history that we had at home, but it wasn't until years later that
I went to the library in New Glasgow (and after that the resource
room of the Pictou County Roots Society) to research my genealogy
in a more systematic way. The following account tells about some
of the information that I have found so far.</P>

<P>The Buie Frasers emigrated from Scotland to Pictou County in
1801 and settled on the forested upland area southeast of present-day
New Glasgow which is designated as &quot;McLellans Mountain&quot;
in the<I> Nova Scotia Atlas </I>(2001)<I>.</I> The stream flowing
down from the mountain into the East River is likewise named &quot;McLellans
Brook&quot;, whereas &quot;McLennans Mountain&quot; is the name
of a particular community on the mountain. The MacLellans Mountain
Cemetery across the road from St. John's Presbyterian Church is
located at a place named Kirkmount. And, the community of Brookville
(where my great-grandfather was born) is about five kilometres
south of the summit of McLellans Mountain near the source of McLellans
Brook.</P>

<P>Today on McLellans Mountain there are many vacant homesteads
where families once made a living by farming and lumbering. The
1901 Census lists 480 people in the McLellans Mountain district;
and, it is worthy of mention that 96 of these people identified
the Gaelic language as their mother tongue.</P>

<P>My first written source of information about the &quot;Buie
Frasers&quot; was in <I>A History of the County of Pictou</I>
by the Rev. George Patterson. In a footnote, referring to the
immigrants transported to Pictou County by George Dunoon in 1801,
John Fraser (Buie) is listed as one of the first settlers on McLennans
Mountain:</P>

<P>&quot;* List of first settlers on McLennan's Mountain: -- Don.
McDonald (tailor), Donald McDonald, James Fraser, ____ Grant,
William McLean, Finlay McDonald (piper), Donald Fraser, Finlay
McDonald (carpenter), James Cameron, Thomas Cameron, John Fraser
(Buie), Alexander Cameron, Finlay McIntosh, Alexander Fraser (weaver),
James Fraser (Bann), Hugh Cameron, Alexander McDonald, John Fraser,
Peter Stewart, James Fraser, John McRae, Donald McPherson, Angus
Fraser (Deacon).&quot; (page 229)</P>

<P>After finding this information about John Fraser (Buie) who
settled on McLennans Mountain, I assumed that he was one of my
ancestors because of his nickname and, before visiting the MacLellans
Mountain Cemetery at Kirkmount, I thought that John Fraser (Buie)
might have been my grandfather's grandfather who had lived in
Brookville. However, when I found the gravestone for my grandfather's
grandfather, John Fraser (1811-1901), I realized from the dates
that he couldn't have been the John Fraser (Buie) who settled
on MacLennans Mountain in 1801.</P>

<P>During the same visit to the MacLellans Mountain Cemetery,
I saw a gravestone erected in memory of another one of the Buie
Frasers with the following inscription:</P>

<P><CENTER>IN MEMORY<BR>
of<BR>
THOMAS FRASER, BUIE<BR>
Born at Kiltarlity Scotland <BR>
Died July 18th 1876 <BR>
Aged 98 years<BR>
ALSO <BR>
Catherine McBain <BR>
Spouse of Tho's Fraser <BR>
Died April 11th 1880 <BR>
Aged 93 years</CENTER></P>

<P>However, at the time, I didn't know how I might be related
to Thomas Fraser (Buie) since Grandpa Fraser hadn't mentioned
anyone by that name.</P>

<P>Fortunately, a few years later, I met Margaret Adair who was
living in Stellarton, though she was born at McLennans Mountain
and maintained ties with her community of birth even after she
moved to town. She was a Buie Fraser of the same generation as
my grandfather; in genealogical terminology, they were second
cousins descended from the same great-grandfather, Thomas Fraser
(Buie). Mrs. Adair told me that her grandfather, Thomas Fraser
(1816-1911), and my grandfather's grandfather, John Fraser (1811-1901)
of Brookville, were both sons of Thomas Fraser (Buie) and Catherine
MacBain.</P>

<P>At this point in my research, I now had some clues to help
me trace my genealogy back to the ancestors who had emigrated
from Scotland; namely, I knew that I was descended from Thomas
Fraser (Buie) who emigrated from Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire,
Scotland. And, from the footnote in <I>A History of the</I> <I>County
of Pictou</I> by the Rev. George Patterson, I knew that John Fraser
(Buie) was one of the first to settle at McLennans Mountain and
that he most likely emigrated from Scotland on one of the ships
chartered by Dunoon in 1801, either the <I>Dove</I> or the <I>Sarah</I>.
And, indeed, I found that a John Fraser from Kiltarlity (along
with his wife Christian) was listed as a passenger on the ship
<I>Sarah</I>. Unfortunately, I didn't find a passenger in either
list by the name of Thomas Fraser. Now I needed information to
establish the familial connection between John Fraser (Buie) and
Thomas Fraser (Buie).</P>

<P>Fortunately, the connection between John Fraser (Buie) and
Thomas Fraser (Buie) had already been made; namely, in the obituary
of Mary MacDonald, the sister of John Fraser (1811-1901) that
was published in <I>The Eastern Chronicle</I> on November 17,
1903:</P>

<P>&quot;Mrs. James Macdonald, of Coalburn, died on last Thursday
evening, at the good round age of eighty-five years. Her maiden
name was Mary Fraser. She was a daughter of Thomas Fraser, who
was a son of John Fraser (Buie) one of a body of emigrants brought
out from Scotland, in 1801 in one of the vessels owned by Hugh
Denoon [<I>or</I> Dunoon]. Three Frasers settled at that time
on adjacent grants of land on McLennan's Mountain, two of whom
came from Lord Lovatt's country, in one of Denoon's vessels, viz.
John Fraser already mentioned and Jas. Fraser (Bann). The third
was Simon Fraser, deacon, Thomas' son. Mrs. Macdonald, whose decease
we are recording, was a granddaughter of the John Fraser, Buie,
mentioned above.&quot;</P>

<P>However, in spite of the definitive statement made above about
the relationship between John Fraser (Buie) and Thomas Fraser
(Buie), I believe that it is necessary to find some supporting
evidence for the relationship, and indeed any other information
that there might be about the first generation of the Buie Frasers
in Pictou County. In particular, I would like to know more about
the children of John Fraser (Buie) other than Thomas Fraser (Buie).</P>

<P>In August 1976 Mrs. Adair showed me, on the map of McLellans
Mountain in the <I>Atlas of Pictou County</I> (1879), the homestead
where her grandfather, Thomas Fraser (1816-1911), and her great-grandfather,
Thomas Fraser (Buie), had lived. The <I>Crown Landgrant Index
Sheet</I> for this part of Pictou County indicates that the property
identified by Mrs. Adair was granted by the Crown to a John Fraser
in 1828. Further research at the Registry of Deeds in Pictou revealed
that in 1839 a John Fraser transferred his title to part of this
homestead to a Thomas Fraser; and, fortuitously, there is another
important piece of information in this document; namely, the &quot;relinquishment
of dower rights&quot; by Christian Fraser, the wife of John Fraser.
So, even though my conclusion is based on circumstantial evidence,
it appears that John and Christian Fraser could be the parents
of Thomas Fraser (Buie).</P>

<P>Another son of Thomas Fraser (Buie), Donald Fraser (1828-1867),
lived at McLennans Mountain on the same 200 acre lot of land that
was granted by the Crown to a John Fraser in 1819. Once again
(based on circumstantial evidence, not all described here) I am
tempted to conclude that this is the same John Fraser who was
granted land in 1828, and that both grantees are John Fraser (Buie).
Though not providing any substantive link to this particular land
grant, there was a petition for land made by a John Fraser of
McLellans Mountain in 1815 in which it states that &quot;Your
Excellency's Petitioner [i.e. John Fraser] was born in Scotland
in the County of Inverness, emigrated to this Province in the
year 1801, has resided in the Province ever since, has a wife
and four children all in life and in the Province, has settled
on 200 acres on McLellans Mountain and made considerable improvements
on the same ...&quot;. Once again just enough information to encourage
speculation, but not sufficient to justify drawing any conclusions.</P>

<P>My search for information pertaining to John Fraser (Buie)
and his family will continue so that I can complete the story
about the Buie Frasers. While I have found much of my information
through independent research, I have to acknowledge the assistance
given to me by others who are interested in my project. Since
joining the Pictou County Roots Society I have received significant
help from their research staff, in particular from Marlene Chisholm
with whom I share a common ancestor; namely, John McBain whose
daughter, Catherine McBain, was the wife of Thomas Fraser (Buie).
Keeping true to the spirit of this cooperation, I will make every
effort to share my information; you may contact me at the following
