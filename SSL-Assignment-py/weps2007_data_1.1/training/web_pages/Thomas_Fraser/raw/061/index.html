<p>Article in the Hamilton Advertiser of 1891.<p><i>FATAL ACCIDENT - On Monday
morning a melancholy accident, which afterwards proved fatal, happened to Mr.
Andrew Fraser, master slater, 21 Holmes Street, at the Parish Halls.&nbsp; He
was engaged in the repair of the roof, and was standing on the top step of a 30
feet ladder when it gave way and he fell heavily to the ground.&nbsp; Previous
to being taken home, he was carried into the house of Mr. Love, the janitor of
the halls, and Dr. Lennox, who was called, found that his left arm was fractured
near the elbow and that he had sustained other severe injuries.&nbsp; Being
sixty-eight years of age, the shock to his system was very great, and he died
early the following morning.&nbsp; Deceased was an old townsman, hard-working,
and industrious.&nbsp; He is survived by a widow and family.</i>
