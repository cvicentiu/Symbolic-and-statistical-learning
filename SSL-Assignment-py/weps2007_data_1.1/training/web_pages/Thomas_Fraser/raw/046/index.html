Spring a young man's fancy often turns to golf.&nbsp; A visiting Scottish sailor
took a few swings with his clubs on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec in 1854, and
41 years later four prominent members of the Toronto Golf Club missed the first
Canadian Amateur Championship played at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club because they
were in court defending themselves against criminal charges for having played a
game on a Sunday in contravention of the Lord's Day Act.&nbsp; Their conviction
was overturned, on appeal, on the grounds that &quot;golf is not a game of ball
similar to those prescribed by law; it is not a noisy game, like football or
baseball.&quot;<br>
<br>
His obituary in the Montreal Star, 14 Aug 1958, notes: &quot;Happy&quot; as he
was affectionately known by his numerous friends reached the pinnacle of his
golfing career in 1922 at Hamilton when he won the Canadian amateur golf title
with a one-up victory over Norman Scott, of the Royal Montreal Golf Club in a
37-hole match. In 1925, playing over his home course, Kanawaki Golf Club, he won
the Quebec amateur title.<br>

The Quebec Gazette, 29 Feb. 1840, reported: At Campbell Town, North Britain,
aged 85, Mr. John Fraser, the father of Mr. Donald Fraser, merchant of this
city.&nbsp; Such news often took time to travel from Scotland to Canada, as
evidenced by the following monumental inscription:&nbsp;<br>
Old Churchyard, Petty, Inverness-shire MI #145 - {Slab}&nbsp; In memory of John
Fraser, late of Campbelltown, who was born on the 20th day of September in the
year of our Lord 1753 and departed this life on the first day of Septr. 1838,
aged 85 years; and of Isabel Clark, his first wife, the only child of John Clark
of Dores by his first wife, who departed this life on the [blank] day of March
1796, aged 39 years.&nbsp; This stone has been raised by their son Donald
Fraser, merchant of the City of Quebec, North America 1845.<br>

Archibald Fraser, who came from Edinburgh ca 1819 at the request of the Reverend
(later Bishop) Alexander Macdonell (1762-1840) to build St Raphael’s church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
