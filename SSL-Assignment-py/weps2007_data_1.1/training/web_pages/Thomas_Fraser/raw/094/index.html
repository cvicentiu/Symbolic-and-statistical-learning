<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Notes for Angus (Spouse 1)</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">    Angus was born July 7, 1777 at Drummond Plantation in the Parish of Boleskine, second son of John Fraser and Catherine McDonald. He was baptized by the Rev. Patrick Grant at the newly erected Kirk at Drumtemple (Gaelic: &quot;druim teampuill&quot; - ridge of the temple). Angus, his brother John, and his six sisters were all born in Boleskine Parish; and the three that did not occur at Drummond Plantation were due to &quot;an sealach&quot; or the transitory system of summer-pasturing the black cattle on the western slopes of &quot;An Monadh Liath&quot; (The Grey Mountain)<BR>
<BR>
     Angus' father John (d. June 29, 1785) and his paternal grandfather William (d. 1774) were tenants at Drummond on the lands of Fraser of Knockie - a cadet-family of the House of Lovat, located at the south-end of Stratherrick on east-side of Loch Ness (between present day Fort Augustus and the Village of Foyers).<BR>
<BR>
    Angus Fraser had six years military service with the First Grant or Strathspey Regiment of Fencibles, raised at Forres, Nairnshire by Sir James Grant of Grantin in 1793. The Grants were deployed as an anti-invasion unit in the south of Scotland, and after six years were reduced at Stirling in April 1799. The description of Angus from his discharge papers:  &quot;Angus Fraser - Private Soldier - Age 33 - Height 5 feet 5 inches - fair complexion- brown hair - born, Bullesgen.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    Angus was granted 360 acres on sixth division of lands at South MacLennan Mountain, NS in October, 1802.  He is listed by Patterson's history of Pictou County as one of the early settlers at McLellan's Mountain. <SUP><A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jac/Fraser/WC_SRC.HTM#C32">32</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
