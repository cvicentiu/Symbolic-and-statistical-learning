		<B>...a family of another name, usually native to the Fraser country,
		would get a large bag (a Boll) of grain when they took the name
		of Fraser, living in the Fraser Country, adopting the concerns
		of the Clan as their own. Those Frasers were called <I>Boll O' Meal Frasers. </I>Today, any one named Fraser, or any Sept of Fraser who would come
		to know the concerns of their Gaelic Forebears, the concerns of
		their clansmen and support preservation of the awareness of that
		way of life would be quite fitting, from a Clan perspective.</B><P>
		<B></B>
		<HR SIZE="2">
		<P>
		<B><FONT SIZE="5">Simon the Fox's...</FONT> </B><P>
		<B>...father, Thomas Fraser of Beaufort, had inherited the estates
		of Lovat from his grand-nephew, Hugh Fraser, 9th Lord Lovat, because
		Hugh had four daughters but no male heir. Thomas Fraser was the
		fourth and only surviving son of Hugh Fraser, 7th Lord Lovat,
		so the estates went to him instead of Hugh Fraser, 9th Lord Lovat's
		eldest Daughter Amelia. Thomas' son Simon who was to become 11th
		Lord Lovat, had planned to marry the Lovat Heiress, Amelia. When
		his plan failed he retaliated. He besieged Castle Dounie with
		his clansmen taking possession of the lands. Some say he married
		Amelia's mother, the dowager Lady Lovat, others say he married
		Amelia, the heiress.</B><P>
		<B>He was as true a &quot;MacShimidh&quot; as ever there had been. His Clansmen
		would regularly share his table for meals and if he came upon
		one of his Clan in passing he could tell the person how their
		blood lines tied and from whom. He placed nothing between himself
		and his kin and his ultimate concern was their welfare. He spoke
		Gaelic, English and French, maintaining relations with the Marquis
		De Frezeliere, in France considering him a blood relative, understanding
		their shared Norman roots. He befuddled the English numerous times,
		for they were not at all equipped to handle the character of the
		Highland terrain, or the character of it's warriors.</B><P>

		<FONT SIZE="5">You Will Remember That Queen Anne</FONT> </B><P>
		<B>died in 1714 and the protestant George of Hanover was proclaimed
		King. The North was restive and an armed body of Highlanders had
		to be dispersed at Inverlochy near Fort William.<BR>
		<BR>
		When King William died and Ann received the throne, the Chief
		of the Frasers, Simon. went to France. He had been running a constant
		battle with some Murrays of Athol. With his sturdy and trusted
		Frasers at his side, he had frustrated and defeated the Murrays
		at every turn. He captured the infamous General Dolyell, sent
		to humiliate and put down the Clan.<BR>
		<BR>
		Lovat had, through the Campbells' Duke of Argyll, managed a pardon
		from King William for the crime of treason. There remained in
		Scotland the charge of rape. The charge was never proven, but
		it remained a threat, and when Argyll received and passed on to
		the Fraser chief the information that the trial was to be &quot;rigged&quot;,
		Simon had no alternative but to leave the Highlands.<BR>
		<BR>
		He went to France where he reported into the exiled James Stewart
		VII of Scotland and England. Seeing their chance the Athol Murrays
		put the granddaughter of the Duke of Athol into possession of
		the lands of Lovat.<BR>
		<BR>
		The Fraser Chiefship and the title had always been considered
		one which could only devolve upon a man. Lovat was a 'male fief'.
		A concession to this principle was the promise of the Clan that
		Amelia Fraser would marry only a Fraser.<BR>
		<BR>
		So, who was to be her husband and the leader of the great family?
		A MacKenzie, who called himself MacKenzie of Fraserdale in an
		effort to meet the promise of the Murrays.<BR>
		<BR>
		MacKenzie's father was Lord Prestonhall, a corrupt judge of the
		court at session. This older MacKenzie contrived, in Lovat's absence
		in France, to get hold of the estate by buying a debt of eighty-three
		pounds and levying the judgment against all of the Fraser country.<BR>
		<BR>
		To the Athol Murrays were added the MacKenzies of Seaforth, all
		now enemies of the Clan, bent upon its destruction. To support
		an ally of these Clans was to support the enemies of the Frasers.
		Perhaps here is a clue to the support the Frasers ultimately gave
		to George I of Hanover against the Stewart king, James VII. This
		and the imprisonment of their Chief by Stewart and the King's
		disregard of the threat of James Fraser of Castle Leathers.</B><P>

		THE VIEWS OF LORD LOVAT<BR>
		OF THE '45 ON THREATS TO HIS CLAN<BR>
		And THE &quot;ACT OF UNION&quot;<BR>
		</B><P>
		<B>&quot;If it be God's will that for the punishment of my great and many
		sins, and the sins of my kindred, I should now depart this life
		before I put these just and good resolutions in execution, yet
		I hope that God in his mercy will inspire you and all honest Frasers,
		to stand by and be faithful to my cousin Inverallochy, and the
		other heirs male of my family, and to venture your lives and fortunes
		to put him or my nearest heirs male, named in my testament, written
		by John Jacks, in the full possession of the estate and honours
		of my forefathers, which is the only way to preserve you from
		the wicked designs of the family of Tarbat and Glengarry, joined
		to the family of Athol, and you may depend upon it, and you and
		your posterity will see to it and find it, that if you do not
		keep steadfast to your Chief, I mean the heir male of my family;
		but weakly or falsely for little private interest and views, abandon
		your duty to your name and suffer a pretended heiress and her
		Mackenzie children to possess your country and the true right
		of the heirs male,</B><P>
		<B>They will certainly, in less than an age, chase you all by slight
		and might, as well gentlemen as commons, out of your native country,
		which will be possessed by the Mackenzies and the Macdonalds;
		and you will be like the miserable and unnatural Jews, scattered
		and vagabonds throughout the unhappy Kingdom of Scotland, and
		the poor wives and children that remain of the name, without a
		hear or protection, when they are told the traditions of their
		family, will be cursing from their hearts the persons and memory
		of those unnatural, cowardly, knavish men, who sold and abandoned
		their Chief, their name, their birthright, and their country for
		a false and foolish present gain, even as the most of Scots people
		curse this day those who sold them and their country to the English
		by the fatal union which I hope will not last long.<BR>
		<BR>
		&quot;I make my earnest and dying prayers to God Almighty, that he
		may in his mercy, through the merits of Christ Jesus, save you
		and all my poor people, whom always I found honest and zealous
		to me and their duty, from that blindness of heart that will inevitably
		bring those ruins and disgraces upon you and your posterity; and
		I pray the Almighty and merciful God, who has often miraculously
		saved my family and name from utter ruin, may give you the spirit
		of courage and zeal and of fidelity that you owe to your chief,
		to your name, to yourselves, to your children, and to your country;
		and may the most merciful and adorable Trinity, Father, Son, and
		Holy Spirit, three persons, one God, save all your souls, eternally,
		through the blood of Christ Jesus, our blessed Lord Savior, to
		whom I heartily recommend you.<BR>
		<BR>
		&quot;I desire that this letter may be kept in a box, at Beaufort or
		Moniack, and read once a year by the heir male, or a principal
		gentleman of the name, to all honest Frasers that will continue
		faithful to the duty I have enjoined in this above-written letter,
		to whom, with you and all honest Frasers and my other friends,
		I leave my tender and affectionate blessing and bid my kind and
		last farewell.&quot;<BR>
		<BR>
		LOVAT<BR>
		<BR>
		London, the 5th of April, 1718.<BR>
		<BR>
		&quot;Not being able to write myself, I did dictate the above letter
		to the little French boy that's my servant. It contains the most
		sincere sentiments of my heart, and if it touch my kindred in
		reading of it as it did me while I dictated it, I am sure it will
		have a good effect, which are my earnest prayers to God.&quot;*<BR>

		<FONT SIZE="5">Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat...</FONT> </B><P>
		<B>...is one of the great villains of history, and probably responsible
		for most of the bad in his Clan's reputation. Treacherous, venal,
		violent, and shameless, he lied, plotted, stole, abducted, aledgedly
		raped and deceived through 80 outrageous years in which he was
		jailed, escaped, disguised, outlawed and endlessly reviled. Name
		the evil, Simon had done it; think of a scoundrel, he was worse.
		Yet, he is a hard man to dislike. When viewed from the context
		and duties understood to be inherent to the Fraser Clan Chief,
		he acted in what he felt the best interest of his kindred. If
		the end result was to be the good of the Clan, he was the 'Prince'
		Machiavelli would have adored.<BR>
		<BR>
		The paradox is explained in Hogarth's famous portrait. The wicked
		old ruffian sits there, black badness written in every line of
		him, weighing up the world and waiting his chance. But, at least
		it is not a glum face; there is a mischievous, alert quality about
		the figure and about the unmistakable Fraser eyes. Hogarth caught
		the spirit of his subject, and it is his spirit that people remember.<BR>
		<BR>
		If Simon Fraser had died at any time in his first 79 years, he
		would be memorable as an unspeakable rascal and no more. But he
		was spared to make his exit on Tower Green with a happy bravery
		that has something heroic about it; no one ever played to the
		gallery so well. He wriggled and twisted to the end of his trial
		in the House of Lords, and went to his death with a running fire
		of good humour.<BR>
		<BR>
		&quot;you'll get that nasty head of yours chopped off, you ugly old
		Scotch dog,&quot;<BR>
		cried an old woman in the London streets.<BR>
		Back came the answer: &quot;I believe I shall, you ugly old English
		bitch.&quot;<BR>
		When a stand collapsed just before his execution, killing several
		spectators, he observed memorably: </B><P>
		<B>&quot;The more mischief, the better sport.&quot;</B><P>
		<B>And, on the scaffold itself he was merry to the last, testing
		the axe's edge, telling his friends to cheer up since he, after
		all, was cheerful, joking with the executioner about how he would
		be angry if the man didn't make a neat job of it, and finally
		laying his head on the block without a tremor. As his biographer
		says, if he lived like a fox, he died like a lion.<BR>
		<BR>
		After Culloden, where Simon did not fight, he was sentenced to
		be hanged, drawn and quartered on the Tower Hill, London. Since
		he was of the peerage they decided only to chop his head off.
		He was the last person in history beheaded on Tower Hill. It was
		April 9, 1747, exactly one week short of a year after the Battle
		of Culloden, the last Jacobite rebellion. The story of Simon the
		Fox is every bit as compelling as that of William &quot;Braveheart&quot;
		Wallace, if not more, as it is a true Highland story. Ironically,
		those of the throne that put him to death sat there because of
		his the Clan Fraser's part in the rising of 1715.</B><P>
