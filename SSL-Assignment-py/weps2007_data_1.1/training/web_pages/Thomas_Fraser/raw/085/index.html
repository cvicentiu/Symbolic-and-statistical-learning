In the Register of the Great Seal (1424-1513), there is confimation of transfer of the lands of Balneaves in the barony of Kinnell in Forfar, to David Liel, son and heir of William Liel of Balneaves. Later, in October 1501, the Lands of Balneaves were transferred from Thomas Fraser, Laird of Lovat to George Lyon, Laird of Glammis (ref <A HREF="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/dougfraser/refs.htm#lb4">lb4</A>).
