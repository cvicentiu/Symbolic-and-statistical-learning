	 My wife's favorite type of boardgame

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Wow, when I said my family gaming was starting to work, I wasn't kidding! Last night my wife & I played our new copy of On The Underground.<br /><br />Not only that, but this was a game she requested, or at least she agreed that it sounded interesting after I described it to her the week before. That was after I'd played it for the first time at my local game group, and thought the mechanics and--especially--London theme would be a hit since we'd just made plans to take the family to London in April. I was confident enough that I ordered a copy for myself immediately. Most of that story is a fairly typical experience for me: think a game might be a good fit for Candy &amp; I to play together, then order it. And though it does happen, it doesn't always work out that she likes it. (Paris Paris is an example of one that struck out.)<br /><br />Yesterday she mentioned during the middle of the day that she might like to try On The Underground in the evening. We played it, she beat me handily without any handicapping or holding back (I don't do that), and she enjoyed the game. It took a bit over an hour, which was a longer than the games we usually play together (e.g. Thurn & Taxis), but she still liked it.<br /><br />Not only <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>, but in talking about it afterward she observed that she liked "these sort" of games, in general. I asked, and we figured out that meant connection games like T&T, OTU, and Ticket To Ride. Holy cow! My wife has a favorite type of boardgame!<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /><br />P.S. Any tips on maximizing the sale of Deluxe/Limited edition of the Lord of the Rings? This is the same cooperative boardgame by Knizia, only published by Sophisticated Games, and comes with a metal ring, metal figures, and a numbered edition print. The game itself is a numbered edition, too, as I recall. I don't have any idea how to price the game for sale through the BGG marketplace, and there aren't even any recent games sold on ebay. Not this edition, anyway, just the more common one.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

These retrospectives are a little harder to do without stats . . . but then what would stats tell me, anyway? For me, the real point is to talk about games that have become new favorites, especially ones I think will be keepers for the long haul. To be honest, I'm not sure how many of even the "hits" will keep getting played over the next five years, but I think Thurn & Taxis is a safe bet.<br /><br />As for my look forward, I wonder my desire to <span style="font-style: italic;">physically</span> produce a game of some kind--either my own prototype or an existing game component upgrade--makes sense to other people. Some of my local game friends have done this. For some it's a matter of art production (I think), of trying their hand at game graphics. That's not exactly my thing (i.e. I'm no good at it). Instead, what I hope to get out of it is an education in the struggles & successes with a game's functionality.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><br /><br />P.S. According to my <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/profile.php?action=gamesplayeddatequery&username=MarkEJohnson&amp;amp;frommonth=01&fromday=01&amp;fromyear=2007&tomonth=12&amp;today=31&toyear=2007&amp;B1=Update">new stats on BGG</a>, in the first six weeks of the year I've played 39 games a total of 61 times. If I keep that pace, I'll end up with over 500 total plays. Yep, I thinking my family focus is actually leading me to playing MORE games than ever before. Sure, there are those Pass the Pigs games with my daughter, but also Thurn &amp; Taxis with my wife. And you know what? I had a great time playing Pass the Pigs with her! :-)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Some Essen titles (Yspahan, On the Underground, Elephant in a Porcelain Shop, and Null & Nichtig)
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>As of this writing, I've actually recorded <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> podcasts. One of them had to be scrapped for audio quality reasons, and I'm in the process of redoing it. That one is with a special guest, so I really hope I can get it redone sooner rather than later. The other is a more routine solo show, no technical problems, just needs a little more work (editing, test-listen). It's my retrospective on 2006, and a look forward to 2007. So, hopefully you'll be hearing me before long.<br /><br />In the meantime, I can share a little bit of opinion here on the blog about some Essen titles. Unless you go to Essen or BGG.con, the lag from that huge event to a local game table can take this long. It's starting to happen for us, though. Greg & Ryan, who have both been on this podcast, tried Mr. Jack a few times last month. The whole group tried Marvel Heroes when I wasn't around. So I can't comment on those, other than to imagine that the Marvel game is too long for my finicky tastes.<br /><br />When I finally made it back to game night, however, we played Yspahan. It was an immediate hit, and we played back-to-back games. (I don't know how many other groups do this, but we talk about back-to-back games a lot more than we actually do them.) And it leads to a confession of mine. I missed Ys, thought Mykerinos and Caylus were good (not great), and felt a rising contrarian emotion regarding Ystari. A little like the reaction to Days of Wonder or Fantasy Flight (or Fragor), it feels like everyone else in the hobby was acting like Ystari can do no wrong. And while I didn't find anything amiss with Ystari's offerings, neither did I understand the disproportionate outpouring of love. I mean, you don't read the same devotion to Hans im Gluck, Kosmos, or Abacus. I merely thought they had similar track records.<br /><br />That's a longwinded way of saying I didn't expect Yspahan to be as good as it is! Lots of fun gameplay, tough choices, and a healthy dose of randomness, all in a one-hour page. Is this one of Siggin's superfillers? Maybe so. Maybe that's just the sort of game I like. Both times, it felt like the game ended just as I was getting my act (i.e. point-generating engine) into gear. In fact, you feel that three times in one game, at the end of each of the game's "weeks." However, I suspect if it really were any longer, the tough choices that drive the game would lose a lot of their punch. A real winner, and one I hope makes it to a play-by-web format soon. It's a natural for that.<br /><br />By the way, I've been waiting for a game to make good use of the "die roll leftovers" mechanic I first saw in Groo. That game was fun, but ultimately too silly &amp; chaotic to really shine. The mechanic isn't quite the same in Yspahan, but it's related, and works well.<br /><br />Another Essen title tried was On The Underground. Originally I had looked past this one, too. I'm not sure why. I think it just <span style="font-style: italic;">looked</span> a little too similar to Ticket To Ride (it's not very close, mechanically). Also, I was more drawn to the other Essen subway-themed game, Metromania. I'm still interested in that one, although opinion has started to coalesce on both of these games, with OTU definitely on top. Now I have plans for our family to visit London this spring, and my interest in OTU immediately jumped up. Add in Candy's continued interest in Thurn & Taxis, and I begin to hope that this could be another family game hit. Well, I haven't tried in that setting yet (which will be 2-player), but the 5-player game we played with the SCBers was encouraging. A little fiddly to figure out the scoring paths near the middle of the game, but I've heard that diminishes quickly with experience. That feels about right. Through travel books I'm getting more familiar with the map of the Underground system and its stations, and the game's "accuracy" is a strongly appealing factor. I immediately ordered a copy for myself after that one play.<br /><br />Rounding out this Essen report are two little card games. One good, one not-so-good. The good one is Elephant in a Porcelain Shop. (The literal translation bugs me a little. Our idiom is 'bull in a china shop,' but the cards clearly show elephants all over the place. 'Porcelain shop' just doesn't have a ring to it. However, is Elephant in a China Shop any better? Probably not.) Elephant is by Michael Schacht, whose little card games will forever be compared to Coloretto. I do the same. And why not? I enjoy Coloretto so much, I keep hoping he'll have another gem like that. Uwe Rosenberg went through this after Bohnanza, right? Schacht's Diabolo was one of my stinkers for the year, but at the price &amp; size of a card game, I've got no problem trying again.<br /><br />Ok, I don't think Elephant is up there with Coloretto, but it's definitely good. We all liked it, even me. I say "even me" because I suffered a combination of bad luck and bad strategy that put me in a hole I never climbed out of. But it was still fun, and everyone else had a more competitive time. I'm a bit concerned that this will become one of those games where everyone has to be careful not to hand the game to the person on their left, balancing that against playing their own game. But we'll see, because we're definitely going to try this some more.<br /><br />Last is Null & Nichtig. Oof. It's a new twist on the trick-taking game--at least one of these is published at every Essen. Five suits, but no need to follow suit, and no trump. The "clever twist" (they all try to have one) is that the cards you collect in tricks won are separated by suit, stacked in the order collected . . . and only the one on top counts for face value. The last bit reminds me of Loco/Quandary/Flinke Pinke, but the trick-taking mechanics give a lot less control than Knizia's simple placement mechanics. In a word, it tanked. Oh well, it was worth a shot.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com">-Mark</a></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

However, as I discuss in this show, that's due to discovering a wide range of abstracts that <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> make my head hurt. You see, I've never been a fan of chess, go, logic puzzles, or anything else that requires such hard thinking. It's just not fun for me. Even then, it's not the analysis that I find as bothersome as the need to look multiple moves ahead. In this podcast, I talk about some abstracts that are considerably lighter than those, either through a smaller strategic "game space," imperfect information, or multiple players.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Links</span><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/789">Coffee Table Games</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/1102">Furniture Games</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/tag/games_as_art">BGG content tagged "Games as Art"</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/155">publisher Gigamic</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 End of the year games (part 2)
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>In addition to the games I've played with gamers to round out the year, I've continued to have more success with friends & family, too. Those are much lighter games, but that never bothered me in the first place, and of course those are much more approachable (and more fun) for people who don't enjoy learning new rules all the time. I had another chance to break out a few light games during some breaks at work. Those opportunities evaporate with the holidays, but I was happy for them while they lasted. In the past we've played good ol' Hearts, and what a great classic that is. But these coworkers know I play lots of other games, and expressed some curiosity about them. So I took that as in invitation to show them a few others, keeping them short &amp; light. The games I had onhand were Elchfest, For Sale, Coloretto, and Dynasties.<br /><br /><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/403">Elchfest</a> is one of the Kosmos/Mayfair 2-player series, a dexterity game where you try to flick disks across the table, into position as stepping stones for your wooden moose/elk piece. Your opponent takes turns doing the same, and the two of you try to reach the other side of the table (river) before the other. As simple as that, there are some subtleties around the fact that the three stepping stone disks you each have are neutral pieces--they don't belong to either player. So while it feels natural to flick just the stones on your side during your turn, before long you & your opponent are tempted--and well advised--to flick the other stones, too. Then it becomes more than a dexterity, finger-flicking face, it also adds some offensive &amp; defensive play. But flicking games aren't for everyone, and this one didn't go over too well. I still enjoy it.<br /><br />Then we had four players for <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/172">For Sale</a>, followed up by three for <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/5782">Coloretto</a>, two little card games that really show some imaginative gameplay for someone only used to traditional card games. That was the whole idea with their selection! It's funny to compare how it turned out against my attempts with those same two games and my family. At work, For Sale was interesting but not especially compelling, while they suck their teeth into Coloretto. At home it was close to the opposite, having fun with For Sale but finding Coloretto a bit too dry and requiring more tracking (and direct confrontation). In both cases I'd call the experience an overall success, just to find one hit. I guess the difference comes from the audience, though I wonder if it's really that cliché--that the family enjoys the lighter game, and the engineers want something that can be studied?<br /><br />The last one at work was <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/18745">Dynasties</a>. You'll hear me mention this one as my faux sleeper of 2006 in the next Boardgame Roundtable podcast, hosted by Doug Garrett. (It's a faux sleeper because it really came out in 2005, I just didn't find it until this year--in a math trade!) This has been my biggest hit at work. It's an area-majority game, and a bidding game. I find those unusual qualities for a 2-player game. My buddy at work requested a game with "sneakiness," and this has fit the bill. In this case, that sneakiness comes from bluffing and double-think, not backstabbing or trick plays. It was such a hit with him that he borrowed it for the Thanksgiving weekend, and now closer to Christmas I got to introduce it to someone else at work. Another success.<br /><br />On the homefront, it's been more light games with mostly my kids. Over on the <a href="http://familyboardgaming.libsyn.com/">Family Boardgaming Podcast</a> they recommended <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/6738">Quicksand</a> for parents & kids, so I snapped up a few from the recent Fantasy Flight sale to play at home and give as gifts to a cousin and the local Toys for Tots drive. Sure enough, it was a hit with my daughter. We've played with family, just the two of us, and--best of all--she wanted to teach her neighborhood friends all by herself. It's a very light game of hidden identity (as in Clans, which didn't impress the kids), a race game played with cards, themed around a jungle expedition. My favorite moment came when I helped one of Molly's friends who wasn't having as much fun as the rest of the girls. She had a hand full of cards that moved the blue pawn/explorer forward, but that wasn't her color. I whispered that she should play them all at once anyway, move the blue pawn as poorly as possible, and then get to refill her entire hand, hoping for better cards. "Ohhhhhh.....," she said, starting to get it. And then, "Good thinking!"<br /><br />I packed games into other games to save space during our trips to see relatives over the past week. However, all we played was one more game of Quicksand, and once I got to play <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/5306">Harry's Grand Slam Baseball</a> with my son. He liked it, and I hope we'll get to play more later. But nothing else, not even a game of Hearts with grandpa. What we <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> play was the Wii, Nintendo's new game system that features interactive, wireless controllers that you wave around instead of pressing a million buttons.<br /><br />Ok, here I go again. I even mention it during that Boardgame Roundtable podcast. Yes, it's a video game. But I'm telling you, we got everyone into it, had lots of fun, and the social experience was right up there (or beyond) what I brought with my in my boxes of board & card games. My brother &amp; his wife laughed through tennis, and she's pretty much opposed to all videogames. At my in-laws' we did even better, getting everyone into it. I couldn't believe how much fun my mother-in-law was having with the bowling game, cheered on by her grandkids. The golf game just about convinced my brother-in-law to go out and get a system for his family. The nieces played constantly. It's not unusual for kids to play videogames, of course, but even the littlest one found it easy and intuitive to play. We all got into it <span style="font-style: italic;">together</span>, and that's what felt so special.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 End of the year games (part 1)
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Like I said, no chance to do another podcast this year, but I can fill you in on some recent gaming via the blog. Last night I attended my last Santa Clarita game group session of the year, and we were joined by Greg Parker. He's a long way from home up in Redding, but has family down here so we see him once in a while during holidays. Podcast listeners should be familiar with Greg from his co-star status on <a href="http://www.garrettsgames.com/">Garrett's Games & Geekiness podcast</a>. Although I'd like to have him on MY podcast, too, our time is too short to do that AND play games. So games it was.<br /><br />I think of Greg Parker as one of the "new games guys," meaning someone that is always  getting &amp; playing new stuff.  I know he has his older favorites, too, but whenever he's down here there are new games he's touting, and asking about what new ones we've tried. Should I tell him the game sessions at my place are often filled with old standbys like Ra and San Marco? No, I know it doesn't really matter. And we play new ones, too--including Space Dealer last week. (Which I thought was great fun, such an enjoyable gimmick/mechanism, and one I want to try more.)<br /><br />Greg had a new copy of Die Baumeister von Arkadia with him, and that was a new one I wanted try. Especially since I knew no one in our group had picked it up yet. Just like everyone's been saying, it was good. It looks more involved than it really is, and in our 4-player game it also accelerated to the end more than we were expecting. Now knowing what to expect, I can see this moving right along in that 45-60 minute middleweight category I like. Count me among those who were turned off by nothing more than the Torres memories of those pieces, but hre's they're just game scoring equipment (and a game timer, in a clever combination). If it also plays well with 2 or 3, as I've heard, then it's one of the clear winners from Essen.<br /><br />After that we tried Reef Encounters of the Second Kind. Turns out I was able to get one after all, due to my high-falutin' podcast connections. (I saw them available through Boulder Games later, too.) Hmmm... Now, I'm a big fan of Reef Encounter. You'll hear more about that in a future podcast or two. I don't typically pay top dollar for games, but this was one case where I splurged. That was for the base game. It was a double-splurge for the small expansion. Especially since I know my usual reaction to expansions: interesting new options, but clutters-up the original game and makes it only for die-hards. And that's almost my reaction here. I say "almost," because I want to try again using only some of the new elements. The rules don't suggest you can "pick & choose" the parts of the expansion you want, but I think it could work better for me that way. I like the special tiles most of all. They don't take much additional explanation, barely tweak the rules, and open up new tactical considerations and opportunities. Especially when drafting more tiles at the end of your turn. The predatory starfish tile is only slightly more involved, but pretty interesting and worth the (minor) effort.<br /><br />It's the special, rule-bending cards I didn't care for. This is a game mechanism I'm not often happy with. Adds more chaos/unpredictability, and getting the balanced for power is so very critical. It's only one play so far, but in our game we all felt the cards were too powerful, changing the final scoring too significantly for a game that otherwise values clever moves and multi-turn strategy.<br /><br />The remaining new element are the blue shrimps. I like their modest game effect. They're a collective pool of "bonus" shrimp that can protect more coral--only the tile they're on, not the orthogonal neighbors, but that's plenty to help out. Some of them are printed on the new tiles, and those are the easiest to use. The separate, wooden ones are fun, just like the original "shrimples," offer more opportunities for clever play, but as-is they require that same deck of cards to activate. If I can figure out some way to retain the blue shrimp but ditch the cards, that would be ideal. (Maybe discard a tile in front of the screen to place/move one blue shrimp?)<br /><br />All in all, a good night of strategy games to complement the lighter fare I've been playing lately, which you'll read about in part 2.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

You know that getting a podcast out during this part of the year is tricky for me (aren't we all busy with the holidays?), and with the backlog of material it has turned out to be a biggie. Good news, I hope. The last time I had a show larger than one audio CD, almost no one downloaded the split file--everyone downloaded the big sucker like usual. So either you've got MP3 players, listen on your computers, or manage your own splits as needed. Yea!<br /><br />This show is mostly a compilation of older material that hadn't been broadcast yet for one reason or another. There's a session report and some general discussion from last August, and a backlog of audio feedback--half of it from Mark Jackson. (Remember, he's the preacher, I'm the rocket scientist . . . kind of.)<br /><br />But I couldn't just splice in that feedback without responding to it, and I wanted to fill you in on some recent events, too. Mostly, that means when my folks came down for Thanksgiving. Did we all play games? Yeah, kind of, but not what you'd expect. And then I had the happy surprise of a thank-you gift for this podcast that turned out to be a fun game for the family, one I wanted to mention right away.<br /><br />So, anyway, there you have it. All 85 minutes of it. Enjoy!<br /><br />-Mark<br /><br />P.S. Once again the good folks over at the <a href="http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2006/12/gone-gaming-2006-board-game-internet.html">Gone Gaming</a> blog are calling attention to the best internet resources for our hobby. They call it the Board Game Internet Awards, and this is the second year they've done this. Sure, everyone knows to go to Boardgamegeek and Boardgamenews for news & information. But which are the best blogs, game club sites, even <span style="font-style: italic;">podcasts</span>? Not only that, but they'll single out the best individual game reviews, session reports, and humorous articles. I'm very proud to be nominated again, and really appreciate the spotlight they're shining on quality online material, all of it by enthusiastic hobbyists.<br /><br />P.P.S. I don't do full-blown shownotes with links to everything anymore, but in this recording I specifically mentioned a link to the <a href="http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=666">Interview with an Optimist that Tom Vasel did with HSGB designer Harry Obst</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Well, that was a good idea, because this is just a very busy time for me to work in some podcasting. Just the same, I wanted to catch up on some audio feedback, and my plan is <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> to put together kind of a "mash-up" show.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>My best chance for playing games with Molly is when she's bored, having exhausted all other options. That sounds bad, but when that happens she's not reduced to playing a boardgame with dad--she looks forward to it. She just looks forward to it after everything else falls through. :-) Hey, I'll take it. Recently her friends have been busy doing other things, so we've had several days over the past couple weeks where we've played some titles. Our existing wooden faves sitting on the table, Pylos and Diam, were recently joined by a couple more I ordered. Batik, another from Gigamic, is 80% placement strategy, 20% dexterity, an interesting combination. Also attractive and quick-playing, it was an instant hit. The other was Katamino, which is mostly a simple game wrapped around a nice set of pentominoes. After playing it with her for a while I could understand why it has stickers for various parent & educational awards.<br /><br />That's all good enough, but I had to chuckle when she excitedly asked yesterday if the box received in the mail was a new game. Between being the game-order guy with my group and participating in math trades, there's a steady trickle of games coming and going around this house. She's never shown much interest in that before, but now she's excited by the prospect! (Ironically, this particular box <span style="font-style: italic;">wasn't</span> a game, it was something I'd ordered for Christmas.)<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><br /><br />P.S.

	 Not at BGG.con
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Nope, I didn't make it back to BGG.con this year. I never manage to be a regular attendee of conventions--even though I've been to many of them once. Last year it was BGG.con, the year before was the Gathering, before that was Essen, and before <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> was Kublacon when Knizia was there. A few years prior I was lucky enough to go to Gulf Games. All of these have been great fun, and hopefully someday I'll return to a few of them. BGG.con, especially, has a lot of my local friends this year, plus lots more internet friends and listeners. Who knows? Maybe I'll make it back in 2007.<br /><br />In the meantime, we're still playing games here on the home front. Friday night was SCB, and even with a small turnout of 3 gamers (others were at BGG.con!) we had a good time. In fact, 3-players doesn't restrict your game night at all, something I may bring up in a podcast. Better yet, my daughter Molly was excited that games were at our house, and played several light openers with us. I knew she'd ask for Cloud 9, a solid favorite, but we've played that a lot lately and I wanted to try something else. Looking over the shelves I spotted a couple more she'd learned in the past: Dancing Dice and Hick Hack in Gackelwack. To that I added Raj, which I think is fast fun with nice, plastic tiles.<br /><br />Raj kind of underwhelmed her (it did with Sam when I tried it him, too), so I wonder why I keep hanging onto this one. I need them to try it with the full complement of players, so more people get zapped by ties. Dancing Dice, on the other hand, was a hit. Again. This one is definitely a keeper among dice games--we played again last night with just the family. Hick Hack was another good one, a title I hadn't touched in a couple years, probably. The more the merrier with this game.<br /><br />Then it was time for just the grown-ups. We'd expected to have just 3 players, and picked two games that excel with that number: End of the Triumvirate and San Marco.<br /><br />I've also played Dynasties a few times over a couple lunch hours at work. I think is a fantastic little 2-player gem. In fact, a podcast I should do in the future is one comparing three interesting 2-player games: Dynasties, Aton, and En Garde. All use pretty simple decks of numbered cards to very different, interesting ends. (I guess you could lump Lost Cities in there, but everyone knows that one. What about Clash of the Lightsabers, though?)<br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

A few weeks ago I talked about the games I was interested in hearing more about at Essen.

Be sure to also read Mike's column (the "<a href="http://www.funagain.com/control/viewblog?contentBlogId=1">Gamer's Notebook</a>") at Funagain on the same subject. <br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

I was lucky enough to be <a href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/Essen2003.shtml">there in 2003</a>, something that may never happen again. But you don't have to GO to Essen to be excited about all of the new game releases. Some of them have already been available for purchase from vendors, but most are making their debut this week. You can place an overseas order next week, wait a bit longer for various game importers to carry the titles. Or maybe you're lucky enough to know someone that's going in-person, someone with a little extra luggage space to pick up a few titles for you and bring them back.<br /><br />Whatever your options, there's plenty to get excited about. As busy as I've been, I still make some time to scan the incredible <a href="http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/convention_preview_essen_2006">Convention Preview page for Essen</a> at <a href="http://www.boardgamenews.com">BoardgameNews.com</a>. It's so big, it has to be split into <a href="http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/convention_preview_essen_2006_publishers_n_z">TWO pages</a>. Don't kill a forest by printing it out, especially when it gets updated so frequently. Maybe the updates have finally stopped, but that's only because Rick himself is on an airplane, heading to Germany to report on the show in-person. Go back to BoardgameNews.com to catch his updates, including photos. This time he's hoping to post some videos, too, which would be fantastic.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

But in this episode I explain how a combination of internal choices & external pressures has led to this major slowdown of Boardgames To Go.<br /><br />To be honest, I think I sound a little rusty in this one. But it'll come back to me. I'm looking forward to talking about some games again. I think I may even go back and salvage some of that earlier show I recorded (but never posted) in August.<br /><br />What I should do--as a comment on this blog pointed out--is just <span style="font-style: italic;">post</span> to the blog every once in a while. Not only does this let my listeners know I'm still out here, still ok (thanks for caring!), I could even include an opinion or two.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm happy to finally get this show uploaded.

Like the last time I (unintentionally) took a little time off from the podcast, it was a little hard to get back into the swing of things. Last time I thought a simpler Session Report and Feedback show was the way to get back into the podcasting groove, but this time I wanted to try a theme show. That's because I'd been hearing the excellent series hosted by Eric Burgess on his <a href="http://boardgamebabylon.com">Boardgame Babylon</a> podcast, one he calls the "Demise & Rise of the FLGS."<br /><br />You'll hear from this episode of BGTG that I don't share the same feelings about game stores. Not that I have anything against them, it's just that I don't find that they provide much of a service that I need. At least, not today. It was different when I was in high school, when the only way to even discover new games--let alone buy them--was to go to a game store. But that was a long time ago, and the business side of the hobby has changed. Sure seems that way to me, anyway.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /></a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I've been playing play-by-web Hacienda for a while on <a href="http://Yucata.de">Yucata.de</a>. They even just started offering alternate maps (at least one). But now <a href="http://spielbyweb.com">SpielByWeb.com</a> also has Hacienda, and I like their game manager interface much better. For one thing, I'm able to create password-protected games just for my podcast listeners! You know the drill . . . go to the site, look for a game with Boardgames To Go in the title, and always use BGTG as the password. I haven't played this game on their site yet, so I don't know the interface. But everything Mikael and his developers put up at SpielByWeb is very slick, so I'm confident it'll work well.<br /><br />I went with the asymmetric map, the one I believe is included on the backside of the board in the published game. There are other options to upload custom maps made with the Westpark Gamers' map generator program. So, lots of good opportunities to try this game under better conditions. You heard in my last podcast how I've been disappointed with Hacienda, but maybe these new maps will make a big difference.<br /><br />The game options on the website offer a score-as-you-go variant (which I picked), and an alternate market scoring variant (which I avoided).<br /><br />-Mark<br /><br />P.S. I wrote a show outline for the next podcast last night. A new recording is coming soon, honest! :-)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I've been advised in feedback to stop apologizing for being late on my podcasts. So I won't do that anymore, but I will point out that I'm more disappointed than anyone. I think from now on I'll plan on taking a 6-week hiatus from mid-June to the end of July, and another from mid-November to the end of the year. In fact, I've done both of those now--the trick is to <span style="font-style: italic;">plan</span> for that in the future. Fellow podcaster Paul Tevis of <a href="http://www.havegameswilltravel.net"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have Games, Will Travel</span></a> takes breaks now & then, and in between those he says his podcast has distinct seasons. Sounds like a good idea to me, one I wish I'd done earlier.<br /><br />Like before, the hardest part of getting back into the podcasts is doing the next one. If nothing else, I can do a session report show. But I'd rather do a themed show of some sort. Not only did my podcasting take some time off, I also went a few weeks without a regular game night. Bummer. I still got in some other games with my family, but that's a different kind of gaming. In fact, that's something my listeners will remember I've been wanting to record a podcast about.<br /><br />Hmm, what have I been playing lately? I managed to have one game night at my place last week, and there I got to play For Sale, Dancing Dice, Samurai, I'm The Boss, Make Five, and Hyle 7 (the last two are abstracts, less well known). At a previous game night the month before we played Big Manitou and Mü. That session included Greg Parker, who joins us when he's visiting family in the area (Greg has been on the Garretts Games &amp; Geekiness podcast.) Big Manitou was a lot better with the right rules, let me tell you. I still prefer the simpler original, however. Mü is one I've thought about featuring in an All About show. I'm far from an expert, but I've played enough to discuss the game. Mostly, I think it's the sort of game that warrants the level of discussion.<br /><br />The show I think I'll record first, however, is one talking about my experiences with game stores. I heard some talk about this on <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.thedicetower.com">The Dice Tower</a>, but what really sparked my brain was hearing Eric Burgess' fascinating <a href="http://www.boardgamebabylon.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boardgame Babylon</span></a> series he calls "The Demise and Rise of the Friendly, Local Game Store."<br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Rather than include that in the Vinci show, I clipped that part out to be used later. Something similar happened when Dave turned the tables on me for the "Dark Johnson" interview, when we got into some discussion about Elasund. Though it didn't really fit with that interview, it was too good to throw away.<br /><br />So that's what this show is--a mash-up of these other segments,  interspersed with some more recent commentary by yours truly. Then I felt it was finally time to back up the parting shot I took at Hacienda some time ago. At least one podcast listener has been waiting for me to back up those comments. We'll see how I did.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Links</span><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/46">Medici </a>(<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/112392">BGG thread about the new edition</a>)<br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19526">Elasund</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19100">Hacienda</a><br /><a href="http://www.yucata.de/default.aspx?PageID=6&amp;name=Hazienda.html">Yucata.de</a><br /><a href="http://funagain.com/control/viewblog?contentBlogId=1">Mike Siggins' Gamers Notebook column at Funagain</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Because I often think of things I missed after the podcast is finished. (It's not just me--the host for the  <span style="font-weight: bold;">highly recommended</span> BBC Radio 4 program <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/"><span style="font-style: italic;">In Our Time</span></a> does the same thing via post-show emails.)<br /><br />I really want to talk about the family gaming (and other non-gamer gaming) I've been doing lately, but that show takes a little more prep. Hopefully next week. Also, I haven't forgotten that I still owe everyone more explanation about my lack of enthusiasm for Hacienda and Elasund. What can I say? The SdJ jury agrees with me! :-) Ok, cheap shot. I'll still share this as part of that "Dave Arnott leftovers" show.<br /><br />By the way, I've all but given up on playing Vassal anytime soon. Now I've actually got two people who have volunteered to help me (or learn with me). And I still want to do that. However, it's going to only be a little bit at a time. (Because if I had more time than that to poke around on the computer regarding boardgames, I'd be recording more podcasts!!) For the moment I've let my play-by-web games wind down to completion, taking a break from starting other ones up. But I'll definitely get back into those again, especially when a new game is added to the lineup.<br /><br />Oh, and you've got to read this butchered english translation of the rules to Safeknacker. Clearly, this is a machine-translation with minimal touching up for idioms. It begins...<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Hey, let us gather hot cash! We have a beautiful society of evil boys here: safecrackers by occupation. Five worthy families contend in the not quite voluntary teamwork.</span><br /></blockquote>And the ending is just as good!<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">...The game ends as soon as all safes are cracked. Now cash is counted the carried off. The winner, with the most hot cash in their pocket, is more or less enviously celebrated. However only briefly, because immediately Schimunsky comes and snatches you anyway. Then in the clink - fraternally unites - could they dare a game-ette again... </span><br /></blockquote>I don't mean to tease. I'm just tickled to see this, having struggled with a few translations myself. After you type all that German in, pipe it through babelfish or something, you're just happy to get something out the other side that lets you play the game. You've got no energy left to deal with this.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Links </span><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/deutscher_spiele_preis_voting_now_open/">Vote for the Deutscher Spiele Preis!</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist.php3?action=view&listid=672">Geeklist on past DSP winners</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4394">Settlers of the Stone Age</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/878">Wyatt Earp</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3349">Die Safeknacker</a> (and Searauber)<br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/118">Modern Art</a><br /><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2987">Pirate's Cove</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Just for curiosity's sake. Those of you with more interest in podcasting ought to at least lurk on the <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/boardgamepodcasters">boardgamepodcasters Yahoo group</a>.<br /><br />Measuring the number of folks listening to podcasts is an inexact science. The closest you can get is measuring downloads, but you never know how many people share a single download (such as with an audio CD), how many downloads are trashed without ever being heard, or how many individual listeners download the same show more than once. But I'm an engineer, not a scientist, so I've got no problem working with estimated figures to draw meaningful conclusions. (I guess lots of professions do this, too.)<br /><br />So even with the inexact information I get from download data, I can still figure out that I've got an audience somewhere around 1000. It grew to that number over a six-month period, or maybe a little longer, and has now flattened out. Just about every show ultimately ends up with those sort of numbers. About three-quarters of those downloads occur in the first few days, split about evenly between automated downloads and folks who go get my show after seeing the small announcement in the BGG forum. The rest is the loooong tail that slowly fills in over months. And months. I still get a few downloads every day for some of my oldest shows, now stretching back more than a year.<br /><br />Although the podcast's overall listener numbers are remarkably consistent, there are three shows that have had 50% more downloads than the rest. When I looked at which ones, the answers surprised me a little. I get the most positive feedback about the All About shows, but their listener numbers hover right around the 1000 mark, like the other episodes. Nope, the most popular downloaded shows are<br /><ul><li>The Essen show I did with Mike Siggins</li><li>The nostalgia/storytelling show about my days with Steve Jackson Games</li><li>And the very first show!</li></ul>I figure there's just a lot of interest in Essen (or Siggins, or both), and the SJ Games show probably brought in other listeners that downloaded just that single show. But the first show, oof! I guess it makes sense, to want to go back to the very beginning. I used to have the shows going all the way back downloadable via iTunes. I'm not sure if that's still possible, or at least easy. But wow, now I really wish I could point listeners who want to start at "the beginning" to a different show that served as a more polished introduction to this podcast. I wonder how many listened to that first one and gave up due to my monotone voice and microphone hiss? :-)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /><br />They are the Essen show I did with Mike Siggins,<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I wish I could be putting out more podcasts. I've got lots of ideas, some guests lined up (some have been waiting for months!), some partial shows recorded, and outlines for future shows. What I don't have is the time or energy to have finished them already.<br /><br />Actually, that's not true. I do have the time, and sometimes I even have the energy. However, my success in a personal goal for my hobby--dialing back my intensity/involvement and playing more games with my family--has impacted the podcast. I'm spending more time playing with my kids. Sometimes that's boardgames, sometimes it's videogames, sometimes it's catch in the front yard. And I'm not consuming boardgaming content with all of my leisure time--sometimes I'm watching TV with my wife, reading a book, or even exercising. All good choices, right?<br /><br />Right, they absolutely are. They just come at a cost to my hobby. Some folks can do all of these things and not miss a beat with their avid boardgaming, but I've never been able to pull that off. And so the podcast is delayed.<br /><br />Not forever, don't worry. In fact, I think I'll get a show out by the weekend at the latest. I still love doing them, and I'm still going to do them.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>P.S. And now you've got a glimpse of what a future show is going to be about. Not the next one, though--that's supposed to be an overdue session report + feedback show, talking about TtR:Märklin, Buy Low Sell High, and Dschunke. The "David Arnott Leftovers" show is also in the pipeline, catching up with some comments about Medici, Elasund, and Hacienda.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Up until just recently that always meant Germany--albeit from a few different webshops--but last week I placed an order through a Dutch website, too. I organize most of these  group buys for the Santa Clarita Boardgamers, and there's something to learn from it. The websites are getting more and more English content, but there are times you still need to keep an online translator open in another browser window. I found it intimidating at first, but now it's pretty easy.<br /><br />However, now we don't order overseas so often. A poor currency exchange rate between the US$ and Euro, combined with greater domestic inventory of timely English-language editions of German games (often at discounted prices and cheap-or-free shipping) means the overseas order is more specialized. While there's no longer much reason to buy new games from the major publishers overseas, there are still some closeouts, OOPs, or untranslated games from smaller publishers that are most economically ordered from Europe.<br /><br />Something I neglected to point out in the podcast is that the closeout pricelist for these European stores changes throughout the year, especially shortly after Essen. During my one trip there in 2003 I struggled to make room in my suitcase for an 11 Euro copy of Giganten. There were lots of those available at the fair. Then when I got home I watched multiple online vendors put the same game on their discount list, at about the same price. So I could've nabbed my "Essen special" just be shopping the lists from home! This opportunity doesn't always happen, but it's worth keeping your eye out for it.<br /><br />One other thing about the VAT discount. Most shops give you the discount during the ordering or payment process. It might not be until the very end, though. Also, the Dutch store I've just used gave me back the VAT discount as a PayPal refund after I'd placed the full-price order (something they clearly explained upfront). And there was one time that a AllGames4You forgot to give me the discount at all, but they made good on it after an email exchange.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Mark@BoardgamesToGo.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">-Mark</span></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Links</span><br /><a href="http://www.adam-spielt.de/phpshop/index.php?sp=1">Adam Spielt</a> (German)<br /><a href="http://vnh2.hsk-net.de/cgi-bin/playme.storefront/">Playme.de</a> (German)<br /><a href="http://www.all-games.de/Versand/Bedingungen/Englische_AGB/englische_agb.html">AllGames4You</a> (German)<br /><a href="http://magnus-spiele.de/versandliste.html">Magnus Spiele</a> (German)<br /><a href="http://www.jocade.fr/">Jocade</a> (French)<br /><a href="http://aucoindujeu.com/cgi-bin/acdj/process/locale/en_US/currency/fr_FR/page/shipping.html?id=g3Lya3df">Au Coin du Jeu</a> (French)<br /><a href="http://besteleenspel.nl/">Bestel een Spel</a> (Dutch)<br /><a href="http://levalet.com/">Le Valet d'Coeur </a>(French Canadian)<br /><a href="http://BoardgamesToGo.com/Sample%20overseas%20ordering%20spreadsheet.xls">One of my game order spreadsheets</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

No, not at the Gathering of Friends, I was in Hawaii with my family. I thought I might catch up on a little podcasting backlog or at least spruce up the web page. Instead, I ended up doing what I should've planned on all along--relaxing! That's why this show recorded at the end of March is just being posted now.<br /><br />But here it is, the All About Vinci show. I announced this ahead of time with the thought that people could play the game, review the rules, etc. This is a longer show--as all of the All Abouts turn out to be--and I figure that level of discussion makes the most sense when the listener is already familiar with the game. And if <em>that's</em> the case, then maybe we don't need to go over the rules in such depth? I ask that question in the opening of this podcast, something I'd like to hear back about.<br /><br />By the way, if you want to skip past the rules, just scan your CD or MP3 player forward to about 30:45 after you get through my intro. You'll miss a little commentary &amp; analysis that squeezes its way in amongst the rules overview, but not too much.<br /><br />Anyway, that's Dave and I recording the podcast in the photo, of course. I'm on the right, and we're using the simple headsets + audio splitter setup that costs less than $50. (Ok, you need to have a computer already, but the recording software is also free.) We're at an upstairs table during <a href="http://www.socalgamesday.com">SoCal Games Day</a> 25, at the Burbank Moose Lodge.
