<!-- MAIN TEXT -->
<H3>Research interests</H3>
<P>The focus of my research is Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, the study of functional brain development over the first years of life.  The key questions that motivate my research concern how specialized cognitive functions emerge within particular brain regions (such as the cerebral cortex) during development.  Within this approach my research focuses on the perception and cognition of the social and physical world over the early years. We adopt an "interactive specialisation" framework for thinking about human functional brain development (see my book ìDevelopmental Cognitive Neuroscienceî, Blackwell, 2005, for a summary of this).  Much of this research is conducted collaboratively with other members of the Centre for Brain & Cognitive Development, though we also collaborate with other labs in the US, Europe, and Japan.</P>

<P><B>The development of the social brain</B></P>
<P>Within this topic, we study face perception, eye-gaze perception and eye-gaze cued action, and the perception of human action. Through imaging (ERP, NIRS) and behavioural testing methods, our goal is understand the typical and atypical development of the human social brain network. </P>

<P><B>Developing an understanding of the physical world</B></P>
<P>Within this area we study object processing and action in the dorsal and ventral streams, object-centred attention, visual masking, perceptual binding, and the representation of occluded objects. In addition to conventional brain correlates of perception, we study event-related oscillations (ERO).</P>

<P><B>The development of prefrontal cortex function</B></P>
<P>It is often assumed that the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain most associated with higher cognitive functions) is "functionally silent" for the first year after birth.  However, recent evidence reveals activation of this area from at least the first months.  We are conducting longitudinal individual differences studies to trace the early emergence of functions attributed to PFC.</P>

<P><B>Infants at-risk for autism</B></P>
<P>A longstanding research interest has concerned how Autism develops over the first year of life.  It is possible that overt behavioral symptoms of Autism only emerge toward the end of the first year of life.  We are studying groups of infants at-risk for autism (such as the younger siblings of children already diagnosed) to trace the earliest brain and cognitive signs of autism.  In the longer term, early identification may lead to better intervention strategies.</P>

<P>The core funding for my laboratory comes from the UK Medical Research Council.</P>

<H3>My Career</H3>
<P>I chose to conduct my undergraduate studies at the University of Edinburgh, since I could combine courses from basic biology with those on psychology.  During these studies I became particularly fascinated with developmental biology and developmental psychology.  I was struck, however, with how separate these two disciplines were at that time. As a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Gabriel Horn and Pat Bateson, I found a natural home for my interest in relating brain development, and early experience, to behavioural development. I also learned about the necessity of using multiple converging methodologies from genetics, neuroscience, and psychology, to address these issues. After completing my PhD I was fortunate to join the newly formed MRC Cognitive Development Unit in London, under the Directorship of John Morton.  Here I developed my interest in studying human infants, and enjoyed the freedom of postdoctoral years to develop and expand theoretical ideas on the development of perception, especially face processing.  A logical consequence of this work was to understand the mechanisms that underlie the looking-time based behavioral measures used to study human infants.  This took me to spend an enjoyable year (spread over two) with Mike Posner and Mary Rothbart at the University of Oregon, Eugene. This productive time advanced my interest in the development of visual orienting and attention, and further reinforced to me the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to development.</P>

<P>In 1991 I joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as Associate Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, and was fortunate to recruit Leslie Tucker from Oregon as my lab manager. Over the ensuing years, Leslieís role has expanded with the size of the research group to her present position at Birkbeck of Centre Co-ordinator.  At CMU my growing interest in neural network and connectionist models was nourished, and I benefited from some outstanding colleagues and students. In 1994 I returned to London to re-join the MRC Cognitive Development Unit as a Senior Research Scientist.  At this time we were keen to establish an infant ERP/EEG lab, and we were fortunate to recruit Gergely Csibra from Budapest to lead this.  Gergoís unique combination of technical and theoretical skills allowed us to become one of the first few labs in the world to undertake high-density ERP studies in young infants.  In 1997 I took up the chair of Psychology at Birkbeck, University of London, and shortly after the lab moved to "our" building, 32 Torrington Square, to form the new "Centre for Brain & Cognitive Development" (CBCD) along with Denis Mareschal.</P>

<P>Since 1997 the CBCD has expanded rapidly and includes many excellent new colleagues such as Michael Thomas, Fred Dick, Jennifer Aydelott and several others.  In 2006 we, along with Martin Eimer, are moving into a new building (the Henry Welcome Building) designed around our scientific needs.  Our current research interests are outlined above.</P>
