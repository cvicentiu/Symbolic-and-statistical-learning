        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <font size="+3">A</font>s computer use becomes more wide-spread, 
          <i>usability</i> becomes an increasing concern. Usability 
          addresses issues such as learnability, intuitiveness, usefulness, 
          efficiency, and cultural appropriateness of computer software. 
          Specific guidelines have been created by individuals such as 
          <a href="http://www.sun.com/columns/jakob/index.html" target="win2">Jakob Nielsen</a> 
          that define the balance that a designer must negotiate when 
          attempting to satisfy the requirements of usability. These days, 
          the importance of usability can be seen just in the number of 
          names it has: ergonomics, HMI (human-machine interface), 
          HCI (human-computer interaction), CHI (computer-human interaction), 
          UCD (user-centered design), HF (human factors), and UID (user 
          interface design), to name a few. In this article, I will often 
          use the phrase "interface design" interchangeably with "usability."
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Interface design consists primarily of two halves: 
          designing displays, and designing human interactivity. 
          The main objective of display design is typically to create 
          transparent views into the information space being accessed. 
          It is important that the frame--everything that is used to 
          display and contextualize the information--does not distract 
          the user from the information itself. In short, display design 
          is about creating transparent windows into the information space 
          that emphasize the depth of the space, not the surface and frame 
          of the display. The primary goal of designing human-computer 
          interaction, on the other hand, is to create opaque objects that 
          map the information space and afford direct manipulation that 
          guides and constrains human interactions to reduce the memory 
          load on the individual. In this case, the emphasis is on the 
          interactions between the user and the frame and how they can 
          manipulate the information.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          One might notice that these two sides of interface design parallel 
          the dichotomy characterized by the differences between early 
          Italian perspective painting and Dutch modernist art--the opposing 
          forces of transparency vs. opacity, window vs. map, and depth vs. 
          surface. In the genealogy of visual representation, user interface 
          design is breaking new ground by uniting many of the characteristics 
          that are traditionally opposed.  Interactive screens are uniting 
          depth and surface.

        </p>
        <p>
          For years, user interface design of computer software has moved 
          to embrace the notion of the <em>Graphical User Interface</em> 
          (GUI). In most cases, GUI's take the form of a <i>windowing</i> 
          environment--one that provides multiple windows or views into 
          the information space that the software accesses. Some common 
          examples are the Macintosh Operating System, Microsoft Windows, 
          and X Windows for UNIX. In all three cases, the metaphor of a 
          desktop is used in which the surface of the screen represents 
          the surface of a desk, upon which may be placed items such as 
          documents, folders, and tools.
        </p>

            <b>
              Figure 1. Overlapping windows atop a blue textured desktop.
            </b>
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The central component of GUI's, the window, is an element of depth. 
          Each window opens into the potentially infinite universe of the 
          information space. While many applications, such as word processors 
          and spreadsheets, tend to have very flat information spaces, other 
          applications like 3D modelers can literally have almost 
          infinite depth. Windows primarily serve the display aspect of 
          interface design, providing transparent views into the depths of 
          the information space.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The desktop itself, however, is primarily surface oriented. It serves 
          the interaction aspect of interface design in that it provides a way 
          of manipulating and organizing the collection of windows. Relative 
          to the desktop, the windows themselves become the information space. 
          The frames around the windows are the opaque objects that can be 
          seized and dragged about. The desktop has only a limited sense of 
          depth in that the windows may overlap and are sometimes adorned 
          with bevelled edges.  But all of this is done to augment the sense 
          of surface--surface that can be grabbed and manipulated.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          When viewing this standard kind of graphical interface, one 
          merely needs to change one's focus to switch from a depth-oriented 
          to a surface-oriented visual representation. With a simple change 
          of mental context, the windows can become merely objects scattered 
          across the surface of the screen. Switch back, and one is peering 
          into the deep void of another information space. And all along, 
          nothing on the screen has changed.

          <font size="5">Layers of Interactivity</font>
        </p>
        <p>
          Early GUI interfaces tended to be very flat, like the example 
          windows shown in <a href="index.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>. The sense of 
          depth was derived almost solely from the overlap of the windows. 
          Except in a few applications whose specific purpose was to display 
          3D representations, a majority of the tools and controls within 
          a window tended to have no overlapping areas, lighting effects, 
          or drop shadows. More recent GUI designs, however, have begun to 
          incorporate layers of depth within the window, which correspond to 
          the levels of interactivity they provide. The Netscape web browser 
          <a href="index.html#figure2">shown below</a>, for example, demonstrates this 
          sort of design.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a name="figure2"><img src="Netscape1.gif" alt="[Image: Netscape Web Browser]" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The browser shows three distinct layers of interactivity. The 
          top layer, emphasized in <a href="index.html#figure3">Figure 3</a> below, 
          corresponds to buttons. No other controls appear at this level. 
          As the highest controls on the window, they naturally encourage 
          direct manipulation--interaction focused directly on the object 
          itself.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a name="figure3"><img src="Netscape2.gif" alt="[Image: Netscape Web Browser with buttons highlighted]" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>

            <b>

            </b>
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the middle layer (shown in <a href="index.html#figure4">Figure 4</a>) 
          appear labels and other non-interactive components. This layer, 
          sandwiched between the higher and lower levels is intuitively the 
          most neutral, the most inert. It does not encourage interactivity 
          as do the other two layers, but does serve a mapping function by 
          labelling and categorizing the information spaces.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a name="figure4"><img src="Netscape3.gif" alt="[Image: Netscape Web Browser with labels highlighted]" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>

          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the bottom layer appear all of the interactive components 
          that are not buttons. For example, in <a href="index.html#figure5">the 
          figure below</a>, the Location text field and the web page 
          itself appear on this third layer. The bottom layer, one could 
          argue, would tend to discourage any sort of direct manipulation 
          such as with the pointing device. However, it can also be argued 
          that the depressions in the window serve as <i>wells</i> or 
          <i>pools</i>, attracting information content. And in fact, it is 
          often in these <i>information pools</i> that you find the bulk 
          of the content of the window.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a name="figure5"><img src="Netscape4.gif" alt="[Image: Netscape Web Browser with text fields highlighted]" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>
          <font size="-1" face="2Stone Sans,Arial,Helvetica">
            <b>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          What is particularly interesting about these layers of interactivity 
          is that the top two layers, those of buttons and labels, form a sort 
          of frame within the frame of the window. The bottom layer, containing 
          the information pools, tends less to provide frames and more to 
          provide views.  In other words, the higher layers provide the 
          direct manipulation and maps for manipulating, organizing, and 
          conceptualizing the information, while the lowest level provides 
          the transparent views into the information spaces, paralleling the 
          relationship between windows and the desktop.

          In games and multimedia software, where there is less emphasis on 
          rigid user interface standards, thus providing greater freedom to 
          work with the aesthetics of a piece, there is a strong movement 
          toward 3D console-type interfaces. These interfaces are continuing 
          to blur the lines between window and frame.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          For example, in <a href="index.html#figure6">Figure 6</a> below, the 
          application recreates the likeness of a computer screen within 
          its own frame. Although this technique still parallels the 
          window-desktop relationship, it draws more attention to the 
          console screen as a surface as well as a window.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The various interface components of the Multimedia Music 
          application shown in <a href="index.html#figure7">Figure 7</a>, are 
          still divided in a relatively traditional manner between window 
          and frame. However, it is far more difficult to distinguish 
          one from the other. In fact, much of the "frame" in this case 
          (everything surrounding the curled sheet of paper), is itself 
          a window onto another broader information space that 
          contextualizes the information that appears on the paper.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

          </font>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In the third example, <a href="index.html#figure8">below</a>, the distinction 
          between window and frame has been all but removed. The object and 
          the information are united, mapped and displayed simultaneously. 
          The display itself is the object to be manipulated.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          While some of the most advanced work in breaking down the dichotomy 
          between window and frame is taking place in multimedia and game 
          development, that is not to say that these new united ways of 
          representing and interacting with visual information spaces 
          will not begin to trickle into the standard applications market. 
          In fact, the Kai Power Tools 3.0 <i>MetaToys</i> device shown in 
          <a href="index.html#figure9">Figure 9</a> demonstrates one of the most 
          advanced user interface designs in which the object that is 
          manipulated and the view that it affords are entirely united. 
          In the image below, both the traditional windows and desktop 
          are literally left in the shadow of the future of user 
          interface design.

          Computer use brings one very important characteristic to the 
          genealogy of visual representation--interactivity. Few media 
          have relied so heavily upon the action of the user or viewer as do 
          digital media. As a result, interactivity has become a driving force 
          behind the movement toward new forms of visual representation that 
          attempt to balance transparent displays of information with opaque 
          objects that facilitate the mapping and manipulation of these 
          information spaces. In essence, the requirements of usability are 
          driving interactive screens to unite depth and surface.
