A former Olympic wrestler and NCAA All-American, Mark Johnson begins his 15th season at the University of Illinois. During the Johnson tenure, Illinois has finished in the Top-10 at the NCAA championships on nine occasions and in the Top-12 for the last 12 seasons. Johnson has led the Illinois program to more wins, NCAA Champions, NCAA qualifiers and All-Americans than any coach in the school's history. He has compiled a 176-39-4 record over the last 15 years, for a .813 winning percentage.
Johnson has also guided seven individual national champions in the last 12 seasons. In 2003, 165-pounder Matt Lackey joined Adam Tirapelle (149, 2001), John Lockhart (heavyweight, 2001), Carl Perry (141, 2000), Eric Siebert (150, 1998), Ernest Benion, Jr. (158, 1995) and Steve Marianetti (150, 1995) in earning NCAA titles under Johnson's tutelage at Illinois. He has brought 10 wrestlers to the NCAA Championships twice in his career (2006, 2000).
<p>
The 2005 season marked the first time under Johnson, and the first time in 53 years, that an Illinois team brought home the Big Ten Conference Tournament Championship trophy. For the second time in his career, Johnson was named Big Ten Coach of the Year, after leading his squad to numerous honors and breaking multiple school records. The team and coaching honors were capped off by two individual champions, Alex Tirapelle (157) and Pete Friedl (174), out of five total finalists for the Illini, the most in school history. For the second season in a row, the Illini won the Big Ten regular season dual meet title with a near-perfect 7-0-1 record. The team continued a streak of Top-10 finishes with its sixth place at the national championships after qualifying nine wrestlers, and 125-pounder Kyle Ott made a repeat appearance in the finals. The squad won its second team Midlands title, defending last year's which was the first in the school's history. The team matched last season's achievement of five All-Americans in Kyle Ott (2nd, 125), Mark Jayne (7th, 133), Cassio Pero (7th, 141), Pete Friedl (4th, 174) and Brian Glynn (3rd, 184).
<p>
The 2004 season was a year of firsts for Johnson. He led the team to a Big Ten regular season dual meet title and a Midlands Tournament team title, feats accomplished by no other coach in Illinois history. The squad capped the season with a seventh place finish at nationals, and Ott made the 125-pound finals match. This team brought home five All-Americans, a feat which tied 2004 National Champion Oklahoma State, and the most All-Americans in school history since 1948.
<p>
During the 2003 season, Johnson took eight qualifiers to the NCAA Championships from a squad that had five freshman competing most of the year. The 2003 team finished ninth overall with two national finalists. Senior Matt Lackey finished his climb up the ladder with his win in the finals over Troy Letters for his first national title. Freshman Tirapelle became the first Illinois freshman to make the finals as he ensured All-America honors with his second-place finish.
<p>
In 2002, during a rebuilding year, Johnson led a reshaped starting lineup to a 12-4 record and 10th-place finish at nationals. With seven new starters, the Illini still managed to qualify nine wrestlers for the NCAAs after a fifth-place finish at the Big Tens, equaling the 2001 squad's NCAA representation. That year, the Illini crowned three All-Americans, following two straight seasons of awarding four All-Americans.
The Illinois wrestling team has progressively made school history year after year. In 2000, the team's sixth-place national finish was the best since 1958 only to be topped by the 2001 finish of fifth place, which was the highest since 1948. The 2001 team also took second at the Big Ten Championships, sending nine athletes to the NCAA Championships and placing ahead of national power Iowa for the first time in Johnson's career. For his coaching efforts in 2001, Johnson was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year. The team posted a 12-2 dual meet record and Johnson became the school's all-time winningest coach.
<p>
In 1996-97, Johnson led his team to a 14-1 dual meet record, a third-place finish at the Big Ten Championships and a ninth-place effort at the NCAA Championships. At the time, his third-place finish was the best in school history in 39 years.
Johnson has guided 104 wrestlers to the NCAA championships over his tenure, an average of eight qualifiers each year. During the past 13 seasons, the Illini have crowned 38 All-Americans and produced seven national champions (out of 15 finalists).
Johnson earned National Coach of the Year honors from both the National Wrestling Coaches Association and W.I.N. Magazine in 1995 after posting a 13-2 dual record and a ninth-place finish at the NCAA championships.
<p>
On the recruiting front, Johnson has brought in eight classes ranked among the top 20 in the nation, including the second-ranked class in the nation in 1993 and sixth-ranked group last year.
<p>
Johnson came to Urbana-Champaign from Oregon State University, where he was head coach from 1990-1992. The Rock Island, Ill., native led the Beavers to the Pac-10 championship in 1992, earning conference Coach of the Year honors.
An alumnus of Alleman High School, Johnson was a high school national champion as a senior. He went on to the University of Michigan, where he was a two-time All-American and two-time NCAA runner-up at 177 pounds. Johnson captained the Wolverines and finished his college career with a 103-18-3 record. He earned a B.S. in education in 1977 and was a dean's list student.
<p>
Internationally, Johnson was a member of the 1980 Olympic team and was a member of 15 U.S. teams that competed throughout the world, winning two national championships.
<p>
Before moving to Oregon State, Johnson was University of Iowa head coach Dan Gable's top assistant for eight years. While at Iowa, he helped groom four NCAA championship teams, 17 national champions, 55 All-Americans and eight Big Ten championship squads. In 1986, he was named NWCA Assistant Coach of the Year.
Prior to accepting his Iowa position, Johnson was physical fitness director and wrestling coach at the Boys Club of Sarasota (Fla.) for two years.
<p>
Johnson began his coaching career at the University of Iowa, where he was a graduate assistant coach from 1978-80. Internationally, Johnson's coaching experience includes stints as assistant coach for the 1988 Olympic freestyle team and head coach at the 1986 and 1991 Olympic Sports Festivals. He is also a USA Wrestling National Coaching Staff member and a member of the Illinois Wrestling Hall of Fame.
<p>
Johnson and his wife, Linda, have two daughters, Tricia and Mackey, and reside in Champaign.

<h2>Johnson by the Numbers</h2>
<p>
It is impossible to ignore the success that Mark Johnson has had during his 14 years at Illinois. In 1993, he took over a program that had posted two winning seasons in 10 years and has since transformed Illinois into a national power, having posted 13 straight winning seasons and 11 Top-12 finishes.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Illinois won the 2005 Big Ten Championship for the first time since 1952.</li>
<li>Last season marked the third year in a row the Fighting Illini have brought home the Midlands Tournament team title. The Illini join Iowa and Iowa State as the only teams to accomplish the three-peat.</li>
<li>Johnson has led Illinois to 11 consecutive Top-12 finishes and nine Top-10 finishes in the last 12 years at the NCAA Wrestling Championships. </li>
<li>Matt Lackey became the seventh NCAA Champion for Johnson at Illinois when he won his title 2003. He joins Adam Tirapelle (2001), John Lockhart (2001), Carl Perry (2000), Eric Siebert (1998), Ernest Benion, Jr. (1995) and Steve Marianetti (1995).</li>
<li>In the last 15 years, Illinois has had 39 All-Americans, 22 of which came over the last six seasons. The five All-Americans in 2005 and 2004 ties the school record set in 1948.</li>
<li>Illinois has had 119 Big Ten placewinners during the Johnson era, including Big Ten Champions Alex Tirapelle and Pete Friedl in 2005 and Alex Tirapelle and Mark Jayne in 2004.</li>
<li>Over the last 15 years, UI has had an impressive 104 NCAA qualifiers, including 10 in 1995, 2000 and 2006, and nine in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2005. </li>
