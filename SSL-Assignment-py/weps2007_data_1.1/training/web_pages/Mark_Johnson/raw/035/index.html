<dl><dt> Teaching</a>
</dt><dd> This spring semester, Professor Johnson is teaching 
          <a href="http://math.aa.psu.edu/~mark/Math140/index.html">Math 140</a>, and
	  <a href="http://math.aa.psu.edu/~mark/Math311/index.html">Math 311</a>. 
         

</dd><dt> Office 
</dt><dd> Professor Johnson's office is 113 Hawthorn, which is in the first floor office wing.


</dd><dt> Contact Information
</dt><dd> The best way to contact Professor Johnson is via email,
	at <a href="mailto:mwj3@psu.edu">mwj3@psu.edu</a>.
	Alternatively, you could call his office at 
	(814) 949-5758 (simply extension 5758 from any campus phone).


</dd><dt> Office Hours
</dt><dd> Regular office hours will be held MWF 9-9:50 AM and Tu 10-10:50 AM.

	Students should consider these times as a standing
	appointment with the instructor and take advantage of this
	opportunity to have questions answered or to receive help with
	background difficulties.  Professor Johnson is also available at 
	certain other times by appointment, so if you cannot make any of these
	times, ask to meet him at another time. 

</dd><dt> <a href="http://math.aa.psu.edu/~mark/Advise/index.html">Academic Advising</a>
</dt><dd> This <a href="http://math.aa.psu.edu/~mark/Advise/index.html">advising page</a> is 
          intended as a starting point for Altoona students planning
	  to earn their degree from the Smeal College of Business.  


</dd><dt> Current Research
</dt><dd> Professor Johnson's research breaks down into several distinct 
          areas.  (Below are links to published articles.)

      <p> The first is related to Walhausen's K-theory with Wojciech Dorabiala 
          also of Penn State Altoona. 
	  <ul>
	   <li> <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.KT/0601620">Factoring the 
	        Becker-Gottlieb Transfer Through the Trace Map</a>. 
		Submitted for publication, January 2006.
	  </ul>

      <p>  Next is some ongoing work in Pi-algebras with David Blanc 
             of University of Haifa and James Turner of Calvin College.
	  <ul>
	   <li> A Tower of Fibrations to Compute Diagram Cohomology,
	       in progress.
	  </ul>

      <p>  Another current research interest is in computer science, specifically multi-agent protocols, 
            with Peter McBurney of the University of Liverpool and Simon Parsons of City 
	    University of New York. 
	   <ul>
	   <li> On illegal compositions and modeling multi-agent 
	         protocols, in preparation.
	   </ul> 

</dd><dt> Mathematics Publications
</dt><dd> Professor Johnson has published both mathematical articles and 
computer science articles, one of which appeared as a book chapter.
