"Too Sharp" Johnson</font></font></font></b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="markj1.jpg" BORDER=0 height=560 width=400 align=LEFT><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I
could hear the noise coming from Finley’s Boxing Club even before I got
to the door.&nbsp; As I walked up the steps, it all hit me – the heat,
the loud music, and the thick scent of men’s sweat.&nbsp; Just before I
chickened out of a once in a lifetime opportunity, I realized that the
music being played was from a Rare Essence PA tape.&nbsp; I immediately
felt right at home.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There he was, Mark "Too Sharp" Johnson,
punching the bag in the center of the room as four men surrounded him yelling.&nbsp;
Mark continued to hit hard as they reminded him, "Too Sharp!&nbsp; First
African-American flyweight champ!"</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I walked over and introduced myself to
a man sitting down and found that he was Jim Finley, owner of the boxing
club.&nbsp; He looked through the copy of the TMOTTGoGo I gave him while
telling me his feelings on Mark Johnson.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Mark is very popular.&nbsp; He carries
an entourage of fans wherever he goes, even to Las Vegas.&nbsp; He is definitely
the best in his weight class."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That’s an understatement compared to what
others say.&nbsp; Ask any boxing fan about Mark "Too Sharp" Johnson and
he or she will go one and on about how ‘baaad’ this man is.&nbsp; They’ll
tell you about how hard he hits and how great his style is.&nbsp; If they
live in D.C., they’ll tell you about how they went to the Armory on February
22 to see a fight, but only stayed a minute because Mark was entirely too
much for Arthur Johnson.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On this particular day, Mark is preparing
for his third fight this year.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I fought my number one contender in February,"
says Johnson.&nbsp; "That ended in 71 seconds.&nbsp; I just had a fight
July 26th, which was a tough 12 round fight.&nbsp; Now, I’m right back
after 35 days."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Not too many men can look cool when
they’re all sweaty and out of breath, but our hero looked too sharp.&nbsp;
As I sat and tried not to stare at Mark and the other buffed boxers, I
noticed Mr. Ham Johnson.&nbsp; He is Mark’s father, manager, and one of
the men who makes sure that Mark makes the most of his training.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Upon meeting him, one may mistake
him for being mean and then realize he’s just a man on a mission.&nbsp;
Ham and the rest of the Johnson camp are there to help Mark stay on top
of his game.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Chris Ray, the second chief trainer
broke it down for me from his perspective.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"Mark comes into his own…&nbsp; Mark
is a naturally gifted fighter.&nbsp; He’s watched a lot of films of old
fighters and really admired one of the greatest, Sugar Ray Robinson.&nbsp;
But, Mark is unique because he has his own style."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The date was Wednesday, September
2nd, just two days before Mark’s fight against Jose’ Laureano in Atlantic
City.&nbsp; The walls in Finley’s Gym are covered with pictures of boxers,
all shapes, sizes and shades.&nbsp; While I was checking out the boxers
in the pictures, Mr. Finley told me to peep the many signs strategically
posted around the gym.&nbsp; These signs, written by Mr. Finley himself,
are words of encouragement, advice, and rules of the club.&nbsp; One sign
tells club members that they can bring in their video tapes to share with
others as long as they don’t brag about their wins or complain about their
losses (i.e. "I slipped," "I was tired," etc.).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;You won’t hear Mark Johnson making
excuses for talking an ‘L’.&nbsp; He doesn’t even brag about how good he
is, and he doesn’t have to.&nbsp; The record speaks for itself.&nbsp; He
has won 35 consecutive fights and is now 36-1 as a professional.&nbsp;
When he fought Luis Rolon in July, he defended his IBF flyweight title
by winning every round on all three judges’ cards.&nbsp; When asked about
his predictions for the September 4th fight, Johnson had a very positive
outlook.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"I’m very focused for this fight.&nbsp;
I got criticized for my last fight because I bruised both of my knuckles
and I tended to plan more than fight.&nbsp; I want to let people know that
the thing for me is getting the ‘W’.&nbsp; If this guy’s a great opponent,
it’ll be a boring fight.&nbsp; I want everybody to know that I’m ready
and I’m bringing it home."</font>
<p><img SRC="markj2.jpg" BORDER=0 height=311 width=386 align=RIGHT><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Watching
Mark "Too Sharp" Johnson train is almost as exciting as watching the Southwest,
D.C. native stagger his opponents in the ring.&nbsp; I saw Mark work out
on the punching bag and also practice in the small ring in back of the
gym.&nbsp; After every segment of the workout routine, trainers would pour
water over him before be began the next one.&nbsp; The most amazing thing
was when he stretched out on his back and kept a straight face while a
trainer bounced a medicine ball on his stomach over and over.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"My style changes in the ring according
to how my opponent fight," explains Mark.&nbsp; "But, I prepare for each
fight the same way.&nbsp; Preparation is getting up in&nbsp; the morning,
coming to the gym, roadwork, getting a good night’s rest, and most important,
no sexual activity.&nbsp; Preparation is the hardest thing.&nbsp; The fight
is the easiest."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I’m not sure which was more fun
to watch:&nbsp; Mark Johnson jumping rope in front of me with water glistening
all over his body, or Mark Johnson bobbing his head to Rare Essence’s "Go
Down Baby, Go Down" in between sets of sit-ups.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Chris Ray, a former amateur boxer,
explained to me as I watched, "You can’t have the same style fighting different
opponents because someone is always studying you and watching your tape."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Before he retires from boxing, Mark
wants to fight Johnny Tapia and move up in his weight class.&nbsp; He’s
currently fighting 112 pounds, but has set a goal to fight 115.&nbsp; The
retirement date is set for April, and he will be 27 years old.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"If&nbsp; the Johnny Tapia fight
doesn’t happen before April, I’ve got major decisions to make.&nbsp; Money
is not the aspect.&nbsp; It’s my health.&nbsp; Right now, I’m in great
shape and I plan to stay that way.&nbsp; I made the decision (to retire)
based upon other fighters who have gotten hurt, who have slurred speech
or walk differently.&nbsp; I’m trying to get myself financially set so
I don’t have to resort back to fighting."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Mark Johnson is very intelligent
and goal oriented.&nbsp; A conversation with him can put to rest any stereotypes
one may have about boxers or young black men, period.&nbsp; He owns a beauty
salon and a barbershop located on South Capitol Street in Southwest, D.C.&nbsp;
He has accomplished so much for someone his age, yet he has his life in
perspective and doesn’t carry himself as if he’s all about the ‘benjamins.’</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"I want to go back to school," states
Mark.&nbsp; I want to get my degree so I’ll have something to fall back
on.&nbsp; Even if my businesses don’t do well, I will always have a degree
where I can go get a 9 to 5.&nbsp; The game has been too good to me.&nbsp;
I have a $200,000 home, two Mercedes, and Expedition, but those are material
things.&nbsp; The main thing is just getting out of the game in good health."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Mark is thankful for his wife and
four children.&nbsp; He feels that they are very important to him and enjoys
giving them the finer things in life.&nbsp; He continues to keep his priorities
in order despite negative energy from people who try to bring him down
with counter-productive actions and comments.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"Any fight is tough because&nbsp;
people will call and want tickets to the fight and afterparty, plus a hotel
room.&nbsp; I have to try to block it all out."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Mark Johnson defeated Jose Laureano
in Atlantic City on Friday, September 4, 1998.&nbsp; As a business owner
and the first African-American IBF Flyweight title holder, he is the epitome
of what we should all be striving for.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"I want to show people that you don’t
have to make millions of dollars.&nbsp; You’ve got guys that have made
trillions of dollars, but don’t have anything today.&nbsp; I make $150,000
each fight, but I want to show you that a little bit of money can go a
long way."</font>
