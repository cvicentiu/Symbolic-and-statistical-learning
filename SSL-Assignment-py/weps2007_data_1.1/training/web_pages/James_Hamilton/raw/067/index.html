the Bruce after the Battle of Bannockburn and was granted the Royal Barony
of Cadzow. A Hamilton was heir to the Scottish throne and arranged the marriage
between Mary Queen of Scots and the Dauphin of France. A Hamilton was proposed
as husband for Queen Elizabeth of England--and proposed himself as husband
for Queen Mary--but was judged insane. Hamiltons were lords, earls, marquesses,
and dukes--wise and foolish--generous and greedy--killed in duels and battles
and executed by hanging and decapitation.</BIG></FONT>

<P>
The Hamiltons who held Hambleton in Leicestershire and were later granted
the Royal Barony of Cadzow probably immigrated to England from the Seine
Valley in France, which they may have entered from Hainault in the south
of present-day Belgium.
<P>
The earliest recorded Hamilton is <B>Gilbert de Hameldun</B>, a witness to
a charter confirming the gift of the church at Cragyn to the Abbey of Paisley
in 1271. According to one legend, Sir Hamilton expressed admiration for
<B>Robert the Bruce</B> at the court of <B>King Edward II </B>in about 1323,
upon which he was struck by <B>John de Spencer</B> (or one Dispenser). A
duel followed and de Spencer fell. (Alternatively, de Spencer may have refused
to fight and Hamilton killed him.) Hamilton fled towards Scotland, hotly
pursued. Near the border, he and his esquire donned the dress of woodcutters
and began working. As the soldiers passed, his esquire hesitated and, to
divert attention, Hamilton called out "Throu," the traditional woodcutters'
exclamation. &nbsp;They were not recognized, and Hamilton's life was saved.
The <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~hamiltonclan/arms.htm">Hamilton Coat of Arms</A> commemorates this escape.
<P>
The son of Gilbert by Isabel was Sir <B>Walter Fitz Gilbert de Hamildon</B>
(variously spelled Homildon, Hamildon, Hameldone, or Hambleton), an English
knight who owned properties in Renfrewshire. The first recording of his name
was as <B><I>Walterus filius Gilberti</I> </B>in 1294, when he witnessed
a Stewart charter granting the monastery of Paisley the right to fish for
herring in the River Clyde. Fitz Gilbert swore loyalty to <B>King Edward
I </B>in 1292 and again in 1296 for his estates in Lanarkshire and other
counties and was Governor of Bothwell Castle for England during the early
part of the Scottish Wars of Independence. After the Battle of Bannockburn
in 1314--during which thirty thousand Scotsmen commanded by Bruce defeated
100,000 Englishmen led by Edward II and captured Stirling Castle--Walter
Fitz Gilbert surrendered Bothwell Castle to <B>Robert the Bruce </B>. In
appreciation of this support, Bruce knighted him and awarded him forfeited
Comyn lands, including the properties of Cadzow in Lanarkshire. Here, in
the area later named <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~hamiltonclan/hamiltown.htm">Hamilton</A>, Fitz Gilbert built
Cadzow Castle, and here his descendants would built magnificent Hamilton
Palace and later Chatelherault. Fitz Gilbert first married <B>Helen</B> and
then <B>Mary</B>, daughter of Sir <B>Adam Gordon of Gordon</B>, a union that
produced his heir, Sir <B>David Fitz Walter Fitz Gilbert</B>, and <B>John
Fitz Walter</B>.
<P>
At the Battle of Neville's Cross (also called the Battle of Durham) in 1346,
the English captured Sir David, together with his namesake, David II, son
of Robert the Bruce. Hamilton was released following payment of a handsome
ransom. He married <B>Margaret</B>, daughter of <B>William de Ross</B>, and
was succeeded by their eldest son, Sir <B>David Fitz David Fitz Walter Fitz
Gilbert de Hamyldon</B>, Baron of Cadzow, who received additional grants
of land from the King in 1375 and 1378. His eldest son, Sir <B>John Hamilton
of Cadzow</B>, witness to a charter in 1392, was twice prisoner in England.
He married <B>Janet (Jacoba)</B>, daughter of <B>Sir James Douglas</B>, and
was succeeded by their eldest son, Sir <B>James Hamilton of Cadzow</B>, who
visited England as a prisoner in 1424 and 1426 as a hostage for the ransom
of <B>King James I </B>from his English captivity.
<P>
Sir <B>James Hamilton of Cadzow</B>, the eldest son of James Hamilton and
his wife <B>Janet</B>, daughter of Sir <B>Alexander Livingston</B>, was created
a hereditary lord of parliament in 1445 and thereafter known as <I><B>Lord
Hamilton</B></I>. Noted for his energy and wisdom, his opinions were highly
valued in the national council and among his fellow barons. He surrendered
all his lands and baronies for creation into a new lordship of Hamilton,
the name decreed for the town of Cadzow by Royal Charter in 1445. Although
Hamilton joined the confederacy which Douglas formed with the Earls of Crawford
and Ross against the Crown, he subsequently changed his loyalty to <B>King
James II </B>and helped suppress the revolt. For this he was rewarded with
the office of Sheriff of Lanarkshire in 1455 and granted a new charter for
his lands and baronies. His first wife, <B>Euphemia</B>, widow of the <B>5th
Earl of Douglas</B>, died in 1468. In 1474, he married <B>Princess Mary
Stewart</B>, daughter of King James II, sister of <B>James III</B>, and widow
of <B>Thomas Boyd</B>, <B><I>Earl of Arran </I></B>(a Gaelic-speaking island
in the Forth of Clyde).
<P>
From this union was born in about 1475 <B>James</B>, <I><B>2nd Lord
Hamilton.</B></I> In 1490, at age 15, he married <B>Elizabeth</B>, the
13-year-old widow of <B>Thomas Hay of Hoprew</B>, Master of Yester, but is
thought to have divorced her the following year on the grounds that the Master
was actually alive.<I> </I>Sir James assisted with the arrangements for the
marriage of his cousin <B>James IV</B> to <B>Princess Margaret Tudor of
England</B>. As a reward, James IV granted him the <I><B>Earldom of
Arran</B></I> and Brodick Castle on his wedding day in August 1503. James
was appointed Admiral of the Scottish Fleet in 1513, Lord of Regency under
the Duke of Albany in 1517, and he commanded the Royal army against the Earl
of Lennox in 1526. He married<B> Janet</B>, widow of Sir <B>Robert
Livingston</B>, in 1516.
<P>
Constantly feuding with the Douglases, represented by the Earl of Angus,
the second husband of Queen Margaret, James was involved in the infamous
"Clear the Causeway" skirmish, which occurred in the High Street of Edinburgh
in 1520. The Hamiltons, who initiated the contest, were defeated and several
of their chiefs and 70 of their men were killed. Arran escaped with difficulty
through the North Loch.
<P>
One of the 7 known illegitimate children of James was Sir <B>James Hamilton
of Finnart</B>, who was known for his considerable energy and was the principal
architect of Scotland at that time. Sir James married <B>Margaret
Livingston</B>, daughter of his father's new wife, and administered her lands
to considerable personal advantage. <B>King James V </B>appointed him Cup-bearer
and Steward of the Royal Household and Master of Works to the King. Under
his supervision, the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Blackness and the
palace of Holyrood were enlarged and adorned. In appreciation of Hamilton's
merits, the King bestowed on him several valuable estates, including the
lands of Draphen in Lanarkshire. Here Sir James erected the formidable and
stately castle of Craignethan. Sir James, however, had a passionate temper.
He was the main instigator of the "Clear the Causeway" skirmish. More
significantly, he murdered <B>John Stuart</B>, <B><I>12th Earl of
Lennox</I></B>,&nbsp;and participated in the persecution of the Protestants,
including his cousin <B>Patrick Hamilton</B>, who was burnt at the stake
in 1528. &nbsp;Accused of treason and embezzlement, he was found guilty and
beheaded in 1540.
<P>
<B>John Hamilton</B>, Abbot of Paisley, Archbishop of St. Andrews and Primate
of All Scotland, and also an illegitimate son of the Earl (legitimized in
1546), attempted to reform the Catholic Church and issued an English catechism.
He was the principal opponent of John Knox after the murder of Cardinal Beaton.
He baptized Queen Mary's son, the future King James VI, in 1566 and remained
loyal to the Queen. However, for alleged complicity in the murders of <B>Lord
Darnley </B>and the <B>Regent Murray </B>(the Queen's brother), Archbishop
Hamilton was hanged, wearing his episcopal vestments, from the Bridge at
Stirling in 1571 on the orders of the <B>Regent Lennox</B>.
<P>
<B>James Hamilton</B>, <B><I>2nd Earl of Arran</I></B>, son of the first
Earl by his second wife, was chosen Regent of the Kingdom and Guardian of
little<B> Queen Mary </B>following the death of King James V and declared
Heir Presumptive to the Crown in 1542 or 1543. In this capacity, James reportedly
tried to arrange the marriage of Queen Mary to his son in order to secure
the throne for his family. Ultimately, James arranged for the marriage of
Mary to the <B>Prince of France</B>, the <B>Dauphin</B>, for which he was
rewarded by the French <B>King Henry II</B> in 1548 or 1549 with the French
<B><I>Dukedom of Chatelherault </I></B>in Poitou. Characterized by feebleness
and fickleness, he vacillated between Catholicism and the Reformed church.
Following the death of the Dauphin (then <B>King Francis II</B>), James openly
opposed the marriage of the Queen to <B>Henry Stuart </B>(known to the English
as <B>Lord Darnley</B>) and, as a consequence, was compelled to leave Scotland
for 4 or 5 years. Mary would later wed her third husband, the <B>Earl of
Bothwell</B>, the alleged mastermind behind the assassination of her second
husband Lord Darnley. This scandal led to Mary's imprisonment at the island
fortress on Loch Leven, where she&nbsp;was forced to abdicate. Upon James'
return to Scotland, he remained close to Mary and hid her (and reportedly
the crown jewels) at Cadzow Castle after she escaped from Loch Leven. Although
James attempted to regain power, he was forced to submit to the authority
of the Regent Murray, who imprisoned him at the Castle of Edinburgh. Here
he helped plan the murder of the "Good Regent."
<P>
In 1575, James was succeeded by his eldest son <B>James</B>, <B><I>3rd Earl
of Arran</I></B>, Commander of the Scots Guards in France, who was proposed
by the Lords of the Congregation as husband for <B>Queen Elizabeth of England
</B>in 1560, and who proposed himself as husband for Mary, Queen of Scots,
in 1561. He was judged insane in 1562, although it may be that he was only
scatterbrained. James resigned the Earldom of Arran to <B>James Stewart </B>of
Bothwelhaugh in 1581, but this was ruled by the Court of Session in 1586
to be "the act of a person incompetent in consequence of insanity," whereupon
his honors were restored. His brother <B>John</B>, <B><I>4th Earl of Arran
</I></B>and <B><I>3rd Duke of Chatelherault</I></B>, administered the estates
and was given the Abbey of Arbroath in 1551. He became Chancellor of Scotland
and Keeper of the castles at Sterling and Edinburgh and is the ancestor of
the <B><I>Dukes of Hamilton</I></B>.

<P>
John was significantly influenced by his younger brother <B>Claud</B>. Although
initially hostile to Mary, they later became devoted partisans. Claud escorted
Mary to Hamilton Palace after her escape from Loch Leven and commanded Mary's
vanguard in the Battle of Langslide in 1568. <B>Lord Claud Hamilton</B> was
created a peer by King James VI and received from him a grant of the Barony
of Paisley, followed by the gift of the rich Abbey of Paisley. He was created
<B><I>Lord Paisley </I></B>on July 29, 1587, and is the ancestor of the
<I><B>Dukes of Abercorn </B></I>(see below).
<P>
At the Pacification of Perth in 1573, the Hamiltons abandoned Mary's cause.
A reconciliation with the Douglases was effected by the marriage of Lord
John to <B>Margaret</B>, daughter of the <B>7th Lord Glamis</B>, a cousin
of the Regent Morton. However, in 1579, proceedings against the Hamiltons
were resumed for the deaths of Regent Murray and Regent Lennox, who had been
murdered in 1571. John and members of his family fled or were exiled to England,
after which their titles and lands were seized by their opponents, and <B>James
Stuart </B>became Earl of Arran. Claud sought intervention from Spain on
behalf of Mary. John dissociated himself from the plot and returned to Scotland,
where he formally reconciled with <B>James VI</B>, leading to restoration
of the honors and estates of the family 1585. Claud returned the following
year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord John became a favorite of King James VI, who created
him <B><I>1st Marquess of Hamilton</I></B> and <B><I>Lord Evan</I></B> in
1599.
<P>
His son <B>John</B>, <B><I>2nd Marquess of Hamilton</I></B>, died at Whitehall
at the age of 36, reportedly poisoned by the Duke of Buckingham. &nbsp;
<P>
<B>James Hamilton</B>, <B><I>3rd Marquess</I></B> and <B><I>1st Duke of
Hamilton</I></B>, was appointed by <B>King Charles I </B>to command the fleet
he sent against the Scottish Covenanters in 1639. On this occasion, the mother
of the Marquess--a zealous Covenanter--appeared among the volunteers and
pronounced that she would &nbsp;be the first to shoot her son if he should
land and attack his countrymen. It was the Marquess, as High Commissioner,
that Charles I entrusted with the task of convincing the Covenanters to abandon
their League and Covenant in favor of supporting him in his contest with
the English Parliament. &nbsp;Not only was Hamilton unable to dissuade the
Covenanters to abandon their plan to replace the Episcopalian system with
Presbyterianism, but the Covenanters sent an army to support those opposed
to the King. Charles was so angered by the Marquess' ineptness that he
incarcerated him at Pendennis Castle in Cornwall and later at St. Michael's
Mount, where he remained until 1646. Upon his release from prison, James
learned that <B>Cromwell </B>had imprisoned Charles. Apparently harboring
no hostility over his recent imprisonment, he raised a Scottish army of 14,000
quickly recruited and poorly trained troops and marched into England with
the purpose of restoring Charles as King. Instead, they were defeated by
Cromwell's forces, and the Duke surrendered his army at Preston in 1648.
Tried as Earl of Cambridge and an English subject on the charge of levying
war against the English people, he was found guilty and beheaded in 1649,
one month after King Charles.
<P>
James was succeeded by his brother <B>William Hamilton</B>, <B><I>Earl of
Lanark</I></B>, <B><I>2nd Duke of Hamilton</I></B>, and <B><I>4th Marquess
of Hamilton</I></B>, who with equal misfortune supported the Royal cause.
Reputedly honest and intelligent, in contrast to his predecessors, he accompanied
<B>Charles II </B>to Scotland in 1650 and joined the march into England,
where he was mortally wounded at age 34 at the Battle of Worcester.
<P>
Neither James nor William left any male heirs, so the titles and estates
of the family were transferred to <B>Duchess Anne</B>, the daughter of the
1st Duke. She married Lord <B>William Douglas</B>, who, at the restoration
of the monarchy, was created <B><I>Duke of Hamilton</I></B> for the duration
of his life. King James appointed him a privy counsellor and a Commissioner
of the Treasury. However, he refused to support the dispensing power claimed
by the King, and, upon the arrival of the <B>Prince of Orange</B>, he headed
the delegation of Scottish noblemen and gentlemen who waited upon William
at Whitehall. He was selected to be the leader of the Whig party and, after
a keen contest, was elected President of the Convention at Edinburgh in 1689.
The Convention declared that James had forfeited the throne, and, after the
Convention was formed into a Parliament, Hamilton was appointed President
of the Council and Lord High Admiral of Scotland and, in 1693, Lord High
Commissioner to the Parliament.
<P>
William died in 1694 and was succeeded by his eldest son, <B>James</B>,
<B><I>4th Duke of Hamilton</I></B>, who was born in 1658. Educated at the
University of Glasgow, James was appointed one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber
of Charles II in 1679. He was nominated Ambassador Extraordinary to France
in 1683 and served in two campaigns as aide-de-camp to the French King Louis
XIV. Following the death of Charles II in 1685, <B>King James</B> appointed
the Duke (then called <B><I>Earl of Arran</I></B>) Master of the Wardrobe
and commander of the Royal Regiment of Horse.
<P>
During the Revolution, the Hamiltons had hedged their bets. Arran supported
the restoration of the Stewart family and was twice confined to the Tower
on suspicion of treason. On the other hand, his father, the Duke, supported
the claims of <B>King William</B>, so that regardless of the outcome, the
family titles and estates would be retained. However, on the death of the
Duke in 1694, Arran received neither accession of title nor estate, since
both were possessed by his mother. In 1698, the Duchess resigned the family
dignities to King William, who then conferred them on Arran. &nbsp;He was
created a British peer in 1711 by the titles of <B><I>Duke of Brandon</I></B>
and <B><I>Baron Dutton</I></B>. The following year Duke James was appointed
Master-General of the Ordnance and received the Order of the Garter in addition
to the Order of the Thistle, which had been conferred on him by King James.
He was killed in 1712 in a duel with the notorious <B>Lord Mohun</B> (whom
he mortally wounded).
<P>
Fulfilling the "Grand Design" of <B>Anne</B>, <B><I>3rd Duchess of
Hamilton</I></B>, for the lands surrounding Hamilton Palace, <B>James</B>,
<B><I>5th Duke of Hamilton</I></B>, commissioned the well-known architect
<B>William Adam</B> to design a hunting lodge for the estate. A site was
selected on a hill adjacent to the medieval hunting forest near 12th century
Cadzow Castle, and construction was started in 1732. Adam referred to it
as the "dog kennels of Hamilton," and part of the building was in fact used
for kennels and stables. Hamilton called it
<A HREF="http://home.att.net/~hamiltonclan/chatelherault.htm">Chatelherault</A>, after the dukedom.
<P>
The <B><I>10th Duke of Hamilton</I></B>, <B>Alexander</B>, "Il Magnifico,"
was Ambassador to Russia. He completed the enlargements at Hamilton Palace
and filled it with priceless art and furniture . He demolished the old medieval
collegiate church, except for a transept that was the Hamilton family burial
vault, and initiated the construction of the <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~hamiltonclan/mausoleum.htm">Hamilton
Mausoleum</A>, where he reinterred the Hamilton ancestors--which he considered
to be the royal family of Scotland.
<P>
In 1845, his son <B>William Alexander Anthony Archibald</B>, the <B><I>11th
Duke of Hamilton</I></B> and <B><I>8th Duke of Brandon</I></B>, married
<B>Princess Marie of Baden</B>. She was the daughter of a cousin of <B>Napoleon
III</B>, from whom Hamilton obtained recognition of his right to the title
Duke of Chatelherault, conferred on the Regent Arran in 1548. Duke William
died in 1863 at the age of 52 after falling down the stairs of a hotel in
Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P>
He was succeeded by <B>William Alexander Louis Stephen</B>, <B><I>12th Duke
of Hamilton</I></B>, who was born in 1845. When he came of age, it was said
that there are few positions in life more influential and more desirable
than that which is occupied by the youthful heir of the house of Hamilton.
The head of the most illustrious of our historic families, whose origin is
hid in the mists of antiquity, and whose deeds are interwoven with the most
momentous events in the history of our country; the possessor of the highest
rank and of titles unrivalled as regards both their number and their renown--a
triple dukedom, a triple marquisate, four earldoms, and seven baronies; premier
peer of Scotland, male heir of the 'doughty Douglases,' the representative
in the female line of the 'princely Hamiltons'--at one time the heirs, after
the Stewarts, to the Scottish crown--owner of their vast estates extending
over four counties, situated for the most part in the richest districts of
the kingdom, and yielding a rental of 157,602 pounds a year.
<P>
<B>Angus Douglas Hamilton</B>, the <B><I>15th Duke of Hamilton</I></B>, is
currently the Premier Duke of Scotland and Hereditary Keeper of the Palace
of Holyroodhouse.

<P>
The <B><I>Duke of Abercorn</I></B> is the head of perhaps the most influential
branch of the ducal family. Its founder, <B>Lord Claud Hamilton</B>, son
of the 2nd Earl of Arran and Duke of Chatelherault, received from James VI
the Barony of Paisley, from which he derived his title of Baron Paisley,
as noted previously.
<P>
Lord Paisley was succeeded by his eldest son <B>James Hamilton</B>, who was
created the <B><I>Earl of Abercorn</I></B> by King James. In 1634, <B>Claud
Hamilton</B>, a younger brother of the Earl, was created <B><I>Lord
Hamilton</I></B> and, in the peerage of Ireland, <B><I>Baron of Strabane
</I></B>by Charles I. Claud, the <B><I>4th Earl of Abercorn</I></B>, supported
James after the Revolution in 1688 and accompanied him when he went from
France to Ireland. After the defeat of James at the battle of the Boyne,
the Earl departed with him to France but lost his life during the voyage.
He was attainted and his estates were forfeited for his adherence to the
Jacobite cause. However, his brother, <B>Charles</B>, who succeeded him in
his Earldom, obtained a reversal of the attainder. On his death the titles
and estates passed to Captain <B>James Hamilton</B>, who abandoned the cause
of King James when it became apparent that it would lose. He was created
<B><I>Baron Mountcastle</I></B> and <B><I>Viscount Strabane</I></B>, and
lucrative offices--civil, military, and ecclesiastical--were bestowed upon
his family.
<P>
The <B>Heir Male</B> of the Hamiltons is <B>James Hamilton</B>, <B><I>5th
Duke of Abercorn</I></B> in the peerage of Ireland, <B><I>6th Marquess of
Abercorn </I></B>in the peerage of Great Britain, and <B><I>14th Earl of
Abercorn</I></B> in the peerage of Scotland. He was born in 1934 and married
<B>Alexandra Anastasia</B> in 1966. They have two sons, <B>James Harold Charles
Hamilton</B>, <B><I>Viscount Strabane</I></B>, and <B>Lord Nicholas Edward
Claud Hamilton</B>, and one daughter, <B>Lady Sophia Alexandra Hamilton</B>.
