<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">SLOWLY RECOVERING</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We praise our Lord for His 
goodness in every situation. His constant presence is a blessing for us, and we 
rejoice in the many blessings that He provides. Without Him, we could not make 
it through the challenges we face in this life. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I am happy to be recovering from 
the surgery I endured in December. Progress is slow but sure.&nbsp; I still must be 
very careful so that I will not have a setback. I feel so well that it is easy 
to forget to take it easy sometimes. I thank the Lord that I do feel well. In 
February, I made my first trip since my operation. With the Lord's help, I was 
able to go without any problems or complications. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">CONSTANTA</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The best news is that Doru has 
returned from his job in the Bahamas. He continually is growing stronger as a 
Christian. His attitude is an excellent example for everyone, but especially for 
the other members who live in the same place he does. We have frequent 
individual studies, and his increase in knowledge is remarkable. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We are still dealing with 
several problems with various members. We are various stages of corrective 
discipline with several members. The majority do not attend as they should, and 
we are trying to encourage them to be more faithful to the Lord in this respect 
and in other ways, too. We rejoice that Florin expressed a desire to repent and 
return to serve the Lord more faithfully, but he has not brought fruit 
demonstrating repentance. We are also making an effort to win Georgeta back. She 
is confused about many things and has not been attending with us for a while. 
Other members, as well as I, are involved in trying to restore the unfaithful. 
The success of the church does not depend on the absence of problems as much as 
our reaction to the problems and how we work to solve them. In particular, I 
have seen spiritual growth in George and Rodica because of our working together 
to solve problems in the church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One thing I do regret about the 
last couple of years is that I had to spend more time and energy on internal 
problems than I did on evangelism. But I realize it would be vain to work to 
invite people to a group with many unresolved issues. It hurts our ability to 
evangelize (John 13:34-35). God, who gives the increase (1 Cor. 3:7), will not 
put newborn babes in a contaminated spiritual incubator. God, in His wisdom and 
time, will give the increase when He knows we are ready.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Beginning in January, the men 
have been meeting every Tuesday. We discuss plans for the church and discuss 
problems in dealing with members. We are also using this time to prepare for 
evangelism and other spiritual development. This has been very good for us. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">TRIP TO PIATRA NEAMT</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Iulian and I went to Piatra 
Neamt recently. It was a very encouraging trip for both of us. He had some 
personal business to attend to, and we met with Cornel. Cornel is doing better 
spiritually in comparison to the last time I saw him. The sad news is that he is 
leaving this week to work in Italy again. We had a study with Constanta and 
Stefan. Their mother has left again. Iulian told me that seeing the the Rusus' 
faith and attitude in the face of their difficult living conditions was an 
encouraging example for him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">TRIP TO WESTERN ROMANIA</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was necessary for me to go to 
Drobeta Turnu Severin in February. I put off this trip as long as possible 
because of my recovery. I had a chance to spend time in Timisoara that week with 
Nelu Stanciulescu. He is a good man who has worked well for the Lord in 
Timisoara. In the little time I saw him last year, I was impressed with him. My 
appreciation for him and his efforts increases with each visit. I was able to 
participate in a group study with several men on Wednesday and see a large 
number of the members</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Wednesday evening. Several were 
recent converts, and these new Christians are working to teach others or 
inviting others to study with Nelu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On Thursday, I had the chance to 
be with the brethren living in Drobeta Turnu Severin. Because of the harsh 
winter weather and problems with their heating, they met in the children's 
classroom. The room was full, and the participation was good. I stayed with Ion 
Corlan during my stay there. He is doing a good work there with Nicolae Carnaru. 
Nicolae was not there because his father passed away unexpectedly that week. Ion 
has obviously grown much since I first met him at a Bible conference in 
Timisoara in 1998.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Ion and I went to several places 
to inquire about a suitable location for a Bible conference in July. This will 
be a conference similar to the one that where I met Ion in 1998. I selected 
Drobeta Turnu Severin for two reasons. This small city is located halfway 
between Bucharest and Timisoara. Numerous Christians also live in the vicinity, 
and they can commute each day. We found a hotel we can stay in and meet each 
day. I have invited Frank Jamerson, Buddy Payne, and Doug Seaton to deliver 
lectures each day. The brethren coming from the Southwest congregation: Greg 
Gravitz, Carrie Black, and Jenny Reed, will be involved with afternoon classes 
for the women and the young people. Marilyn Payne will also lead some of the 
women's activities. All the activities and lectures will involve the Christian 
and his behavior in various relationships in this life. Everyone is looking 
forward to it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">FELLOW WORKERS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Thank you to everyone who has 
helped us with the extra expenses we had. The Lord has provided through you all 
that we needed. Brethren from the Spring Warrior church in Perry, FL and 
Trenton, FL gave one-time help in addition to their monthly support. So did the 
Woodland Hills church in Nashville, TN and Prince St. in Conway, AR. The 
brethren from Columbus, OH sent special one-time help that will help us with our 
traveling expenses.&nbsp; Thanks also to all of you who have been praying for us in 
our special time of need. You are fellow workers with us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I have also been blessed with 
the assurance of regular support from the Rose Ave. church in Bellflower, CA and 
an increase in faithful support from the church in Trenton, FL. This helps to 
counteract the huge decrease of the dollar's value against the Romanian 
currency. The dollar has been weak against the euro for two years, but even the 
euro has dropped 15% in Romania within the last few months. We are thankful for 
the beginning of the working relationship with the Rose Ave. church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If the Lord wills, I plan to see 
every church regularly supporting me during my trip to the States this spring. 
If the Lord wills, I will leave on April 19 and return on May 25. The brethren 
in Constanta have planned for a chain of men to work here in my absence. Brent 
Forsyth will bring Jeff Carr with him and stay for about two weeks, followed by 
Dave Girardot, who will be followed by Alan Williamson and his son Adam. We 
appreciate their willingness to come and help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We pray that your labors in the 
Lord will result in God giving the increase. May He also bless you with peace, 
health, wisdom and strength in Him. Please continue to pray for us. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">James</p>
