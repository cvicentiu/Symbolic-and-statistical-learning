<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>b. c. 1815, probably Montgomery
County, Md., U.S.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>d. Oct. 1, 1864, near Wilmington,
N.C.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>3) Born in 1817 in rural Montgomery
County, Maryland, Rose O'Neal came from a family of limited financial resources
and little education. Far more so than was the case with Boyd, however,
O'Neal's humble beginnings failed to inhibit her climb up the social ladder.
As a teenager Rose O'Neal traveled with her sister Ellen Elizabeth to Washington,
D.C., where they stayed with an aunt who maintained a boardinghouse in
the Old Capitol building (later, ironically, to become the Old Capitol
Prison). There, the attractive young sisters had the opportunity to associate
with a number of their aunt's male boarders, many of them up-and-coming
politicians, and Rose in particular developed a taste for living an active
social life and rubbing shoulders with people in power.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Some years later, when, at the age
of twenty-six, she married forty-three-year-old Dr. Robert Greenhow, Rose
O'Neal demonstrated her determination to leave behind what she considered
the dull country life of her childhood. Dr. Greenhow, a Virginian, was
both wealthy and socially well placed; marriage to him promised Rose continued
access to the sort of world to which earlier visits to her aunt's boardinghouse
had accustomed her.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Indeed, by the time she was in her
mid-thirties, the mother of four daughters, and living with her husband
and family in the nation's capital, Rose O'Neal Greenhow had not only established
strong connections with the Washington political elite but had herself
become a person of significant social influence and cunning.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>

<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>The Funeral of Mrs. Rose Greenhow
-- The death by drowning of Mrs. Rose Greenhow, near Wilmington, North
Carolina, last week, has been already noticed. She leaves one child, an
interesting little daughter, who is in a convent school at Paris, where
her mother left her upon her return to this country. Hundreds of ladies
lined the wharf at Wilmington upon the approach of the steamer bearing
Mrs. Greenhow's remains. The Soldiers' Aid Society took charge of the funeral
which took place from the chapel of Hospital No. 4.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>A letter to the Sentinel, describing
it, says:</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>"It was a solemn and imposing spectacle.
The profusion of wax lights round the corpse, the quality of choice flowers,
in crosses, garlands, and bouquets, scattered over it, the silent mourners,
sable-robed at the head and foot; the tide of visitors, women and children,
with streaming eyes, and soldiers, with bent heads and hushed steps, standing
by, paying the last tribute of respect to the departed heroine. On the
bier, draped with a magnificent Confederate flag, lay the body , so unchanged
as to look like a calm sleeper, while above all rose the tall ebony crucifix
-- emblem of the faith she embraced in happier hours, and which we humbly
trust, was her consolation in passing through the dark waters of the river
of death.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>She lay there until two o'clock
of Sunday afternoon, when the body was removed to the Catholic Church of
St. Thomas. Here the funeral oration was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Corcoran,
which was a touching tribute to the heroism and patriotic devotion of the
deceased, as well as a solemn warning, on the uncertainty of all human
projects and ambition, even though of the most laudable character.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>"The coffin, which was as richly
decorated as the resources of the town admitted, and still covered with
the Confederate flag, was borne to the Oakdale Cemetery, followed by an
immense funeral cortege. A beautiful spot on a grassy slope , overshadowed
by wavering trees and in sight of a tranquil lake, was chosen for her resting
place. Rain fell in torrents during the day; but as the coffin was being
lowered into the grave, the sun burst forth in the brightest majesty, and
a rainbow of the most vivid color spanned the horizon. Let us accept the
omen, not only for her, the quiet sleeper, who, after many storms and a
tumultuous and checkered life, came to peace and rest at last, but also
for our beloved country, over which we trust the rainbow of hope will ere
long shine with brightest dyes.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>"The pall bearers were Colonel Tansill,
chief of staff to General Whiting; Major Vanderhorst, J.M. Seixas, Esq.,
Dr. de Prossett, Dr. Micks and Dr. Medway. General Whiting and Captain
C. B. Poindexter, representing the two services, were prevented from acting
as pallbearers, the former by reason of absence, the latter in consequence
of illness."</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>6) I just finished looking through
the book "My imprisonment and the First Year of Abolition Rule @ Washington"
written by Rose in 1863. In it she talks about a "child who died a few
months before" (pg. 87), writes that Rose is 8 years old at this time (pg
216), visitors allowed, Mrs. James Madison Cutts (sister), Mrs. Stephen
A Douglass (niece), and a Mrs. Leonard (Mrs. Leonard is identified as a
sister pg. 303) and other family members (pg 117). A description of her
home and confinment area reports a photograph of her deceased daughter,
Gertrude Greenhow, 16 years, who died sometime since (pg 207) and also
a photo of Mrs. Florence Moore (pg 210).</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>It looks as though Gertrude was
either the oldest or next to the oldest daughter, Mrs. Florence Moore another
daughter, possibly the</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>youngest(Leila?) died 6 months to

<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Excerpt from The Life of Stephen
A. Douglas, by William Gardner.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Stephen Arnold Douglas was born
at Brandon, Vermont, on the 23rd of April, 1813. His father was a physician,
descended from Scotch ancestors, who had settled in Connecticut before
the Revolution. his mother was the daughter of a prosperous Vermont farmer.
Before he was three months old his father, whose only fortune was his practice,
suddenly died. A bachelor brother of the widow took the family to his home
near Brandon, where they lived for fifteen years. When not needed at more
important work Stephen attended the common school. but the serious business
of life was tilling his uncle's fields.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>At fifteen he sought help to prepare
for college. His uncle declined to assume the burden of his education and
advised him to shun the perils of professional life and adopt the safe
and honorable career of a farmer. The advice was rejected and he obtained
permission to earn his way and shape his future. He walked to Middlebury,
a distance of fourteen miles, and apprenticed himself to a cabinet maker.
He worked with energy and enthusiasm, became a good mechanic and bade fair
to win success at his trade, but owning to delicate health he abandoned
the shop after less than two years' service, and entered the academy at
Brandon, where he pursued his studies for about a year, when his mother
married again and moved to Canandiagua, New York. He there entered an academy
and continued an industrious student for nearly three years, devoting part
of his time to law study. This ended his preliminary training. He quit
the schools and applied himself to the work of practical life.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>In June, 1833, he left home to push
his fortune in the West. His health was delicate, his stock of money scant.
He went to Cleveland, Ohio, where he became acquainted with a lawyer named
Andrews, who, pleased with the appearance of the youth, invited him to
share his office and use his library, with the promise of a partnership
when admitted to the bar. The offer was accepted and he began his duties
as law clerk. A week later he was taken seriously sick, and at the end
of his long illness the doctors advised him to return home. He rejected
the advice and in October took passage on a canal boat for Portsmouth,
on the Ohio river, and went thence to Cincinnati. For a week he sought
employment. Unable to find it he went to Louisville, where another week
was spent in vain quest of work. He continued his journey to St. Louis,
where he landed in the late autumn. An eminent lawyer offered him free
use of his library, but an empty purse compelled him to decline the offer
and seek immediate work. He went to Jacksonville, Illinois, arriving late
in November, and addressed himself to the pressing problem of self-support.
The remnant of his cash amount to thirty-seven cents.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>In those days Illinois was a frontier
State with about 200,000 population, chiefly settled in its southern half.
A large part of the people were from the South and, in defiance of the
law, owned many negro slaves. The Capital was at Vandalia, although Jacksonville
and Springfield were the towns of highest promise and brightest prospects.
Chicago contained a few score of people to whom the Indians were still
uncomfortably close neighbors. Railroads and canals were beginning to be
built, with promise of closer relations between the villages and settlements
theretofore lost in the solitudes.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Finding no employment at Jacksonville,
he sold his few books to keep off hunger and walked to Winchester. On the
morning after his arrival he found a crowd assembled on the street where
a public sale was about to open. Delay was occasioned by the want of a
competent clerk and he was hired for two dollars a day to keep the record
of the sale. He was then employed to teach a private school in the town
at a salary of forty dollars a month. Besides teaching he found time to
read a few borrowed law books and try an occasional case before the village
justice.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Having been admitted to the bar
in March, 1834, he opened a law office at Jacksonville. His professional
career, though successful, was so completely eclipsed by the brilliancy
of his political achievements that it need not detain us. The readiness
and agility of his mind; the adaptability of his convictions to the demands
of the hour; his self-confident energy, were such that he speedily developed
into a good trial lawyer and won high standing at the bar. That the profession
was not then as lucrative as it has since become, is evidenced by the fact
that he traveled from Springfield to Bloomington and argued a case for
a fee of five dollars.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>But his time and energy were devoted
to politics rather than law.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>The strategy of parties interested
him more than Coke or Justinian. Jacksonville was a conservative, religious
town, whose population consisted chiefly of New England Puritans and Whigs.
But the prairies were settled by a race of thoroughly Democratic pioneers
to whom the rough victor at New Orleans was a hero in war and a master
in statecraft.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Douglas was an enthusiastic Democrat
and an ardent admirer of President Jackson. The favorite occupation of
the young lawyer, not yet harassed by clients, was to talk politics to
the farmers, or gather them into his half furnished office and discuss
more gravely the questions of party management.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>A few days after his arrival the
opportunity came to distinguish himself in the field of his future achievements.
A mass meeting was called at the court house for the purpose of endorsing
the policy of the President in removing the deposits of public money from
the United States bank and vetoing the bill for its recharter. The opposition
was bitter. In the state of public temper it was a delicate task to present
the resolutions. The man who had undertaken it lost courage at the sight
of the multitude and handed them to Douglas, and the crowd looked with
amused surprise when the young stranger, who was only five feet tall, appeared
on the platform. He read the resolutions of endorsement and supported them
in a brief speech.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>When he sat down, Josiah Lamborn,
an old and distinguished lawyer and politician, attacked him and the resolutions
in a speech of caustic severity. Douglas rose to reply. The people cheered
the plucky youngster. The attack had sharpened the faculties and awakened
his fighting courage. He had unexpectedly found the field of action in
which he was destined to become an incomparable master. For an hour he
poured out an impassioned harangue, without embarrassment or hesitation.
Astonishment at what seemed a quaint freak soon gave way to respect and
admiration, and at the close of this remarkable address the hall and courtyard
rang with loud applause. The excited crowed seized the little orator, lifted
him on their shoulders and bore him in triumph around the square.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>The young adventurer in the fields
of law and politics was thenceforth a man of mark-a man to be reckoned
with in Illinois.</font></font>

<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>From a contemporary press report:</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>"It is with profound regret that
the Association announces the passing of this popular and distinguished
officer.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>This soldier-inventor was a native
Californian, born at Mare Island on November 13, 1878, and raised in the
midst of the environment of the Old Navy, the son of Lieutenant Commander
Richard M. Cutts, USN.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>He was an Ensign in the Navy during
the war with Spain and in July 1899 was made a Second Lieutenant in the
United States Marine Corps, in 1900 a Captain, in 1903 a Major and in 1916
and 1917 a Lieutenant Colonel and in 1922 a Colonel.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>His career approached what a Marine
officer so desires, namely a well-rounded one. His service took him to
the Philippines in 1903, to Cuba in 1912, to Honolulu in 1915. He was aide
to the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet in 1918, from which assignment
he went to command the 10th Regiment at Quantico, Virginia, and, following
this assignment, be became Fleet Marine Officer of the Atlantic Control
Force. In 1923 and 1924 he had the very important assignment of Commandant
of the Santo Domingo National Army.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>It was during this assignment that
he organized the defensive arm for the Dominican government, and such organization
remains intact. Colonel Cutts has often said that he considered this special
service the best service he has given to his country. His last foreign
duty was as a Brigade commander in Haiti. Upon his return to the United
States in 1931, he was assigned duty at the Naval War College, Newport,
Rhode Island. He remained on the staff of this institution until he was
placed on leave, and remained on leave at the time of his death.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>He will be remembered by the fact
that he invented and perfected the Cutts Compensator, a device which alleviates
the shock transmitted upon firing a gun or rifle. The Cutts Compensator
was aaccepted by our Government and is also in use by several foreign governments.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>His services afforded him the privilege
of wearing five campaign medals. He was the proud possessor of two letters
of commendation, one from the Secretary of War, and one from the Secretary
of the Navy, for his soldierly qualities and administrative abilities.
He was recommended by the Major General Commandant for the advancement
to the grade of Brigadier General, but his health could not permit him
to enjoy this advancement.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>The passing of Colonel Cutts will
be sad news to the many friends he made during his 35 years of service.
He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on November 30, 1934, his
funeral being attended by high-ranking officers from the Army, Navy and
Marine Corps."</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>He was born on November 13, 1878
and died on November 24, 1934 and is buried in Section 2 of Arlington National
Cemetery.</font></font><font color="#006600"><font size=+1></font></font>
