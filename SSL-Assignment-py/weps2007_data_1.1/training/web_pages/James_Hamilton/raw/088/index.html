<p><A HREF="http://www.tctwest.net/~hri/roberth.html">Robert and Sarah Hamilton's</A> son, James (designated as Sr.) married Rebecca Brownfield who born in 1795 and died August 28, 1865.  They were married in 1813.  James was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and was married there.  He served during the War of 1812 as a sergeant and was married immediately after his return home.  He served with General Harrison in the West and became distinguished as a gallant and intrepid soldier.  They settled in Preston County, Virginia, (now West Virginia) in 1813 or 1814.  Preston County was then a part of Monongalia County.  They set up housekeeping on 400 acres of wild land, all woodland, which he bought or fell heir to through his wife.  He also drew 80 acres of land in Iowa as a bonus for his service during the war.  Taxes on record (1810) were 48 cents on 400 acres.<P> James was a tanner by trade and a harness and saddle maker.  He learned his trade in Uniontown, Pennsylvania.  As a tanner he prepared deer and other skins which he carried by pack horse to market in Virginia.  His nearest and best market was Winchester, Virginia, which was 100 miles east, across the Allegheny Mountains, where the road had hardly been opened.  He also had to go to Winchester once each year to pay his taxes.  He carried oats by extra horse each year. The oats sold for 25 cents a bushel and provided the tax money.  Sometimes there was a little extra supply of homemade linen, which found a ready market at Winchester.  Tax receipts issued in 1810 showed taxes on 400 acres on 400 acres to be 48 cents, but another statement says they were 67 cents at first.<P>Quoting "After the Cessation of Hostilities (War of 1812) he settled with his young wife on the banks of Big Sandy among the oaken forests in the southwestern part of the county.  An early pioneer, he spent a life of toil in opening and cultivating a farm among the hills and heavy timber.  He delighted in the sports and pursuits of the early settlers, prominent among which was that of hunting.  In this his success was remarkable.  He loved to roam through the wild, broad woods and 'To hold converse with nature's charms and view her stores unrolled'.  He and the pious, ever cheerful Aunt Becca, his wife, were widely known for their hospitality and kindness; their house being like the home of the traveling stranger and of the neighboring friend." (Copied from his obituary).  James, Sr., died in Scott County, Missouri, where he had gone to visit relatives.<P>The children of James and Rebecca Hamilton were:

SARAH HAMILTON BAKER<A NAME="Sarah Hamilton Baker"> was born in 1816 and died January 14, 1904.  She was married to Joseph Baker in 1838.  She was a widow some 25 years before she died and made her home most of that time with one of her daughters, Mrs. Bonsfield.  Her son, Dr. Norval H. Baker, better known as Hamilton (or Ham) Baker, was a doctor and surgeon who graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1880.  He came from West Virginia to Minnesela, South Dakota, in 1885, the first doctor to locate in the Bell Fourche Valley.  He put in a small stock of drugs and was the only druggist as well as doctor nearer than Deadwood which was at least 25 miles away.  He bought himself a good team of ponies and a buckboard, the fastest mode of travel of that day.  His family joined him the next spring--1886.  He later moved to Belle Fourche, then to Sundance, Wyoming and finally to Gillette, Wyoming.  He and his wife had three children, Ham, Jr., Lena, and another son.  He served in the Spanish-American War.<HR></a><A HREF="http://www.tctwest.net/~hri/williamh.html">WILLIAM HAMILTON </A> was born in Preston County, West Virginia on March 8, 1825.  For more details on his life and the life of his children please follow the above link. <HR>MINERVA HAMILTON DENNISTON'S husband, Thomas Denniston, was a teamster hired to haul provisions in the Civil War.  He was not enlisted so Minerva was not able to get a pension and had a hard time raising her four girls. <HR>JACKSON and Lucretia (Chris) HAMILTON came with their son, Jone, and daughter, Rose, from West Virginia to Western, Nebraska, a small town in the center of the state, in 1885, where their son Will had gone the year before.  They stayed there about a year, then went on to the Belle Fourche River country in South Dakota, where, again, their son Will had preceded them by about a year.  Jackson and Will filed on homesteads and after they had proved up, Will and Jone went to the Cave Hills and established a ranch there.  In 1897 they sold their cattle (calves thrown in) and saddle horses for $430 a piece and threw in the ranch.  They traded their 125 head of range horses (and colts) at $10.00 a head for about 50 head of cattle at $26.00 a head.  Then Jone bought a ranch from Al Clarkson at Table Mountain and also bought Will's share of the cattle.  Each kept a team and one saddle horse.  Jone sold the ranch the next year to Fred Stearns and went back to Minnesela and farmed for a couple of years before going back to the Cave Hills buying a ranch on the north side of the Hills.  Jackson had died in the meantime and Lucretia had moved to Minnesela and bought several vacant lots under a ditch that ran through the little town, so she could "always raise a garden".  She lived there until her death.  Will moved back to the Belle
Fourche valley and farmed and raised cattle and hogs until 1901 or 1902, when he sold out (the land for $5.00 an acre) and moved to Fulton, Missouri, where he spent the rest of his life.  Jone left the Cave Hills and finally retired to Sturgis.  Jone married Armein (Minnie) Arpan, the daughter of French Canadians who lived on Indian Creek and they had three sons, Aaron, Oran, and Oliver.  Will married Nancy Ellen Showalter in Virginia on February 5, 1893.  Their children were:  William Jackson, born July 25, 1894; Sara Lucretia, Born April 3, 1896, Ray Showalter, born March 6, 1898, and Harold Henry, born in December of 1903.  Rose married
William Dolan in 1895.  They had one daughter, Lucretia, who married a man by the name of Jones.  Rose spent most of her life with her mother.  Both she and Lucretia's husband died of tuberculosis.  Two things remembered by two grand nieces are that Aunt Chris and Rose chewed snuff and Jone was something of a food faddist.<HR>JAMES HAMILTON was born on a farm near Evansville, Preston County, West Virginia, on
September 4, 1839 and died in 1932.  At 21 he spent four months in Iowa and Missouri, but returned to West Virginia and entered government service, first as a teamster, then as a soldier.  As a member of the 6th West Virginia Cavalry in the Civil War, he was one of the soldiers who surrounded and burned the barn near Bowling Green in which John Wilkes Booth took refuge and was shot to death.  He also did police duty in Washinton after Lee's surrender at Appomatiox until the grand review of the federal armies, and as such was one of a daily escort of the confederates of Booth during their trial by a military commission.  His brothers, William and Jackson both served in the Civil War.  In 1866 he was sent out as far as Kansas, Nebraska and southern Wyoming.  His command had not been disband and they were sent to guard the frontier against the Indians.  In 1900 he made a trip to South Dakota and was able to see the Black Hills, which he had wanted to while in the West, but his company was not allowed to go that far into the Indian country at that time.<HR>NOTE OF INTEREST:  All of the old buildings on the original Hamilton land are gone.  The original log church, a Union Church, is gone.  James gave land and on it was built a United Bretheren Church.  By it is a
cemetery where he and his wife are buried.  Quite a few Hamiltons are buried there.
