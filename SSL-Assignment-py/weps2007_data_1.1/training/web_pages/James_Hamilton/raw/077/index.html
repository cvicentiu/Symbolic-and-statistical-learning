<P><i>James VI played all sides of the religious fence in order to gain support for his accession.  This letter appears to be written for a Puritan audience.</i>

<P>Mr.Hambleton,</P>

<P>Although I never doubted and was ever sufficiently informed of the goodwill borne towards me in all lawful sort (for otherwise I never did nor shall require them) by all the honest subjects of England that sincerely profess the only true religion, professed and by the laws established in both these countries (the bond of conscience being the only sure bond for tying of men's affections to them whom to they owe a natural duty), yet, having the same renewed and confirmed unto me bv your late advertisments, I have thought good by this present, all written with mine own hand, to set you down a meeting for them in this point.  That is, that ye shall, in my name, assure all the honest men ye can meet with that are affected that way, and that in the princely word of a Christian king: that, as I have ever without swerving professed and maintained the same religion within all the bounds of my kingdom, so may they assure themselves that how soon it shall please God lawfully to possess me with the crown of that kingdom wherein they are subjects, I shall not only maintain and continue the profession of the Gospel there, but withal not suffer or permit any other religion to be professed and avowed within the bounds of that kingdom.  But because you have been, at your last being with me, particularly acquainted with my intentions in this point, as also that yourself is so well known and approved unto them there, ye shall by tongue more particularly inform them of my mind herein, resolving them of such malicious calumnies and unjust imputations as have been from time to time, by my undeserved enemies, contrived against me.  And thus I bid you heartily farewell.</p>

<P>JAMES R.</P>
