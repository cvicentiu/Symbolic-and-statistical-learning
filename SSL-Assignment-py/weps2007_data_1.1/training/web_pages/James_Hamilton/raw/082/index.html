<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font color="#800000"><i>ALEXANDER HAMILTON</i></font></b><span style="font-size: 12pt"> 
was born a British subject on the island of Nevis in the West Indies on January 
11, 1755. His father was James Hamilton, a Scottish merchant of St. Christopher. 
Hamilton's mother was Rachael Fawcette Levine, of French Huguenot descent. When 
Rachael was very young, she had married a Danish proprietor of St. Croix named 
John Michael Levine. Ms. Levine left her husband and was later divorced from him 
on June 25, 1759. Under the Danish law which had granted her divorce, she was 
forbidden from remarrying. Thus, Hamilton's birth was illegitimate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Business 
failures resulted the bankruptcy of his father and with the death of his mother, 
Alexander entered the counting house of Nicholas Cruger and David Beekman, 
serving as a clerk and apprentice at the age of twelve. By the age of fifteen, 
Alexander was left in charge of the business. Opportunities for regular 
schooling were very limited. With the aid of funds advanced by friends, Hamilton 
studied at a grammar school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. In 1774, he graduated 
and entered King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City and 
obtained a bachelor's of arts degree in just one year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The War of 
Independence had began and at a mass meeting held in the fields in New York City 
on July 6, 1774, Hamilton made a sensational speech attacking British policies. 
Hamilton's military aspirations flowered with a series of early 
accomplishments. On March 14, 1776, he was commissioned captain of a company of 
artillery set up by the New York Providential Congress. Hamilton's company 
participated at the Battle of Long Island in August of 1776. At White Plains, in 
October of 1776, his battery guarded Chatterton's Hill and protected the 
withdrawal of William Smallwood's militia. On January 3, 1777, Hamilton's 
military reputation won the interest of General Nathaniel Greene. General Greene 
introduced the young Captain to General Washington with a recommendation for 
advancement. Washington made Hamilton his aide-de-camp and personal secretary 
with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He served four years as Washington's 
personal secretary and confidential aide.  Longing for active military service, 
he resigned from Washington's staff after a dispute with the general, but 
remained in the army. At the Battle of Monmouth (June 28, 1778), Hamilton again 
proved his bravery and leadership and he also won laurels at Yorktown (Sept. – 
Oct. 1781), where he led the American column in a final assault in the British 
works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Hamilton married 
Elizabeth, the daughter of General Philip Schuyler on December 14, 1780. The 
Schuylers were one of the most distinguished families in New York. This 
connection placed Hamilton in the center of New York society. In 1782, he was 
admitted to legal practice in New York and became an assistant to Robert Morris 
who was then superintendent of finance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Hamilton was 
elected a member of the Continental Congress in 1782. He at once became a 
leading proponent of a stronger national government than what had been provided 
for by the Articles of Confederation. As a New York delegate to the 
Constitutional Convention of 1787, he advocated a national government that would 
have virtually abolished the states and even called for a president for life to 
provide energetic leadership. Hamilton left the convention at the end of June, 
but he did approve the Constitution subsequently drafted by his colleagues as 
preferable to the Articles of Confederation, although it was not as strong as he 
wished. Hamilton used his talents to secure the adoption of the Constitution and 
published a letter in the Constitution's defense. This letter was published in 
the New York Independent Journal on Oct. 2, 1787</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Hamilton was one 
of three authors of The Federalist. This work remains a classic commentary on 
American constitutional law and the principals of government. Its inception and 
approximately three-quarters of the work are attributable to Hamilton (the rest 
belonging to John Jay and James Madison). Hamilton also won the New York 
ratification convention vote for the Constitution against great odds in July 
17-July 26, 1788. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<span style="font-size: 12pt" Roman?; New Roman?;mso-fareast-font-family:?Times Times>
During Washington's presidency, Hamilton became the first secretary of the 
Treasury. Holding this office from September 11, 1789 to January 31, 1795, he 
proved himself a brilliant administrator in organizing the Treasury. In 1790 
Hamilton submitted to Congress a report on the public credit that provided for 
the funding of national and foreign debts of the United States, as well as for 
federal assumption of the states' revolutionary debts. After some controversy, 
the proposals were adopted, as were his subsequent reports calling for the 
establishment of a national bank. He is chiefly responsible for establishing the 
credit of the United States, both at home and abroad. In foreign affairs his 
role was almost as influential. He persuaded Washington to adopt a policy of 
neutrality after the outbreak of war in Europe in 1793, and in 1794 he wrote the 
instructions for the diplomatic mission to London that resulted in the 
Anglo-American agreement known as Jay's Treaty. Hamilton also became the 
esteemed leader of one of the two great political parties of the time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">After the death 
of George Washington, the leadership of the Federalist Party became divided 
between John Adams and Hamilton. John Adams had the prestige from his varied and 
great career and from his great strength with the people. Conversely, Hamilton 
controlled practically all of the leaders of lesser rank and the greater part of 
the most distinguished men in the country.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Hamilton, by 
himself, was not a leader for the population. After Adams became President, 
Hamilton constantly advised the members of the cabinet and endeavored to control 
Adams's policy. On the eve of the presidential election of 1800, Hamilton wrote 
a bitter personal attack on the president that contained confidential cabinet 
information. Although this pamphlet was intended for private circulation, the 
document was secured and published by Aaron Burr, Hamilton's political and legal 
rival. Based on his opinion of Burr, Hamilton deemed it his patriotic duty to 
thwart Burr's ambitions. Burr forced a quarrel and subsequently challenged 
Hamilton to a duel. The duel was fought at Weehawken on the New Jersey shore of 
the Hudson River opposite New York City. At forty-nine, Hamilton was shot, fell 
mortally wounded, and died the following day, July 12, 1804. It is unanimously 
reported that Hamilton himself did not intend to fire, his pistol going off 
involuntarily as he fell. Hamilton was apparently opposed to dueling following 
the fatal shooting of his son Philip in a duel in 1801. Further, Hamilton told 
the minister who attended him as he laid dying, "I have no ill-will against Col. 
Burr. I met him with a fixed resolution to do him no harm. I forgive all that 
happened." His death was very generally deplored as a national calamity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Apart from his 
contributions to The Federalist and his reorganization of the United States 
financial system in the 1790's Hamilton is best remembered for his consistent 
emphasis on the need for a strong central government. His advocacy of the 
doctrine of "implied powers" to advance a broad interpretation of the 
Constitution has been invoked frequently to justify the extension of federal 
authority and has greatly influence a number of Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>

</i>
<p>HAMILTON, Alexander, statesman, born in the island of Nevis, West Indies, 11 
January, 1757; died in New York city, 12 July, 1804. A curious mystery and 
uncertainty overhang his birth and parentage, and even the accounts of his son 
and biographer vary with and contradict each other. The accepted version is, 
that he was the son of James Hamilton, a Scottish merchant, and his wife, a 
French lady named Faucette, the divorced wife of a Dane named Lavine. According 
to another story, his mother was a Miss Lytton, and her sister came subsequently 
to this country, where she was watched over and supported by Hamilton and his 
wife. A similar doubt is also connected with his paternity, which now cannot be 
solved, even were it desirable. His father became bankrupt "at an early day," to 
use Hamilton's own words, and the child was thus thrown upon the care of his 
mother's relatives. His education seems to have been brief and desultory, and 
chiefly due to the Reverend Hugh Knox, a Presbyterian clergyman of Nevis, who 
took a great interest in the boy and kept up an affectionate correspondence with 
him in after-days when his former pupil was on the way to greatness. </p>
<p>In 1777 his old tutor wrote to Hamilton that he must be the annalist and 
biographer, as well as the aide-de-camp, of General Washington, and the 
historiographer of the American war of independence. Before Hamilton was 
thirteen years of age it was apparently necessary that he should earn his 
living, and he was therefore placed in the office of Nicholas Cruger, a West 
Indian merchant. His precocity was extraordinary, owing, perhaps in some 
measure, to his early isolation and self-dependence, and at an age when most 
boys are thinking of marbles and hockey he was writing to a friend and playmate 
of his ambition and his plans for the future. Most boys have day-dreams; but 
there is a definiteness and precision about Hamilton's that make them seem more 
like the reveries of twenty than of thirteen. Even more remarkable was the 
business capacity that he displayed at this time. His business letters, many of 
which have been preserved, would have done credit to a trained clerk of any age, 
and his employer was apparently in the habit of going away and leaving this mere 
child in charge of all the affairs of his counting house. The boy also wrote for 
the local press, contributing at one time an account of a severe hurricane that 
had devastated the islands, which was so vivid and strong a bit of writing that 
it attracted general attention. </p>
<p>This literary success, joined probably to the friendly advocacy of Dr. Knox, 
led to the conviction that something ought to be done for a boy who was clearly 
fitted for a higher position than a West Indian counting house. Funds were 
accordingly provided by undefined relatives and more distinct friends, and thus 
equipped, Hamilton sailed for Boston, Massachusetts, where he arrived in 
October, 1772, and whence he proceeded to New York. Furnished by Dr. Knox with 
good letters, he speedily found friends and counselors, and by their advice went 
to a school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, where he studied with energy to 
prepare for college, and employed his pen in much writing, of both prose and 
poetry. He entered King's college, New York now Columbia, and there with the aid 
of a tutor made remarkable progress. While he was thus engaged, our difficulties 
with England were rapidly ripening. Hamilton's natural inclinations were then, 
as always, toward the side of order and established government, but a visit to 
Boston in the spring of 1774, and a close examination of the questions in 
dispute, convinced him of the justice of the cause of the colonies. His 
opportunity soon came. A great meeting was held in the fields, 6 July, 1774, to 
force the lagging Tory assembly of New York into line. Hamilton was among the 
crowd, and as he listened he became more and more impressed, not by what was 
said, but by what the speakers omitted to say. Pushing his way to the front, he 
mounted the platform, and while the crowd cried <i>"A collegian! A collegian!"</i> 
this stripling of seventeen began to pour out an eloquent and fervid speech in 
behalf of colonial rights. </p>
<p>Once engaged, Hamilton threw himself into the struggle with all the intense 
energy of his nature. He left the platform to take up the pen, and his two 
pamphlets--<i>"A Full Vindication"</i> and <i>"The Farmer Refuted" </i>
--attracted immediate and general attention. Indeed, these productions were so 
remarkable, at a time when controversial writings of great ability abounded, 
that they were generally attributed to Jay and other well-known patriots. The 
discovery of their authorship raised Hamilton to the position of a leader in New 
York. Events now moved rapidly, the war for which he had sighed in his first 
boyish letter came, and he of course was quick to take part in it. </p>
<p>Early in 1776 he was given the command of a company of artillery by the New 
York convention, and by his skill in organization, and his talent for command, 
he soon had a body of men that furnished a model of appearance and discipline at 
a time when those qualities were as uncommon as they were needful. At Long 
Island and at White Plains the company distinguished itself, and the gallantry 
of the commander, as well as the appearance of the men, which had already 
attracted the notice of <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/nathanaelgreene.com">General Greene</a>, led to 
an offer from Washington of a place on his staff. This offer Hamilton accepted, 
and thus began the long and intimate connection with Washington which suffered 
but one momentary interruption. Hamilton filled an important place on
<a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/george-washington.org">Washington's staff,</a> and his ready pen made 
him almost indispensable to the commander-in-chief. Beside his immediate duties, 
the most important task that fell to him was when he was sent to obtain troops 
front <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/horatiogates.com">General Gates</a>, after the
<a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/johnburgoyne.net">Burgoyne campaign</a>. This was a difficult and 
delicate business; but Hamilton conducted it with success, and, by a wise 
admixture of firmness and tact, carried his point. He also took such part as was 
possible for a staff officer in all the battles fought by Washington, and in the 
Andre affair he was brought into close contact both with Andre and Mrs. Arnold, 
of whom he has left a most pathetic and picturesque description. </p>
<p>On 16 February, 1781, Hamilton took hasty offence at a reproof given him by 
Washington, and resigned from the staff, but he remained in the army, and at 
Yorktown commanded a storming party, which took one of the British redoubts. 
This dashing exploit practically closed Hamilton's military service in the 
Revolution, which had been highly creditable to him both as a staff and field 
officer. In the midst of his duties as a soldier, however, Hamilton had found 
time for much else. On his mission to Gates he met at Albany Miss Elizabeth 
Schuyler, whom he married on 14 December, 1780, and so became connected with a 
rich and powerful New York family, which was of marked advantage to him in many 
ways. During the Revolution, too, he had found leisure to study finance and 
government, and his letters on these topics to <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/Robert-Morris.com">
Robert Morris</a> and James Duane display a remarkable grasp of both subjects. 
He showed in these letters how to amend the confederation and how to establish a 
national bank, and his plans thus set forth were not only practicable, but 
evince his peculiar fitness for the great work before him. His letters on the 
bank, indeed, so impressed Norris that when Hamilton left the army and was 
studying law, Morris offered him the place of continental receiver of taxes for 
New York, which he at once accepted. At the same time he was admitted to the 
bar, and he threw himself into the work of his profession and of his office with 
his wonted zeal. </p>
<p>The exclusion of the Tories from the practice of the law gave a fine opening 
to their young rivals on the patriot side; but the business of collecting taxes 
was a thankless task, which only served to bring home to Hamilton more than ever 
the fatal defects of the confederation. From these uncongenial labors he was 
relieved by an election to congress, where he took his seat in November, 1782. 
The most important business then before congress was the ratification of peace; 
but the radical difficulties of the situation arose from the shattered finances 
and from the helplessness and imbecility of the confederation. Hamilton flung 
himself into these troubles with the enthusiasm of youth and genius, but all in 
vain. The case was hopeless. He extended his reputation for statesmanlike 
ability and brilliant eloquence, but effected nothing, and withdrew to the 
practice of his profession in 1783, more than ever convinced that the worthless 
fabric of the confederation must be swept away, and something better and 
stronger put in its place. This great object was never absent from his mind, and 
as he rapidly rose at the bar he watched with a keen eye the course of public 
affairs, and awaited an opening. Matters went rapidly from bad to worse. The 
states were bankrupt, and disintegration threatened them. Internecine commercial 
regulations destroyed prosperity, and riot and insurrection menaced society. At 
last Virginia, in January, 1786, proposed a convention at Annapolis, Maryland, 
to endeavor to make some common commercial regulations. </p>
<p>Hamilton's opportunity had come, and, slender as it was, he seized it with a 
firm grasp. He secured the election of delegates from New York, and in company 
with Egbert Benson betook himself to Annapolis in September, 1786. After the 
fashion of the time, only five states responded to the call; but the meager 
gathering at least furnished a stepping-stone to better things. The convention 
agreed upon an address, which was drawn by Hamilton, and toned down to suit the 
susceptibilities of <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/edmundrandolph.com">Edmund Randolph.</a> This 
address set forth the evil condition of public affairs, and called a new 
convention, with enlarged powers, to meet in Philadelphia, 2 May, 1787. This 
done, the next business was to make the coming convention a success, and 
Hamilton returned to New York to devote himself to that object. He obtained an 
election to the legislature, and there fought the hopeless battles of the 
general government against the <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/georgeclinton.org">Clintonian forces</a>, 
and made himself felt in all the legislation of the year; but he never lost 
sight of his main purpose, the appointment of delegates to Philadelphia. This he 
finally accomplished, and was chosen with two leaders of the opposition, Yates 
and Lansing, to represent New York in the coming convention. Hamilton's own 
position despite his victory in obtaining delegates was trying; for in the 
convention the vote of the state, on every question, was east against him by his 
colleagues. He, however, did the best that was possible. </p>
<p>At an early day, when a relaxing and feeble tendency appeared in the 
convention, he introduced his own scheme of government, and supported it in a 
speech of five hours, His plan was much higher in tone, and much stronger, than 
any other, since it called for a president and senators for life, and for the 
appointment of the governors of states by the national executive. It aimed, in 
fact, at the formation of an aristocratic instead of a Democratic republic. Such 
a scheme had no chance of adoption, and of course Hamilton was well aware of 
this, but it served its purpose by clearing the atmosphere and giving the 
convention a more vigorous tone. After delivering his speech, Hamilton withdrew 
from the convention, where his colleagues rendered him hopelessly inactive, and 
only returned toward the end to take part in the closing debates, and to affix 
his name to the constitution. </p>
<p>It was when the labors of the convention were completed and laid before the 
people that Hamilton's great work for the constitution really began. He 
conceived and started <i><a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/federalistpapers.org">"The Federalist,"</a></i> 
and wrote most of those famous essays which riveted the attention of the 
country, furnished the weapons of argument and exposition to those who <i>
"thought continentally"</i> in all the states, and did more than any thing else 
toward the adoption of the constitution. In almost all the states the popular 
majority was adverse to the constitution, and in the New York ratifying 
convention the vote stood at the outset two to one against adoption. In a 
brilliant contest, Hamilton, by arguments rarely equaled in the history of 
debate, either in form or eloquence, by skilful management, and by wise delay, 
finally succeeded in converting enough votes, and carried ratification 
triumphantly. It was a great victory, and in the Federal procession in New York 
the Federal ship bore the name of <i>"Hamilton."</i> From the convention the 
struggle was transferred to the polls. <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/georgeclinton.org">George 
Clinton</a> was strong enough to prevent the choice of senators, but at the 
election he only retained his own office by a narrow majority; his power was 
broken, and the Federalists elected four of the six representatives in congress. 
In this fight Hamilton led, and when the choice of senators was finally made he 
insisted, in his imperious fashion, on the choice of <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/rufusking.org">
Rufus King</a> and <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/philipschuyler.com">General Schuyler</a>, thus 
ignoring the <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/davidlivingstone.com">Livingstons</a>, a political blunder 
that soon cost the Federalists control of the state of New York. </p>
<p>In April, 1789, Washington was inaugurated, and when the treasury department 
was at, last organized, in September, he at once placed Hamilton at the head of 
it. In the five years that ensued Hamilton did the work that lies at the 
foundation of our system of administration, gave life and meaning to the 
constitution, and by his policy developed two great political parties. To give 
in any detail an account of what he did would be little less than to write the 
history of the republic during those eventful years. On 14 January, 1790, he 
sent to congress the first <i>"Report on the Public Credit,"</i> which is one of 
the great state papers of our history, and which marks the beginning and 
foundation of our government. In that wonderful document, and with a master's 
hand, he reduced our confused finances to order, provided for a funding system 
and for taxes to meet it, and displayed a plan for the assumption of the state 
debts. The financial policy thus set forth was put into execution, and by it our 
credit was redeemed, our union cemented, and our business and commercial 
prosperity restored. Yet outside of this great work and within one year Hamilton 
was asked to report, and did report fully, on the raising and collection of the 
revenue, and on a scheme for revenue cutters; as to estimates of income and 
expenditure; as to the temporary regulation of the currency; as to 
navigation-laws and the coasting trade; as to the post office; as to the 
purchase of West Point; as to the management of the public lands, and upon a 
great mass of claims, public and private. Rapidly, effectively, and successfully 
were all these varied matters dealt with and settled, and then in the succeeding 
years came from the treasury a report on the establishment of a mint, with an 
able discussion of Coins and coinage; a report on a national bank, followed by a 
great legal argument in the cabinet, which evoked the implied powers of the 
constitution; a report on manufactures, which discussed with profound ability 
the problems of political economy and formed the basis of the protective policy 
of the United States; a plan for an excise; numerous schemes for improved 
taxation; and finally a last great report on the public credit, setting forth 
the best methods for managing the revenue and for the speedy extinction of the 
debt. In the midst of these labors Hamilton was assailed in congress by his 
enemies, who were stimulated by <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/thomas-jefferson.org">Jefferson</a>, 
led by <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/jamesmadison.info">James Madison</a> and William B. Giles, and 
in an incredibly short time, in a series of reports on loans, he laid bare every 
operation of the treasury for three years, and thereafter could not get his 
foes, even by renewed invitations, to investigate him further. </p>
<p>Outside of his own department, Hamilton was hardly less active, and in the 
difficult and troubled times brought on by the French revolution he took a 
leading part in the determination of our foreign policy, he believed in a strict 
neutrality, and had no lemming to France. He sustained the neutrality 
proclamation in the cabinet, and defended it in the press under the signature of
<i>"Pacificus."</i> He strenuously supported Washington in his course toward 
France, and constantly urged more vigorous measures toward Edmond Charles Genet 
(q. v.) than the cabinet as a whole would adopt. During this period, too, his 
quarrel with Jefferson, which really typified the growth of two great political 
parties, came to a head. Jefferson sustained and abetted Freneau in his attacks 
upon the administration and the financial policy, and upon the secretary of the 
treasury most especially. Hamilton, too, forgetful of the dignity of his office, 
took up his pen and in a series of letters to the newspapers lashed Jefferson 
until he writhed beneath the blows. At last Washington interfered, and a peace 
was patched up between the warring secretaries; but the relation was too 
strained to endure, and Jefferson soon resigned and retired to Virginia. 
Hamilton was contemplating a similar step, but postponed taking it because he 
wished to complete certain financial arrangements, and he also felt unwilling to 
leave his office until the troubles arising in Pennsylvania from the excise were 
settled. These disturbances culminated in open riot and insurrection; but 
Washington and Hamilton were fully prepared to deal with the emergency. A 
vigorous proclamation was issued, an overwhelming force, which Hamilton 
accompanied, was marched into the insurgent counties, and the so-called 
rebellion faded away. </p>
<p>Hamilton now felt free to withdraw from the cabinet, a step that he was 
compelled to take from a lack of resources sufficient to support a growing 
family, and he accordingly resigned on 31 January, 1795. His neglected practice 
at once revived, and he soon stood at the head of the New York bar. But even his 
incessant professional duties could not keep him from public affairs. The
<a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/johnjay.net">Jay negotiation</a>, which he had done much to set on 
foot, came to an end, mid the treaty that resulted from it produced a fierce 
outburst of popular rage, which threatened to overwhelm Washington himself. 
Hamilton defended the treaty with voice and pen, writing a famous series of 
essays signed "Camillus," which had a powerful influence in changing public 
opinion. He was also consulted constantly by Washington, almost as much as if he 
had continued in the cabinet, and he furnished drafts and suggestions for 
messages and speeches, besides taking a large share in the preparation of the <i>
"Farewell Address." </i></p>
<p>Hamilton not only corresponded with and advised the president, but maintained 
the same relation with the members of the cabinet, and this fact was one 
fruitful source of the dissensions that arose in the Federalist party after the 
retirement of Washington. Hamilton supported <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/John-Adams.org">John Adams</a> 
loyally, if not very cordially, at the election of 1796, and intended to give 
him an equally loyal support when he assumed office, but the situation was an 
impossible one. Adams was the leader of the party de jure, Hamilton de facto, 
and at least three members of the cabinet looked from the first beyond their 
nominal and official chief to their real chief in New York. If Adams had 
possessed political tact, he might have managed Hamilton; but he neither could 
nor would attempt it, and Hamilton, on his side, was equally imperious and 
equally determined to have his own way. The two leaders agreed as to the special 
commission to France, and the commission went. They agreed as to the attitude to 
be assumed after the exposure of the <i>"X. Y. Z."</i> correspondence, and all 
went well. But, when it came to the provisional army, Adams's jealousy led him 
to resist Hamilton's appointment to the command, and a serious breach ensued.
</p>
<p>The influence of Washington prevailed, however, and Hamilton was given the 
post of inspector-general. For two years he was absorbed in the military duties 
thus imposed upon him, and his genius for organization comes out strongly in his 
correspondence relating to the formation, distribution, and discipline of the 
army. In the mean time the affairs of the party went from bad to worse. Mr. 
Adams reopened negotiations with France, which disgusted the war Federalists, 
and then expelled <a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/timothypickering.com">Timothy Pickering </a>and James 
McHenry from the cabinet, 12 May, 1800. He also gave loud utterance to his 
hatred of Hamilton, which speedily reached the latter's ears, and the Federalist 
party found themselves face to face with an election and torn by bitter 
quarrels. The Federalists were beaten by their opponents under the leadership of
<a href="http://famousamericans.net/alexanderhamilton/aaronburr.org">Burr </a>in the New York elections, mid Hamilton, 
smarting from defeat, proposed to Jay to call together the old legislature and 
refer the choice of electors to the people in districts. The proposition was 
wrong and desperate, and wholly unworthy of Hamilton, who seems to have been 
beside himself at the prospect of his party's impending ruin and the consequent 
triumph of Jefferson. He also made the fatal mistake of openly attacking Adams, 
and the famous pamphlet that he wrote against the president, after depicting 
Adams as wholly unfit for his high trust, lamely concluded by advising all the 
Federalists to vote for him. Such proceedings could have but one result, and the 
Federalists were beaten. The victors, however, were left in serious 
difficulties, for Burr and Jefferson received an equal number of votes, and the 
election was thrown into the house of representatives. The Federalists, eager 
for revenge on Jefferson, began to turn to Burr, and now Hamilton, recovered 
from his lit, of anger, threw himself into the breach, and, using all his great 
influence, was chiefly instrumental in securing the election of Jefferson, 
thereby fulfilling the popular will and excluding Burr, a great and high-minded 
service, which was a fit close to his public life. </p>
<p>After the election of Jefferson, Hamilton resumed the practice of his 
profession, and withdrew more and more into private life. But he could not 
separate himself entirely from politics, and continued to write upon them, and 
strove to influence and strengthen his party. As time wore on, and the breach 
widened between Jefferson and Burr, the latter renewed his intrigues with the 
Federalists, but through Hamilton's influence was constantly thwarted, and was 
finally beaten for the governorship of New York. Burr then apparently determined 
to fix a quarrel upon his life-long enemy, which was no difficult matter, for 
Hamilton had used the severest language about Burr--not once, but a hundred 
times--and it was easy enough to bring it home to him. Hamilton had no wish to 
go out with Burr but he was a fighting man, and, moreover, he was haunted by the 
belief that democracy was going to culminate in the horrors of the French 
revolution, that a strong man would be needed, and that society would turn to 
him for salvation -- a work for which he would be disqualified by the popular 
prejudice if he declined to fight a duel. He therefore accepted the challenge, 
met Burr on 11 July, 1804, on the bank of the Hudson at Weehawken, and fell 
mortally wounded at the first fire. </p>
<p>His tragic fate called forth a universal burst of grief, and drove Burr into 
exile, an outcast and a conspirator. The accompanying illustration represents 
the tomb that marks his grave in Trinity churchyard, New York. The preceding 
one, on page 57, is a picture of "The Grange," Hamilton's country residence on 
the upper part of Manhattan island. The thirteen trees that he planted to 
symbolize the original states of the Union survive in majestic proportions, and 
the mansion is still standing on the bluff overlooking the Hudson on one side 
and Long Island sound on the other, not far from 145th Street. </p>
<p>As time has gone on Hamilton's fame has grown, and he stands today as the 
most brilliant statesman we have produced. His constructive mind and 
far-reaching intellect are visible in every part of our system of government, 
which is the best and noblest monument of his genius. His writings abound in 
ideas which there and then found their first expression, and which he impressed 
upon our institutions until they have become so universally accepted and so very 
commonplace that their origin is forgotten. He was a brave and good soldier, and 
might well have been a great one had the opportunity ever come. He was the 
first, political writer of his time, with an unrivalled power of statement and a 
dear, forcible style, which carried conviction in every line. At the time of his 
death he was second to no man at the American bar, and was a master in debate 
and in oratory. In his family and among his friends he was deeply beloved and 
almost blindly followed. His errors and faults came from his strong, passionate 
nature, and his masterful will impatient of resistance or control. Yet these 
were the very qualities that carried him forward to his triumphs, and enabled 
him to perform services to the American people which can never be forgotten. </p>
<p>There are several portraits of the statesman by John Trumbull, and one by 
Wiemar; also a marble bust, modelled from life, by Ceraechi in 1794, of which 
the accompanying illustration, on page 56, is a copy. A full-length statue of 
Hamilton stands in the Central Park of New York. </p>
<p>Hamilton was the principal author of the series of essays called the <i>
"Federalist," </i>written in advocacy of a powerful and influential national 
government, which were published in a New York journal under the signature of <i>
"Publius"</i> in 1787-'8, before the adoption of the Federal constitution. There 
were eighty-five papers in all, of which Hamilton wrote fifty-one, James Madison 
fourteen, John Jay five, and Madison and Hamilton jointly three, while the 
authorship of the remaining twelve have been claimed by both Hamilton and 
Madison. As secretary of the treasury, he presented to congress an elaborate 
report on the public debt in 1789, and one on protective duties on imports in 
1791. In the <i>"Gazette of the United States,"</i> under the signature <i>"An 
American,"</i> he assailed Jefferson's financial views, while both were members 
of Washington's cabinet (1792); under that of <i>"Pacificus,"</i> defended in 
print the policy of neutrality between France and England (1793); and in a 
series of essays, signed <i>"Camillus,"</i> sustained the policy of ratifying 
Jay's treaty (1795). Other signatures used by him in his newspaper controversies 
were <i>"Cato," "Lucius Crassus," "Phocion," </i>and <i>"Scipio."</i> </p>
<p>In answer to the charges of corruption made by Monroe, he published a 
pamphlet, containing his correspondence with Monroe on the subject and the 
supposed incriminating letters on which the charges were based (1797). His <i>
"Observations on Certain Documents"</i> (Philadelphia, 1797) was republished in 
New York in 1865. In 1798 he defended in the newspapers the policy of increasing 
the army. His <i>"Works,"</i> comprising the <i>"Federalist,"</i> his most 
important official reports, and other writings, were published in three volumes 
(New York, 1810). His <i>"Official and other Papers," </i>edited by Francis L. 
Hawks, appeared in 1842. in 1851 his son, John C., issued a carefully prepared 
edition of his <i>"Works,"</i> comprising his correspondence and his political 
and official writings, civil and military, in seven volumes. A still larger 
collection of his <i>"Complete Works,"</i> including the <i>"Federalist,"</i> 
his private correspondence, and many hitherto unpublished documents, was edited, 
with an introduction and notes, by Henry Cabot Lodge (9 vols., 1885). In 1804 
appeared a "<i>Collection of Facts and Documents relative to the Death of 
Major-General Alexander Hamilton,"</i> by William Coleman. The same year his <i>
"Life"</i> was published in Boston by John Williams, under the pen-name <i>
"Anthony Pasquin,"</i> a reprint of which has been issued by the Hamilton club 
(New York, 1865). A <i>"Life of Alexander Hamilton"</i> (2 vols., 1834-'40) was 
published by his son, John Church, who also compiled an elaborate work entitled
<i>"History of the Republic of the United States, as traced in the Writings of 
Alexander Hamilton and his Contemporaries,"</i> the first volume of which 
contains a sketch of his father's career (1850-'8). See also his <i>"Life"</i> 
by Henry B. Renwick (1841); <i>"Life and Times of Alexander Hamilton,"</i> by 
Samuel M. Smucker (Boston, 1856); <i>"Hamilton and his Contemporaries,"</i> by 
Christopher J. Riethmueller (1864); <i>"Life of Hamilton," </i>by John T. Morse, 
Jr. (1876);<i>" Hamilton, a Historical Study," </i>by George Shea (New York, 
1877); <i>"Life and Epoch of Alexander Hamilton,"</i> by the same author 
(Boston, 1879)" and <i>"Life of Hamilton," </i>by Henry Cabot Lodge (American 
statesmen series, 1882). A list of the books written by or relating to Hamilton 
has been published under the title of "Bibliotheca Hamiltonia" by Paul L. Ford 
(New York, 1886). --His wife, Elizabeth, daughter of General Philip Schuyler, 
born in Albany, New York, 9 August, 1757; died in Washington, D. C., 9 November, 
1854. At the time of their marriage Hamilton was one of General Washington's 
aides, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. She rendered assistance to her 
husband in his labors, counselled him in his affairs, and kept his papers in 
order for him, preserving the large collection of manuscripts, which was 
acquired by the United States government in 1849, and has been utilized by the 
biographers of Alexander Hamilton and by historians, who have traced by their 
light the secret and personal influences that decided many public events between 
1775 and 1804. The accompanying portrait of Mrs. Hamilton, painted by James 
Earle, represents her at the age of twenty-seven. </p>
<p>--Their son, <font color="#800000">Philip Hamilton</font>, born 22 January, 
1782, was graduated at Columbia in 1800, and died of a wound received in a duel 
24 November, 1801, on the same spot where his father fell three years later. The 
young man, who showed much promise, became involved in a political quartel, and 
was challenged by his antagonist, whose name was Eckert. After the affair the 
father regarded with abhorrence the practice of duelling. He recorded his 
condemnation in a paper, written before going to the fatal meeting with Burr.</p>

inspector in the New York state militia, and afterward practiced law. He was 
acting secretary of state under President Jackson in 1829, being appointed ad 
interim on 4 March, but surrendering the office on the regular appointment of 
Martin Van Buren, two days later. On 3 April he was nominated United States 
district attorney for the southern district of New York. The degree of LL.D. was 
conferred upon him by Hamilton college, he published <i>"Reminiscences of 
Hamilton, or Men and Events, at Home and Abroad, during Three Quarters of a 
Century" (</i>New York, 1869).--</p>
