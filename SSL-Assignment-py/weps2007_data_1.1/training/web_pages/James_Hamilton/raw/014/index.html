This material has been developed under NSF grants 
SES-8720731, SES-8920752, SBR-9308301, SBR-9707771, and
SES-0076072, and is freely available to the public.  
The files are all stored in *.ZIP
format, so to use them after you have downloaded the file you will
need to use the PKUNZIP utility. 
If you do not have PKUNZIP, you can

 download it from PKWARE</A> </P>

<P> To download the programs and data below, just click on the
item you want and indicate what directory on your computer you
want the file stored in.  Suppose you dowload the file
MARKOV1.ZIP and put it in the directory
C:\JDH.  You should then type  <B> PKUNZIP -d C:\JDH\MARKOV1.ZIP
C:\JDH </B>. This should create a series of files and
subdirectories under the directory C:\JDH. </P>

Programs for estimation of Markov switching models by numerical
optimization. </A>  These are written in the GAUSS programming
language and require use of the GAUSS numerical optimization
procedures.  They are written for the numerical optimization
protocols from GAUSS version 2.0; other versions of GAUSS use
slightly different protocols and you may need to consult your GAUSS
manual to make slight changes in the lines that call the numerical
optimizers.  Note that the GAUSS routines should also run on Ox with the <a href = "http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/~laurent/m@ximize/index.html"> Ox Maximizer.</a> The GAUSS code here estimates a pth-order autoregression with K
states.  Data are provided for reproducing the analysis of U.S. GNP
as in <EM> Econometrica, March 1989, </EM> and 3-month Treasury bill rates
as in <EM> J. of Econ. Dynamics and Control,</EM> June/Sept. 1988.

Programs for estimation of Markov switching models using the EM
algorithm. </A> These are written in the GAUSS programming language.
They do not require use of the GAUSS numerical optimization
procedures and should work with little or no change on any version
of GAUSS, and again can also be run in <a href = "http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/~laurent/m@ximize/index.html" the > Ox programming language. </a>  This code estimates an N-dimensional vector whose mean
and covariance matrix change with the state.  Data are provided for
reproducing the analysis of exchange rates as in <EM> American
Economic Review, </EM> Sept. 1990. </P>
