<center>A letter from Private Secretary to the Duke of Hamilton</center><br>
<br>I have been asked by our Chief Executive to pass on some information to you in the hope that you could maybe pass it onto the rest of the Clan Hamilton Society members.<br>
 <br>
As I am sure you are all aware, Lennoxlove House is current undergoing an extensive refurbishment programme which involves the House being closed from January 2006 until July 2007.  The whole House is currently completely bare of furniture and furnishing and is shrouded in scaffolding at the present time.<br>
 <br>
From 1st August - 18th August 2006 there will be an Exhibition entitled "Treasures of Lennoxlove" at Lyon and Turnbull's Showroom at 33 Broughton Place, Edinburgh.  The Exhibition will be open from 11am - 5pm every day apart from Sundays.  It is a free Exhibition and we thought that maybe if any of your members found themselves in Edinburgh during that period, they may be interested in visiting the Exhibition.  On display will be some of the important paintings and pieces of furniture from within the Hamilton Collection and of course the Death Mask, the Mary, Queen of Scots ring and Silver Casket.<br>
 <br>
I hope all is well with you and thank you for your help.  If you would like any more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br>

    <h2>Excavating
    a Scottish rebel’s luxurious stronghold - Cadzow Castle</h2>
    <p><a name="item5" href="http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/news.shtml">From
    British Archaeology website&nbsp;</a></p>
    <p>Excavations this year at Cadzow Castle in Lanarkshire have shed light on
    the rise and fall of one of Scotland's great noble families of the 16th
    century.</p>
    <p>Cadzow, one of the seats of the Hamilton family, was built in the 1520s
    or 1530s by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, a military engineer and architect
    who was Master of the King's Works for James V. However in 1579, during the
    reign of Mary, Queen of Scots - while Mary was imprisoned, and the country
    was ruled by regents on behalf of young James VI - the Hamiltons opposed the
    government and their castle was besieged. It has remained a ruin ever since.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the inner ward was a large mound, which this year's dig
    has revealed covers the remains of a tower house - the castle's main
    building. Great chunks of masonry, including doorways and the tops of walls,
    were found upside-down, with evidence of burning, indicating that the castle
    had been blown to pieces by the attacking forces. According to Peter Yeoman,
    of Historic Scotland which sponsored the dig, it was 'most unusual' to
    attempt complete demolition in such circumstances. 'This shows how
    determined the regent's forces were to suppress the power of the Hamiltons.'</p>
    <p>The castle had been built fit for a king. About 800 fragments of
    luxurious green-glazed floor tiles were found, impressed with the letters J
    and M, probably representing King James V and one of his wives (either
    Madeleine or Mary). Identical tiles - from the same kiln, even the same
    firing - had been used to floor a principal chamber at the royal palace of
    Linlithgow some 20 miles away, where Sir James Hamilton was carrying out
    works. It seems likely that the noble architect appropriated any unused
    tiles from Linlithgow for use in his own home.</p>
    <p>During the 18th century, Cadzow Castle was incorporated as a romantic
    ruin into the grounds of nearby Hamilton Palace, the main seat of the Dukes
    of Hamilton (whose fortunes by then had revived). However, in the mid-20th
    century Hamilton Palace itself became derelict when its owners could no
    longer afford the maintenance costs It is now the site of a trading estate
    and shopping mall called 'Hamilton Palace' on the outskirts of Hamilton
    town.&nbsp;

  <p>The Hamilton Genealogical Society has organized a DNA project for the male
  line of the Hamilton family. The DNA project uses DNA markers from the male Y chromosome
  (reason for males only) to trace family origins. This project can provide
  valuable clues to possible linkage to various families past those in
  documented&nbsp; form.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For the latest results visit site &nbsp;<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/g/a/gah4/HamDNA/Results.html">Latest
  Hamilton DNA Results.</a></p>
  <p>Some highlights of the current summary are the following. Results are given
  for over 70 participants. About two thirds of the participants can be placed
  in one of seven different groups (A to G) with reasonably close matches within
  each group. Groups A and B are the most populous with about half of all
  participants in one or the other of these groups. The Group D participants are
  all documented descendants of Alexander Hamilton, a USA founding father and
  first secretary of the treasury, so his DNA profile is now known. Most of the
  participants were not aware of any relationship to other participants so those
  who match others in the various groups now have new avenues to explore the
  derivation of their lines. Thus, I would like to encourage each of you to
  consider participating in the project because it may help you unravel details
  of your Hamilton line.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Most of these participants were previously unaware
  of the relationships that the DNA results turned up. As we obtain more results
  we are beginning to see relationships among several people with known
  ancestors from Ireland, Scotland, and the early American colonies. Thus, each
  of you is encouraged to consider having your Hamilton line DNA analyzed; the
  more participants we have, the more possibilities for finding new
  relationships and extending the knowledge of your Hamilton line. To make it
  easier to participate, the application procedure has been<br>
  simplified and streamlined; visit (<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/g/a/gah4/HamDNA/H1.html">Hamilton DNA Project</a>)
  for details.</p>
  <p>Check it out. And if you are a male with the Hamilton surname, consider
  participation in the program. The more participants that we have the better we
  will be able to understand the results.</p>
  <p>Further information about the Hamilton DNA project can be found at the
  web site for <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/g/a/gah4/HamDNA/H1.html">Hamilton DNA Project</a>.
