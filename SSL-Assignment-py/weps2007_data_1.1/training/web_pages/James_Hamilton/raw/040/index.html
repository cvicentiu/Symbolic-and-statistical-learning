              Hamilton was a Union soldier assigned to duty at Fort Delaware from

              distaste for the hardships suffered in the line of duty, and a rather

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in 1835 
              in Virginia, Hamilton moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania after the 
              death of his father. His family exemplified the duality that reverberated 
              in the conflict between the North and South. Soon after the war 
              broke out, Alexander's oldest brother, John, loyal to his Virginian 
              roots, joined with the Confederacy. He went into battle and was 
              never heard from again.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1862, 26-year 
              -old Alexander was working as a clerk in a store in Pittsburgh when 
              he and his brother, Alfred, decided to enlist together in the Union 
              Army, probably spurred into action by the surprising victories by 
              the Southern army in the first year of the war. Both were assigned 
              to Independent Battery G in the Pittsburgh Heavy Artillery. He was 
              sent directly to Fort Delaware, though there is no mention in his 
              writings of whether or not his brother accompanied him. After the 
              war, Hamilton returned to Pittsburgh and taught school. He married, 
              and fathered nine children. He was killed by a train while walking 
              home along its tracks in 1897.</font></p>

        and discharged a cargo of Johnny Rebs. I was detailed for guard duty for 
        the first time and I was about as awkward as I could be, could scarcely 
        come to shoulder arms, having never been on drill in my life. However

        and got along pretty well until 1 o'clock at night when in the dark I 
        fell off a narrow plank into the river, lost my gun and cap, knocked another 
        man's gun into the river and lost it. At 2 a.m. I was back at my post 
        and stood until 9. Got my own gun out of the river, went to quarters where 
        Boggs and I had a little fuss but nothing but a little swearing was done.

        so strong and boisterous, McMyers also wild, John Thomas very sick but 
        not crazy, many of the other boys sick but not so bad as these. The disease

        tried to get sleep, but the noise prevented it. Read until noon, was then 
        detailed to go with six others to take the dead body of Tharp to Delaware 
        City. We deposited the body in the Dead House then went to the Whiskey 
        House and took a drink. We wanted to stop a while on account of New Year's 
        but Lt. Young couldn't see it and we were marched on board the boat and 
        had a pleasant trip. Got up a dance in quarters and were happy until Taps

        (good time) then at Gettys, Boyd's, Ayers, got our rations then started 
        for the depot. Got into conversation with the captain of the guard to 
        avoid being asked for papers.</font></font></p>

        <font color="#336699">There is not much going on today. I am inside most 
        of the day playing cards. Went down to Mrs. Patterson's at 8 p.m. Some 
        7 or 8 Irish girls are there, a dozen boys and two fiddles, we conclude 
        to be jolly, went to dancing, kept up till morning but had two quarrels 
        and came near to bursting up. The wind is blowing at a fearful rate and 
        it is the coldest night of the season. I went out at 2 o'clock and stayed 
        until 4 then went back to the party.</font></font></p>
