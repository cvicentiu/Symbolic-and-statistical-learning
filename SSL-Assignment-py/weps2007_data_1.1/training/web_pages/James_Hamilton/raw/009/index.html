<p><font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Esteemed by his peers
as &quot;our ablest marine painter,&quot; James Hamilton won fame
as an artist who, &quot;in his best works, exhibited the higher
mental powers of the poet, as well as rare technical skill.&quot;
Born in Entrien, near Belfast, Ireland, Hamilton emigrated with
his family to the United States in <i>1834, </i>settling in
Philadelphia. He exhibited his first paintings six years later,
having secured instruction in drawing along with advice from
older artists and lessons from engravings and books. Philadelphia
boasted a strong tradition of marine painting in the figure of
Thomas Birch (1779-1851), from whom Hamilton likely drew
inspiration. Hamilton also learned of the contemporary school of
English landscape painters through printed sources. His
admiration for Samuel Prout and J. M. W. Turner was established
well before 1854<i>, </i>the year Hamilton traveled to England
and had the opportunity to study those artists' work directly.<br>
By 1850<i> </i>Hamilton had demonstrated a proclivity for marine
subjects. While selling and receiving commissions for paintings,
he also worked as an illustrator. Between 1853<i> </i>and 1856<i>
</i>he collaborated on publications by the arctic explorer Elisha
Kent Kane, transforming rough field sketches into artful
illustrations. Continuing to work out of Philadelphia, Hamilton
apparently traveled no farther north than Boston in search of
coastline scenery. Literature, engravings, and poetic imagination
inspired his paintings of foreign coasts and historic naval
battles, images which Hamilton animated with distinctive
brushwork and dramatic color.<br>
In 1875<i> </i>Hamilton sold most of his books, engravings,
sketches, and paintings, anticipating a journey around the world.
Arriving in San Francisco the next year, he received a warm
welcome from the artistic community there. He was still in San
Francisco when he died unexpectedly in 1878<i>.<br>
From Sail to Steam </i>may well record a view looking west across
the swells of the Pacific Ocean. Yet the very absence of
landmarks in Hamilton's painting<b> </b>serves to underline the
central role of light. The long,<b> </b>hot rays of a dying sun,
stretching across the water<b> </b>below a low horizon, gently
and gradually coloring the sky above, align Hamilton with the
luminist tradition in American landscape painting. This same
light, however, divides the composition vertically, recalling the
legacy of Turner. Likewise, the choppy waves suggest an
underlying turbulence antithetical to luminist repose. Contrasts
beloved by the earlier Romantics still linger: the dark sea<b> </b>below
an atmospheric sky; two white<b> </b>birds,<b> </b>one above, one
below the horizon; weighty steamers, pushing into the wind with
their sails furled, juxtaposed against small and spritely craft
with their sails open. The title <i>From Sail to Steam is </i>not
one that Hamilton would have given to this painting, but the
phrase still suggests its central theme: the passage of time and
the undeniably altered mood of post-Civil War America, blessed
with technological prowess but nostalgic for innocence lost.<br>
