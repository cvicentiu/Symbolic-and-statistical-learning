        Alexander Hamilton was one of the most influential of the United
        States' founding fathers. As the first secretary of the treasury
        he placed the new nation on a firm financial footing, and although
        his advocacy of strong national government brought him into bitter
        conflict with <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/TJEFFERS.HTM">Thomas Jefferson</A> and
        others, his political philosophy was ultimately to prevail in
        governmental development. Hamilton's own career was terminated
        prematurely when he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804.</CENTER></TD>

    <P><CENTER>Hamilton was born on the West Indian island of Nevis,
    probably in 1755. Since he was the illegitimate son of Rachel
    Fawcett Lavien and James Hamilton, both of West Indian trading
    families, his exact birth date and the circumstances of his early
    life are difficult to determine. Modern research has established,
    however, that he was probably not born in 1757, as he and his
    children supposed; that he spent his youth mostly on the island
    of Saint Croix apprenticed as a clerk; and that in 1772 he was
    sent to New York City by his guardian, the merchant Nicholas
    Cruger.<BR>
<BR>
    Hamilton was obviously precocious, and his guardian sought to
    enroll him in the College of New Jersey at Princeton. When refused
    permission there to accelerate his program of studies, he enrolled
    instead at King's College (now Columbia University), New York
    City, in 1773 or 1774. In 1774-75, when he was not yet 20, he
    entered the growing dispute between the American colonies and
    the British government by writing many fervent tracts filled
    with doctrines of rebellion and natural rights derived from the
    philosopher John Locke.<BR>
<BR>
    Hamilton's bent, however, was toward action, so he enlisted in
    the militia and fought in the battles around New York City in
    1775 and 1776. His zeal and organizing ability brought him to
    <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/GWASH.HTM">George Washington's</A> attention and led
    to a commission, in March 1777, as lieutenant colonel in the
    <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/CONTAR.HTM">Continental Army</A> and aide-de-camp to
    its commander. He served with Washington for four years. Though
    admired as a superb staff officer, Hamilton longed for a field
    command, which he achieved in time to lead a regiment of New
    York troops at the <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/YORK.HTM">Battle of Yorktown</A>
    in October 1781.<BR>
<BR>
    Hamilton's personal life and social position in the new nation
    took a decisive turn in December 1780, when he married Elizabeth
    Schuyler, daughter of the wealthy and influential General Philip
    Schuyler. This connection placed Hamilton in the center of New
    York society. In 1782, shortly after leaving the army, he was
    admitted to legal practice in New York and became assistant to
    Robert Morris (1734-1806), who was then superintendent of finance.
    Well before his 30th birthday, then, Hamilton had had a distinguished
    military career, knew intimately most of the leaders of the American
    Revolution, had achieved high social standing, and was recognized
    as one of the leading lawyers in the country.<BR>

<BR>
    Elected a member of the <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/CONGRESS.HTM">Continental Congress</A>
    in 1782, Hamilton at once became a leading proponent of a stronger
    national government than that provided for by the Articles of
    Confederation. As aide to Washington he had observed the debilitating
    effect of &quot;an uncontrollable sovereignty in each state&quot;
    and called repeatedly for a strengthened Congress and more efficient
    executive departments. As a New York delegate to the Constitutional
    Convention of 1787, he advocated a national government that would
    have virtually abolished the states and even called for a president-for-life
    to provide energetic leadership. He left the convention at the
    end of June, but he approved the Constitution subsequently drafted
    by his colleagues as preferable to the Articles, though it was
    not as strong as he wished it to be.<BR>
<BR>
    With John Jay and <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/MADISON.HTM">James Madison</A>, Hamilton
    wrote a series of papers (published in book form as The Federalist,
    1788) urging the people of New York to ratify the new constitution.
    His brilliant essays on the need for a stronger union, the utility
    of a national taxing power, and the importance of the executive
    and judicial branches of the federal government became classic
    statements of his political philosophy of strong leadership in
    the public interest. At the New York ratifying convention of
    June-July 1788, Hamilton and his allies defeated the previously
    dominant antifederal forces in the state.</CENTER></TD>

        <P><CENTER>&nbsp;Hamilton was the obvious choice to be the first
        secretary of the treasury under the new constitution. Holding
        this office from Sept. 11, 1789, to Jan. 31, 1795, he proved
        himself a brilliant administrator both in organizing the Treasury
        Department and in assisting generally to set guidelines for and
        staff all the departments of government. &nbsp;Most notably,
        however, he sent reports to Congress on the public credit and
        on the national bank. Hamilton argued that if the nation was
        to grow and prosper, its credit would have to be sound to encourage
        both foreign and domestic investment.</CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER>He proposed, therefore, to pay the nation's debts
    in full and also to assume the unpaid debts of the various states.
    He urged this candidly as a means of both diminishing the fiscal
    importance of the states and cementing the loyalty of wealthy
    commercial interests to the federal government. With the nation's
    economy thus buttressed and biased toward commerce, Hamilton
    proposed that a national bank be established to help the federal
    government manage the nation's trade and finance. These proposals
    were accepted by Congress, and the Bank of the United States
    was chartered in 1791. His recommendations for a broad range
    of tariffs and bounties to stimulate the growth of manufacturing
    were not adopted at this time, however.</CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER>Hamilton's plans were so comprehensive and so brilliantly
    useful to commercial expansion that he aroused the opposition
    of Madison, Jefferson, and others who believed that such a strong
    government, informally allied as it was with the worldwide trading
    dominance of Great Britain, would subordinate agriculture and
    subvert the republican ideals of the American Revolution. Scorning
    the Jeffersonians as timid and backward-looking, Hamilton, with
    Washington's continuing support, organized a congressional majority
    for his policies.</CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER>He then took the lead in urging rapprochement with
    Great Britain, which culminated in Jay's Treaty (1794), and in
    firmly suppressing the so-called Whiskey Rebellion (1794), which
    was provoked by his excise taxes. By the time he retired from
    the Treasury Department in 1795, he had established the administrative
    and policy foundations of the new government, articulated a philosophy
    of &quot;loose construction&quot; of the Constitution, and founded,
    informally, the conservative Federalist Party as the instrument
    of his intentions.<BR>

        <P><CENTER>&nbsp;On leaving the government Hamilton resumed a
        busy and lucrative law practice. He continued to have a strong
        influence in the public councils, however. He supported a defiant
        posture toward France during the XYZ Affair (1798), and as inspector
        general of the army (1798-1800) he took charge of organizing
        the nation's defenses. Bitterly disappointed in <A HREF="http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/ADAMS.HTM">President
        John Adam's</A> erratic leadership, Hamilton openly opposed Adams's
        reelection in 1800. When it appeared, however, that Aaron Burr
        might win the presidency over Jefferson, Hamilton unhesitatingly
        threw his support to Jefferson, whose policies he scorned, rather
        than to Burr, whom he regarded as a man without principles.</CENTER></TD>

    <P><CENTER>This and other opposition by Hamilton so frustrated
    and angered Burr that he challenged Hamilton to a duel. The two
    men fought at Weehawken, N.J., on July 11, 1804. Hamilton apparently
    fired into the air, but Burr took direct aim. Hamilton fell mortally
    wounded and died the next day in New York. He was buried in Trinity
    churchyard, New York City. He left his wife and seven children
    heavily in debt, but friends soon paid off the debts. Hamilton
    was mourned by his countrymen as one who had devoted his life
    to the nation's growth in freedom and prosperity.</CENTER></TD>
