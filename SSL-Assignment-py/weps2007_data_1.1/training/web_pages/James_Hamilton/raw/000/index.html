<p><a href="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/daily_shocks.pdf">Daily Monetary Policy Shocks and the Delayed Response of New Home Sales</a>.  This paper argues that a change in the fed funds target begins to affect the economy as soon as it becomes anticipated by markets, with innovations in mortgage rates driven in part by innovations in the level and slope of the term structure of expected near-horizon fed funds rates.  Despite this instantaneous anticipatory response of mortgage rates, the consequences for housing of a change in monetary policy are drawn out over a long period of time due to heterogeneity across households in time required to purchase a home.  This framework facilitates detailed measurement and interpretation of the time lags relating monetary policy to the housing market, and motivates a daily index that can be used to summarize the current and future economic implications of recent Fed policy changes.  I've also written two articles summarizing this paper for a more general audience: 
<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/11/federal_reserve.html">[1]</a>,
<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/11/mortgage_rates.html">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/daily_ff.pdf">Daily Changes in Fed Funds Futures Prices</a>.  Originally part of the preceding paper, this is now split off as a separate study documenting the time series properties of daily changes in the prices of fed funds futures contracts.  The paper finds these contracts to be excellent predictors of the fed funds rate.  Although some violations of the martingale hypothesis are uncovered, the economic significance of these for daily price changes appears to be quite small.  An article summarizing this paper for a general audience is available at

<P>One application of my research has been new algorithms for determining
when economic recessions begin and end.  This originated with my
1989 article in <A href="index.html#econometrica"> Econometrica.</a> Data and software
used in these methods can be accessed <a href="http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/software.htm#Markov" </a>
