<B><FONT FACE="ARIAL" >Acts of Reading: Exploring Connections in Pedagogy of Japanese</B><B> </B><br><I>NARA Hiroshi & NODA Mari.</I> With essays by Charles Quinn, Fumiko Harada & Chris Brockett<br>Hawaii University Press Honolulu 2002 1st Edition <br>Hardback/Cloth 352pp 230 x 155mm, 30 illustrations. ISBN 0824822617 <B>AU$125.00 </B>[t]<p><FONT SIZE=2>[Indent] Students who have completed a year of German read Brecht in their second year, those of Spanish read Cervantes. Teachers of first and second-year Japanese can often find nothing comparable. 'Why aren't your students reading literature?' they are asked. 'Why not Soseki? Or Murakami?' What are instructors of Japanese doing wrong? <BR>  <BR> Nothing, according to the authors of this volume. Rather, they argue, such questions exemplify the gross misunderstandings and unreasonable expectations of teaching reading in Japanese. In <B><I>Acts of Reading</I></B>, the authors set out to explore what reading is for Japanese as a language, and how instructors should teach it to students of Japanese. They seek answers to two questions: What are the aspects of reading in Japan as manifested in Japanese society? What L2 (second-language) reading problems are specific to Japanese? In answering the first and related questions, the authors conclude that reading is a socially motivated, purposeful act that is savoured and becomes a part of people's lives. Reading instruction in Japanese, therefore, should include teaching students how to work with text as the Japanese do in Japanese society. <BR>  <BR> The second question relates more directly to traditional concerns in L2 reading. The authors begin with a general theory of reading. They then offer a welcome glimpse into the rich and complex perspectives - sometimes conflicting, other times symbiotic - on what reading is and how it is performed in L1 and L2, and, most importantly, on the web of interconnections between the phenomenology of reading and the demands it places on teaching approaches to reading in Japanese. <BR>  <BR> <B>Hiroshi Nara</B> is associate professor of Japanese language and linguistics in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh. <B>Mari Noda</B> is associate professor of Japanese in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at Ohio State University.</FONT><p>[To order this item, please quote 18086]</FONT></TR>

How do I communicate happiness, surprise, or anger? How do others communicate these emotions to me? Such questions become increasingly relevant as we become more competent in the language we are learning. <B><I>Expressive Japanese</I></B> is the first detailed guide to emotion words and expressive strategies for students of the language. Words connoting feelings, such as '<I>kanashii</I>' (sad), are important in everyday Japanese conversation, but communicating emotions effectively also requires the use of expressive strategies, such as '<I>Nani</I>?' (What the heck?), '<I>Yattaa</I>!' (I did it!), or '<I>Hottoite</I>!' (Leave me alone!). <BR>   <BR> Introductory chapters examine the characteristics, constraints, and history of expressive Japanese and discuss linguistic variations and styles and how these play a part in conveying emotion and empathy. There follow more than seventy entries that draw on hundreds of authentic examples taken from a variety of sources, including television dramas, comics, interviews, novels, essays, newspaper articles, and web sites. In these examples, students will find playful and creative uses of expressions that do not usually appear in language textbooks. English cues and key Japanese expressions are indexed at the back of the volume, making this a handy reference for anyone who possesses a grasp of the fundamentals of elementary Japanese.  <BR>  <BR> Based on extensive research by a prominent linguist and teacher, <B><I>Expressive Japanese</I></B> brings learners into the world of real human interaction and effectively illustrates how native speakers use language to convey identity and a sense of self as well as to communicate feelings and emotion.  <BR>  <BR> <B>Senko Maynard</B> is Professor II of Japanese language and linguistics at Rutgers University.</FONT><p>[To order this item, please quote 23354]</FONT></TR>

How do I communicate happiness, surprise, or anger? How do others communicate these emotions to me? Such questions become increasingly relevant as we become more competent in the language we are learning. <B><I>Expressive Japanese</I></B> is the first detailed guide to emotion words and expressive strategies for students of the language. Words connoting feelings, such as '<I>kanashii</I>' (sad), are important in everyday Japanese conversation, but communicating emotions effectively also requires the use of expressive strategies, such as '<I>Nani</I>?' (What the heck?), '<I>Yattaa</I>!' (I did it!), or '<I>Hottoite</I>!' (Leave me alone!). <BR>   <BR> Based on extensive research by a prominent linguist and teacher, <B><I>Expressive Japanese</I></B> brings learners into the world of real human interaction and effectively illustrates how native speakers use language to convey identity and a sense of self as well as to communicate feelings and emotion.  <BR>  <BR> <B>Senko Maynard</B> is Professor II of Japanese language and linguistics at Rutgers University.</FONT><p>[To order this item, please quote 23355]</FONT></TR>

It will serve well as self-study material for students of Korean (or even for native Koreans studying English) or as a teacher reference for lesson planning'</I> - <B>Acta Koreana 2</B> (1999) <BR>  <BR> Vocabulary learning is the single most important component of second-language acquisition. In cases where the second language is unrelated to the learner's native tongue, this task presents special challenges because there are typically few clues in a word's form to assist in learning and remembering its meaning. This book offers a solution to this problem for students of Korean. <BR>  <BR> The <I><B>Handbook</B></I> is the first ever 'root dictionary' of Korean designed for second-language learners. Useful for students at all levels, it contains more than 1,500 vocabulary lists consisting of words built from a shared root. These lists offer a unique and efficient way for students to acquire new words. Upon encountering a word, students can consult the lists for its component roots and discover many other semantically related words built from the same elements. <BR>  <BR> An introduction provides an overview of Korean vocabulary and detailed instructions on how to use the word lists. A pronunciation guide outlines the major principles determining the pronunciation of compounds and other multipart words in Korean.</FONT><p>[To order this item, please quote 18548]</FONT></TR>
