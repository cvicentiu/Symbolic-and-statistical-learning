I would like to thank Teresa Wilmott (UCSD Lab for Neuropsychology)
and Michael J. Posner (University of Oregon) for their help with the
language and brain references I sought on linguist list a few days
ago. The bibliographical data below was provided by Professor Posner
in response to a personal query. I am passing it along because it may
be of interest some Linguist subscribers.

For the study of lateralization in bilinguals:

Weber-Fox, C. M., &amp; Neville, H. J. (in press). Maturational
constraints on functional specializations for language processing: ERP
and behavioral evidence in bilingual speakers. Journal of Cognitive
Neuroscience.

Teresa Wilmott (The work was done at her lab.) provides the
information that &quot;this ERP study is both syntactic and semantic and is
done with Chinese immigrants.&quot; She adds: &quot;They just got video taped
for CNN for this very study.&quot; (It may be something to watch out for --
Chris)

Professor Posner provides references to two further forthcoming
studies by Helen Neville and others that may be of interest:

Neville, H. J., Corina, D., Bavelier, D., Clark, V. P., Jezzard, P.,
Prinster, A., Padmanabhan, S., Braun, A., Rauschecker, J., &amp; Turner,
R. (1995). Effects of early experience on cerebral organization for
language: An fMRI study of sentence processing in English and ASL by
hearing and deaf subjects. Proceedings of the First International
Conference on Functional Mapping on the Human Brain, 1, p. 143. [page
# may be incorrect]

Neville, H. J., Coffey, S. A., Lawson, D. S., Fischer, A., Emmorey,
K., &amp; Bellugi, U. (in press). Neural systems mediating American Sign
Language: Effects of sensory experience and age of acquisition. Brain
and Language.


The maturational study of reading and brain wave forms that I referred
to in my query is apparently to be found in:

Posner, M.I., Abdullaev, Y.G., McCandliss, B.D., Sereno, S.C. (1995).
Anatomy, circuitry and plasticity of high level human skills. Visual
and attentional processes in reading and dyslexia London: Routledge.


Cheers.
