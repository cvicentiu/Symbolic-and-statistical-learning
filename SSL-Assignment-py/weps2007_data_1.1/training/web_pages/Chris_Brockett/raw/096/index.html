<h2 class="title">Doings in Dublin</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>IJET-14, the 2003 International Japanese/English Translation Conference: sponsored by the Japan Association of Translators&#059; a gathering of colleagues and friends from all over the globe&#059; 24 thought-provoking sessions&#059; Irish hospitality. Look for the Kobe rendition in 2004.
</p></div>
<p>One of the many nice things about the annual IJET Conferences is the chance to see friends old and new. This year in Dublin was no exception. And because these people are not only friends but part of the very supportive J/E translation community, the few days we had were not enough. I&#8217;m already looking forward to Kobe next June.</p>

<p>The conference &#8220;started&#8221; with a pre-conference reception at the Old Jameson Distillery, where we heard how Irish whiskey is made&#8212;including what distinguishes it from Scotch and other lesser beverages&#8212;and ended up with a tasting session, comparing several Jameson products to a common Scotch and a bourbon. Then there was a sit-down dinner accompanied by lively live Irish music and dancing. You will excuse me if I do not remember what time this ended.</p>

<p>The formal program began the next day, May 17. As has become the custom, there were several concurrent sessions in each time slot, with the slots separated by ample time to talk over danish and coffee. Excellent arrangements. The schedule, minus times and room names, looked like this:</p>

</p>
<p>Obviously no one person could go to all of the sessions, and that is why we&#8212;including the people who had to miss Dublin for one reason or another&#8212;are looking forward to the <em>Proceedings</em>. And because <em>Proceedings</em> there will be, I am only going to touch very lightly on some of the highlights of the sessions I attended (the starred sessions).</p>

<p>Wilson noted that business translation is an important source of income for many people. After reviewing the state of the field and the need to read widely to stay current, she offered a few general J-to-E principles: don&#8217;t overuse the passive voice, keep it brief and to the point (without worrying about mirroring the number of sentences in the source text), check titles and other proper nouns, and consider the reading audience&#8217;s needs. Good advice even if you do not do annual reports and the like.</p>

<p>Fingleton argues that the Japanese economy is doing very well and that we should not be taken in by the press reports of its near-demise. In support of his thesis, he cited a few industries where Japanese firms are dominant players. And he said that the misleading press reports are part of a sinister conspiracy by people who do not share the Judeo-Christian truth ethic. Needless to say, I found him singularly unpersuasive.</p>

<p>Parish described the translation work that the World Intellectual Property Organization does to protect intellectual property. Surprisingly&#8212;or perhaps not surprisingly, given that it is an extremely Eurocentric body&#8212;they have a very small J/E team and have to outsource most of the work, including the abstracts, the international search reports, and about half of the international preliminary examination reports. She also described the WIPO in general and made her work in Geneva sound very interesting.</p>

<p>Wakabayashi surveyed the way translation and translators are depicted in fiction&#8212;some of it written by people who are themselves translators. Two things stand out. Because translators straddle cultures, they are suspect in both. And also because of this transcultural straddle, they are assumed to have great identity crises. (Am I an American? Or am I Japanese? For example.) A third theme is marginality, as translators are thought to be mere conduits performing uncreative work. These are the perceptions the public starts with.</p>

<p>Day two started for me with Doki, who picked up some of the more interesting literary devices in Joyce&#8217;s epic, explained what they mean and how they evolve during the day, and then looked at how they have been translated. In characterizing the work as a whole, he said Joyce purposely rejected the idea of plot and opted instead for profuse detail, in keeping with his belief that history is not some grand procession toward a divine goal but is simply noise in the street.</p>

<p>Mitamura said the three goals are to (1) automatically turn out (2) quality translation (3) in a wide range of fields but that machine translation is currently only able to do any two of the three. After a brief overview of the field, she explained the work that Carnegie Mellon University is doing with controlled language&#8212;restricting the source text&#8217;s naturalness to reduce ambiguity and facilitate machine translation&#8212;and the results it is achieving in heavy machinery manuals. This was a very interesting companion to Chris Brockett&#8217;s presentation last year at IJET-13.</p>

<p>In the next-to-last session, O&#8217;Hagan urged translators to get out of the printed-word box and to consider all of the many other determinants of communication&#8212;and then to think about how we can also translate them. In effect, she urged language support to go digital. Part of this is localization&#8212;where the goal is for routine work that is scalable and repeatable and that produces standardized quality&#8212;but it is much more than that. Can text and graphic be separated? Does the graphic translate? Translatability editors need to be involved in the source material&#8217;s creation. And translators need to look at new technologies&#8212;such as &#8220;interpreting&#8221; a chat session on the Web or using virtual reality tools to convey the fullness of meaning. Word processing and Internetting have revolutionized the field over the last 30 years or so, but there is no reason to assume this revolution is over.</p>

<p>Finally, the conference program closed with a roundtable discussion on translation business models. To incorporate or not? To work solo or as part of a large&#8212;how large?&#8212;team? What to do and what to outsource? Much of this was nation (i.e., legal system) specific, but there was also the very interesting suggestion that translators get away from the idea of working for agencies and think about employing agents themselves. While it may look inconsequential as stated, such a reversal could change the shape of the industry with major implications for the translator and translation in general. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to discuss this in detail. Perhaps at IJET-15.</p>

<p>Then the formal conference was over, and we were left to enjoy some more of Dublin&#8217;s great hospitality before heading home with a suitcase full of dirty laundry and a mind full of fresh ideas and pleasant memories. Many thanks to JAT for holding this annual inspiration.

<h2 class="title">Kanji Core Meanings, Software Lexicons</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>Launching &#8220;SWET on Saturdays,&#8221; Jack Halpern told how one student of Japanese wound up creating a Japanese-English character dictionary and massive Chinese, Japanese, and Korean lexical databases now used to aid Internet search engines.
</p></div>
<p>Starting with an encounter with a Japanese language textbook on an Israeli kibbutz, the story of how one man&#8217;s fascination with kanji led to sixteen years of toil to produce the <em>New Japanese-English Character Dictionary</em> (Kenkyusha, 1990) and then to creating lexicons for computers was far too much material for a two-hour SWET presentation on a Saturday afternoon. But on February 22 we made a start, as Jack Halpern explained that his dictionary is aimed at mastering the meaning of kanji and discussed how his years of study of the core meanings of Chinese characters led him to work in the highly specialized area of lexicography for databases and Internet search engines.</p>

<p>Even the busiest translator who dares not dally long in pursuit of kanji readings and meanings would find it difficult to resist the delight Halpern takes in exploring the meanings of characters that form the shared orthography of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (the CJK sphere). Polyglot Halpern speaks or reads twelve languages and is working on his thirteenth (Arabic), but Japanese is his all-absorbing favorite. After completing the dictionary, which has been published in a variety of editions, he founded the CJK Dictionary Institute, Inc., and now presides over a database of some six million entries.</p>

<p>
<p>The challenge of learning kanji inspired Halpern&#8217;s twenty-eight-year career as a CJK lexicographer, and he is well versed in the fine lines that distinguish the some two hundred readings of the character &#29983; and the characters used for such homophones as <em>kaeru</em> (&#24112;&#12427;, &#22793;&#12360;&#12427;, &#26367;&#12360;&#12427;, &#25563;&#12360;&#12427;, &#20195;&#12360;&#12427;, etc.). He is also a student of the formation of such compounds as <em>keizai</em> (from the phrase <em>keikoku saimin</em> &#32076;&#22269;&#28168;&#27665; &#8220;administering the country and relieving the sufferings of the people") that testify to the often arduous history of words coined for concepts and inventions arising during the Meiji era (1868-1912). He noted that those efforts went far&#059; many Japanese-coined compounds were exported to China, where they are still in use.</p>

<p>If you think that kanji-English dictionaries exist only for finding words, Halpern&#8217;s stout defense of a dictionary focusing on &#8220;understanding the components of meaning&#8221; is worth lingering over. The <em>New Japanese-English Character Dictionary</em> is a monument to the appreciation of kanji and in-depth character meanings. Unlike Nelson&#8217;s <em>Modern Reader&#8217;s Japanese-English Character Dictionary,</em> his dictionary, Halpern stresses, is not meant to &#8220;look up words&#8221; but to make learning kanji easier and more logical. Once you understand the core meaning of a character and its elements, he believes, you will find that kanji are easy to learn. How the dictionary works and what it offers, including the SKIP method of locating characters, can best be understood by examining the dictionary itself.</p>

<p>Halpern touched on the work of Professor Hashimoto Mantaro, who conducted a government-funded study of Japanese and a number of other languages and arrived at the perhaps surprising conclusion that &#8220;Japanese is easier to read than any other language.&#8221; Asked what they thought of this notion, a number in the audience agreed. Halpern explained that the key lies in the heterogeneity of the script, combining hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Studies by Kaiho Hiroyuki at Tsukuba University show how kanji are processed by the brain and demonstrate why Japanese can be called &#8220;easy to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halpern noted that the complexity of kanji can be an aid to learning. As has been demonstrated in research on early education, children have been shown to learn even highly complex kanji more quickly than hiragana, many of which appear somewhat similar. Halpern used an eighty-four-stroke character, the name of a Buddhist prelate consisting of a tiny constellation of the characters for &#8220;cloud&#8221; and &#8220;dragon,&#8221; as an example and said that we would probably not forget it, even though we had seen it only once.</p>

<p>Japanese texts using a traditional mix of kanji, katakana, and hiragana may be easy to read, but the recent proliferation of katakana words, said Halpern, has made Japanese harder to read, particularly in much-maligned software and other technical manuals. He decried the faddish use of katakana words when there are perfectly good Japanese words and kanji, for example, <em>erub&#333;</em> &#12456;&#12523;&#12508;&#12540; for &#8220;elbow&#8221; instead of <em>hiji</em> &#32920; and <em>shorudaa</em> &#12471;&#12519;&#12523;&#12480;&#12540; for &#8220;shoulder&#8221; instead of <em>kata</em> &#32937;.</p>

<p>In the final half hour of the meeting, Halpern discussed the work of the CJK Dictionary Institute (Nitch&#363;kan Jiten Kenky&#363;jo), the name of which is written in characters still common to the three languages, despite many changes in orthography in China, Japan, and Korea. At the institute, he and his colleagues are creating custom databases of words and characters for computer systems and language-processing systems. Among the institute&#8217;s clients is Babylon, a provider of online translation tools. CJKI also serves as a consultant to Google, whose Chinese and Japanese search engines are powered by CJKI&#8217;s large-scale databases. It also provides databases designed to enhance the internal dictionaries of computational linguistics tools, such as machine translation software and morphological analyzers.</p>

<p>On a recent trip to present his work in China, Halpern found very receptive audiences on a lecture tour of several universities. He is also involved in work relating to &#8220;lexicon-based orthographic disambiguation,&#8221; which seeks to enable search engines to understand the variety of ways in which the same sentence can be written in Japanese. He showed a chart of twenty-four ways to write the sentence &#8220;Kin no tamago o umu niwatori&#8221; (a chicken that laid the golden egg) using combinations of syllabic characters and kanji. His current challenge is to develop a system for orthographic processing to enable search engines to find what is needed no matter what the orthography used.</p>

<h2 class="title">Reading Japanese Advertising</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>What does it mean to understand an ad? And what specifically does it mean to understand a Japanese ad? The ads we examine are more than an opportunity to learn about Japanese advertising&#059; they are also an opportunity to learn something about the society in which those ads were produced.
</p></div>
<p>When asked if I might be willing to contribute something to the <em>SWET Newsletter</em>, my mind turned instantly to a subject dear to all our hearts, Japanese advertising. We love it, we hate it, but one thing&#8217;s for sure: it&#8217;s hard to ignore. Sometimes we have to translate it. Sometimes we have to answer questions about it. Sometimes we present advertising proposals and have to make them sufficiently persuasive that clients will spend large sums of money to produce the ads and buy space in the media in which they appear.</p>

<p>
<p>All of these activities assume that we understand the ads. But what does it mean to understand an ad? And what specifically does it mean to understand a Japanese ad? These are the questions addressed in a seminar titled &#8220;The Making and Meaning of Advertising&#8221; that I teach each year at Sophia University. Every year, new groups of students (mostly European, some Asian, more rarely American, Japanese, or from other parts of the world) find new answers to these questions and improve on the ones found in previous years. Our knowledge deepens not only because fresh minds bring fresh viewpoints to the research but also, I believe, because our method addresses details in the ads instead of just generalizations about them.</p>

<h4>The Tokyo Copywriters Club Annual Ad Contest</h4>
<p>Our primary source is the latest edition of the <em>TCC Nenkan</em> (Tokyo Copywriters Club annual), a massive tome containing the winners of the Tokyo Copywriters Club&#8217;s annual ad contest. The sample is not unbiased. What we see is what the club&#8217;s panel of judges considered the best advertising produced in the previous year in Japan. The judges are advertising &#8220;creatives,&#8221; individuals who have succeeded in a highly competitive industry. They are members of a self-selected elite (the only way to become a club member is to win a prize). Like creatives everywhere, they tend to be more concerned with innovative thinking and artistic flair than account executives (who care more about whether clients can be persuaded to buy and produce ads) or marketing managers (who care more about whether products actually sell).</p>

<p>In addition to the bias in the sample, we confront another problem. My students invariably ask, &#8220;Did the campaign work?&#8221; I invariably respond, &#8220;How could we find out?&#8221; All that we really know from seeing these ads in the <em>TCC Nenkan</em> is that the judges awarded them prizes. Did they work in the marketplace? Did they sell products and services? Our primary source is silent on these issues.</p>

<p>We are in a situation not unlike that of the archaeologist who has opened a tomb and found an interesting collection of artifacts. Or perhaps a better analogy is a scholar who studies fragments of ancient texts. We can only look at the details of the samples we have before us, compare them with each other and with other collections, and try to imagine and reverse-engineer both the processes that created them and the impact they may have had.</p>

<p>We are, however, helped in this effort by the sheer size of our sample. Each year&#8217;s <em>TCC Nenkan</em> is filled with hundreds of ads. These are a subset of more than 4,000 entries, divided by industry into thirteen categories. These categories are broad, and any given category may include a wide variety of ads. In early 2003, for example, a researcher with an interest in cosmetics analyzed the ads in category D. She was startled to discover that, along with cosmetics, ads for pharmaceuticals, household cleaning products, and photographic film were included, since all are products of chemical process industries.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the best that we can hope for is to get a sense of the creative possibilities explored by Japanese ads in one particular year and ponder what they may tell us about the state of particular industries, the Japanese market, and Japanese society during the year in question. I suggest to my students that we begin analysis of an ad by quickly jotting down what first strikes us about it. These first impressions are vital, both for what we learn about the ads and for what we learn about ourselves through our reactions to them. Then we are ready to delve more deeply.</p>

<p>Step 1 is to reverse-engineer the communication strategy that informed the production of the ad. Who is the target? What is the advertiser&#8217;s objective? Simple name awareness, understanding of key sales points, an improved brand or corporate image, a reminder of an already well-known message, or motivation of the target group to try the product are all possibilities. What is the proposition? What is the single sentence that best sums up what the advertiser wants to say? What is the rationale for the ad? Why does the advertiser believe that communicating this proposition to that target will achieve the objective? What is the supporting argument? Which facts or images lend credence to the proposition from the target&#8217;s viewpoint?</p>

<p>Step 2 is to ask what the creatives added to this basic strategy. How do the words and images in the ad add value to the proposition and help to make the ad eye-catching, funny, dramatic, exciting, compelling, or, to some audience members, just plain dumb? In the terms defined by classical rhetoric, it is here that we move from the argument, a matter of facts and logic, to rhetoric proper, the use of tropes to manipulate audience emotions.</p>

<p>Step 3 is to compare the ad with others. It is important to note whether an ad is part of a larger campaign. Shared formats and taglines may indicate that an ad is not a one-time effort. Next, broaden the comparison to include competitors&#8217; ads. Here is where we find clues to issues and developments affecting the state of the industry and develop a sense of the range of creative possibilities acceptable in ads from that industry.</p>

<p>In step 4, we adopt a broader historical and sociological perspective. In his book <em>Culture and the Ad: Exploring Otherness in the World of Advertising,</em> anthropologist William M. O&#8217;Barr observes that historical or ethnographic distance affects the way we look at ads. It separates us from the original target audiences, directing our attention away from the product (which may seem to us only quaint or exotic) to the taken-for-granted background of values and social relationships that constitute a culture. For my students, the ads we examine are more than an opportunity to learn about Japanese advertising&#059; they are also an opportunity to learn something about the society in which those ads were produced.</p>

<h4>The KDDI Launch Campaign</h4>
<p>As an example, I will examine the <em>TCC Nenkan</em> 2001 Grand Prix winner, the KDDI launch campaign. First impressions suggest that the print and TV ads were from entirely different campaigns. The print ads catch the eye with their graphic simplicity and complete lack of images. The TV commercials are far more complex. The bright orange that fills the background of the print executions is absent from the TV versions. However, the signature logo is used in both media. Both executions adopt a similarly ironic stance toward the act of advertising itself. </p>

<p>At first glance, the communication strategy seems simple and straightforward. Directed to a general audience, this advertising simply announces that KDD (001 for international calls, 0077 for domestic calls), the au cell phone network, and DION Internet provider are merging to form KDDI. A closer look, however, reveals some subtleties.</p>

<p>In both print and TV, KDDI is positioned against NTT, in what students of advertising will instantly recognize as a reprise of the famous Avis &#8220;We try harder&#8221; campaign against Hertz Rent-a-Car. The overarching theme is how much more interesting life would be if NTT, the provider that dominates the telecommunications market in Japan, had a serious rival. The complete lack of mention of Japan Telecom/Vodafone, the third major player in this market, is also notable. Strategically, this absence suggests another famous example, the cola wars between Coca Cola and Pepsi, in which third-ranked Royal Crown was ignored and largely squeezed out of the market, its presence overwhelmed by the interest generated in the battle between its larger competitors. In sum, KDDI is positioned as the newcomer against NTT, as a challenger who makes the market more interesting and more fun, and implicitly against Japan Telecom/Vodafone, a competitor ignored in these ads as if to imply that it is not even in the game.</p>

<p>The first in the <em>TCC Nenkan</em> collection of the KDDI launch campaign print ads is a newspaper ad that consists of only three main graphic elements: the bright orange background and campaign logo mentioned above and a narrow white band at the foot of the page containing the information in orange type that on October 1 KDDI would begin operations. The phrase &#8221;<em>Shussha wa ashita kara</em>&#8221; (Tomorrow, we go to work) suggests that this was a teaser ad placed on September 30.</p>

<p>The campaign logo appears to be printed on a strip of blue denim, an effect created by its frayed edges. It contains three pieces of text, the new corporate logo &#8220;KDDI,&#8221; the English phrase &#8220;Designing the Future,&#8221; and, in roman letters, the message, &#8221;<em>sur&#333;gan mo daiji da keredo, jikk&#333; suru no ga ichiban daiji</em>&#8221; (Although slogans are important, what you actually do is the most important). This third element contains the first hint of irony. In this teaser ad, the campaign logo is positioned in the eye-catching upper left corner of the page. In subsequent print executions, it is moved to the lower right corner, making space for a big, bold headline centered in the orange background. The art directors among us might also notice that, in the different executions, the blue denim strip sits at different angles on the page, an effect that is deliberately casual.</p>

<p>The headline on the second print ad reads <em>Ganbare NTT, ganbaru KDDI</em> (NTT fight on, KDDI is fighting on). By changing one syllable, the copywriter has highlighted the difference between the energetic newcomer and the old-timer that needs some cheering on.</p>

<p>Headlines for a series of small posters read as follows:</p>

<ol>
<br />
	<li><em>Nihon de niban senshu, demo sekai de ichiban ni nareba ii jan</em> (Isn&#8217;t it OK to be No. 2 in Japan if you&#8217;re No. 1 worldwide?).</li>
<br />
	<li><em>Kenka shite mo katenai aite nara betsu na koto o yaru shika nai</em> (If you can&#8217;t win no matter how hard you try, you&#8217;d better do something else).</li>
<br />
	<li><em>Denwadai no nesagette itsumo itachigokko da na (yasuku naru no wa ii kedo)</em> (Lowering telephone charges is a vicious circle [although cheaper is better]).</li>
<br />
	<li><em>Kokumin toshite wa NTT to KDDI ga ky&#333;s&#333; shite kureru to omoshiroku naru to om&#333; na</em> (From a Japanese point of view, competition between NTT and KDDI will make things more interesting).</li>
<br />
	<li><em>Tsumannai k&#333;koku o suru kigy&#333; wa hobo tsumannai</em> (Companies with boring ads are almost all . . . boring).</li>
</ol>
<p>The series concludes with a third newspaper ad in which the white information band has expanded to fill the whole ad and the orange type spells out in detail how the new company sees itself.</p>

<p>The TV commercials will be examined in a subsequent issue of the <em>SWET Newsletter</em>.

<h2 class="title">Wireless Computer Networking Takes Off</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>&#8220;Wireless" literally means &#8220;without wires.&#8221; The British used it in the past as a synonym for &#8220;radio.&#8221; Now the term is cropping up in the computing world: wireless mice and keyboards, wireless Internet, wireless networking. To make matters even more confusing, it comes in a proliferation of flavors (Wi-Fi, AirPort [AirMac in Japan], Bluetooth), together with the associated alphabet soup (802.11b and all the rest). What does it all mean?
</p></div>
<h4>What Wireless Used to Mean</h4><p>
<p>Until recently, wireless communication between equipment used infrared signals, the same technology used by most remote control devices to operate audiovisual equipment. For example, many personal digital assistants (PDAs) incorporate an infrared transceiver to enable the &#8220;beaming&#8221; of data to similarly equipped siblings and synchronization with computers with an infrared port. Some cellular telephones and public telephones also have this capability, allowing wireless connection to the Internet, and it is sometimes possible to print using a printer equipped with an infrared connection.</p>

<p>I say &#8220;sometimes&#8221; for a number of reasons. First, and most important, infrared is a line-of-sight technology. An object coming between the computer and the printer disrupts the print queue. You can therefore forget about printing on a printer in the next room if a wall is in the way. Second, three meters is the maximum practical operating range for most infrared devices. This distance is suitable for swapping electronic business cards between PDAs but useless for more demanding applications. Third, infrared is slow. Under excellent conditions, infrared can transmit about 120,000 bits/second (or about 10,000 characters/second). This figure sounds like a lot, until you realize that 120,000 bits is the size of a medium-sized Web graphic or a single-page Word file. Therefore, infrared is not really suitable for moving large amounts of data between devices. For keyboards and mice, this slow speed is no disadvantage (how many people do you know who type at 10,000 characters/second?), but the line-of-sight limitation has always constrained the practical implementation of infrared technology.</p>

<h4>Biting Off What We Can Chew-Today&#8217;s &#8220;Wireless&#8221;</h4>
<p>Today, when we refer to &#8220;wireless,&#8221; we mean high-frequency radio wave technology.</p>

<p>With the development of new chip technologies to empower very local digital data streams, the system known as Bluetooth (named after Harald Blatand, the Viking king reputed to have united Norway and Denmark) has the potential to replace infrared as a low-cost wireless medium. Embedded technology can be used to identify other Bluetooth-equipped devices and exchange data between them at more than ten times the speed of infrared transmission. The distance at which Bluetooth devices can be separated is only two to three times that of infrared, but the line-of-sight issue is no longer a problem. Furthermore, Bluetooth can synchronize and exchange data between devices, talk to printers, and receive signals from keyboards, mice, and other devices, automatically adding devices to and removing them from the system as needed.</p>

<p>In contrast, setting up a network of devices connected by cables is a complex business. The devices need to be intelligent enough to handle the overhead required as part of a network and therefore larger (in software terms, at any rate) and more complex. (Think of overhead as the difference between a freelancer and an in-house writer: a freelancer simply picks up the phone to talk to a contact, whereas an in-house writer needs to arrange a meeting room, time, and place, prepare an agenda, etc.) Each device on the network requires an address (or the use of a master address donor). And don&#8217;t forget all those cables and hubs and routers. A well-designed wireless network can relieve you of at least some of these problems.</p>

<h4>Basing Your Network on Wireless</h4>
<p>Wired networks are pretty fast. Compared with infrared, which operates at 120,000 bits/second, the slowest Ethernet network operates at 10,000,000 (10-Base), and 100-Base, ten times faster, is now the norm. By comparison, the slowest wireless networking standard (and currently the most common), 802.11b, transmits data at just over 11 Mbps. That&#8217;s faster than 10-Base Ethernet and marginally slower than the theoretical speed of the fastest asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) now available in Japan.</p>

<p>To implement wireless networking, you need a wireless transceiver in your computer (usually a card but sometimes a USB device) and a wireless hub or &#8220;base station.&#8221; The base station connects wirelessly to the &#8220;hosts&#8221; (computers, printers, etc.) and by cable to a conventional wired local area network (LAN) or the Internet. In other words, the high-frequency radio waves between the hosts and the base station take the place of Ethernet cables. Anything you normally do using Ethernet over a LAN, such as connecting to the Internet, sharing files, or printing, can be done over the wireless network.</p>

<p>What makes wireless networking particularly useful is that devices connect to and disconnect from the network as needed. For example, I started writing this article at home, continued writing it on the train, and am now at home again. In that time, I&#8217;ve successfully disconnected from and reconnected to my home network, all without touching a single cable and without rebooting or reconfiguring my computer.</p>

<p>For a computer to join and leave the network as needed, its operating system must support this functionality. Currently, Mac OS X v. 10.2 and Windows XP are the leaders. AirPort (known as AirMac in Japan for copyright reasons) is Apple&#8217;s implementation of the 802.11b wireless standard, which is also known as Wi-Fi, from &#8220;wireless fidelity.&#8221; Although it did not invent the standard, Apple was responsible for making it accessible to the world. Wi-Fi is not only used for home networks but also used at coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and other public areas in Tokyo and other major Japanese cities to provide free or fee-based public wireless Internet access.</p>

<p>What are the disadvantages of wireless networking? It runs down the batteries on your laptop computer. All those radio waves coming into and going out of your computer consume power. Wireless networking operates at a range of about fifty meters. My local park seems to be fifty-one meters from my base station, which means I can&#8217;t sit in the park and work on sunny days, as much as I&#8217;d like to. Health hazards from the radio waves? I don&#8217;t like to think about that while resting a wireless-connected laptop computer on my lap.</p>

<p>Security is another concern. A good base station will prevent other computers from using it except those you explicitly specify. (All wireless adapters have a number &#8220;burned into&#8221; the hardware that can&#8217;t be changed.) You can also use passwords to restrict access to the base station. These measures stop others from using your Internet connection for free and from accessing the data on your network in the event you have left passwords unset and doors for snoopers to walk through on your computers. Most good base stations also support encryption, which prevents eavesdroppers from outside the network from looking over your shoulder electronically. Although encryption will deter 99% of casual snoopers, it is not unbreakable, so if you&#8217;re involved in rocket science or work for a three-letter agency, I suggest that you do not use wireless networking. If you do &#8220;go wireless,&#8221; make sure you read about and implement the security features of your base station. I have successfully logged into several wireless networks around Tokyo that were not meant to be open but turned out to be freely available to the nearest taker. One of my neighbors regularly turns on his or her base station, allowing me to use that network. I&#8217;ve tried to warn the owner but have not yet discovered his or her identity.</p>

<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
<p>The 802.11b standard provides reasonable networking speed, but as anyone who works with large files and has made the leap from (wired) 10-Base to 100-Base Ethernet knows, you can never have enough bits per second traveling between computers. The 802.11a wireless standard provides up to five times the speed of 802.11b but at a cost: it&#8217;s incompatible with 802.11b networks, which are widely used. Enter 802.11g. (Extensions c, d, e, and f aren&#8217;t relevant to this discussion.) Recently introduced by Apple as AirPort Extreme (AirMac Extreme in Japan), 802.11g provides five times the speed of older networks and greater compatibility with them. The range is about the same as before with 802.11b.</p>

<p>The ideal situation for technophiles is the ability to log on to the Internet at broadband speed from anywhere. We have a little way to go before that happens, but in the meantime, you may want to check out the cellular and PHS modems (another form of wireless) allowing access from a wider variety of places, although at a slower speed. I use an NTT DoCoMo PHS modem that allows me to log on and check my email within a minute. Since this service is priced on a per-minute basis, it&#8217;s not suitable for extended surfing, but it&#8217;s fine for a quick mail check. Other cellular carriers provide similar hardware, and a variety of cables and related hardware is available to enable your laptop or other portable device to access the Internet through your mobile phone.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next? Now that hardware components have been standardized, more software embedded in the networking equipment itself to make wireless networks easier to set up and maintain is on the horizon. At present, although computer manufacturers have produced wireless networking equipment that doesn&#8217;t require expert help to use successfully, it&#8217;s not as easy to set up and use as, say, a CD player. Apple is currently leading with self-configuring networks, and Microsoft is pursuing a rival standard that also holds great promise. But even with today&#8217;s software, for anyone who has successfully set up a home LAN, a simple wireless network is easy enough to install and provides freedom from the tyranny of spaghetti-like cables.

<h2 class="title">Yes, We Can Learn from Experience</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>Write-up of January 11 meeting, Larry Brouhard presentation:</p>

<p>Lessons from a long career in technical documentation: Omit unnecessary words. Follow William K. Zinsser&#8217;s advice in <em>On Writing Well,</em> &#8220;There is no sentence too short in the eyes of God.&#8221;
</p></div>
<p>Like all great teachers, Larry Brouhard is also a great performer, with a gift for translating his expertise into a memorable show-and-tell exercise. For those who missed his presentation on January 11, it is summarized below.</p>

<p>Hearing this documentation guru and translation industry veteran reminisce about his experiences was a trip down memory lane, a chance to revisit those good old days when the documentation for a single mainframe computer could run to 80,000 pages and an enterprising translator could build a company by translating technical Japanese into reasonably readable English, even if the original text were Greek from the translator&#8217;s viewpoint. For those of us old enough to remember those days, it was also a chance to recall when CP/M&reg; and WordStar&reg; running on an 8-bit personal computer with eight-inch-wide floppy disks were the hottest things in town and a welcome reminder that, despite everything that has happened since, writing, editing, and translating remain learnable crafts.</p>

<p>Brouhard began by drawing a vital distinction between &#8220;writers&#8221; and those who write for a living. Writers are people who write things and then try to sell them. Sometimes a path to fame, writing is rarely a path to fortune. People who write for a living as journalists, ad copywriters, technical writers, or technical editors, on the other hand, may toil in obscurity but can, if they are good at what they do, make a decent living. Brouhard described himself as one who writes for a living and directed his remarks to those in the field.</p>

<h4>The Early Years</h4>
<p>In sharing his background, Brouhard highlighted the impact of tennis, music, and the United States Air Force. He would have loved to play at Wimbledon, but other careers appeared more feasible. He would have loved to play the trombone with Louis Prima&#059; that love took him into the Air Force and a brief career with the Air Force Jazz Band, but then the Air Force decided to train him as an electronics technician. That training did more than familiarize him with electronics technology&#059; it became, Brouhard said, the model for training and documentation that guided the creation of his company.</p>

<p>After leaving the Air Force, Brouhard took a brief detour into academia, attending Sophia University and considering a Ph.D. in sociology. But the call of business was too strong. Like many of us, he ran a business on the side to make money while studying. Unlike many of us, he built a thriving company. How was he able to achieve this? The slides he showed focused on seven points:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I can. What?&#8221; When asked if he could do a job, Larry always said yes and then asked what the client wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fix English documents.&#8221; This is precisely where many of us started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Build digital electronic trainers.&#8221; This is not something that most of us can do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write software and courseware.&#8221; These are learnable but still relatively rare skills, and were especially so in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Develop slide and video training materials.&#8221; This request would now more likely be for Web sites or interactive CDs/DVDs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do brain surgery.&#8221; This means staying one step ahead of the client and its needs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Learn to say, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry&#8217; a thousand ways.&#8221; A company president learns to apologize for the mistakes that others in the company make.</p>

<p>During the 1970s, Japan began to shift from selling products to selling systems abroad, creating huge demand for the documentation that systems require. Brouhard thus established ICCS to meet that demand. But while the systems were sophisticated, the documentation was not. For the translators who translated Japanese engineers&#8217; handwritten Japanese, pencil and paper were state-of-the-art equipment. Making the change to typewriters was an early management challenge. Even after the change to typewriters, producing documentation remained labor intensive. Typists typed on IBM Selectric typewriters. Graphic artists drew illustrations by hand. Typesetters created proportionally spaced text and sometimes placed letters upside down. Paste-up artists manually glued text and graphics together to create the camera-ready copy delivered to printing companies.</p>

<p>Then the computers we now reminisce about became available. Brands like Digital, Wang, and CPT entered the market and subsequently disappeared. The Macintosh pointed the way to the desktop publishing future. For a brief period, there was good money to be made programming filters to move text and graphics between different pieces of hardware and their software programs. Now, however, that far fewer people are required to do the jobs for which a large staff was once required, and documentation has become more sophisticated and Japanese manufacturers more cost-conscious, the days of huge and hugely lucrative documentation projects appear to have gone forever.</p>

<p>How have Brouhard and the ICCS Group survived? In the final part of his presentation, Brouhard offered a number of survival tips. First, learn the craft of editing and writing. For Brouhard, the basics are contained in Strunk and White&#8217;s <em>Elements of Style</em> and Fowler&#8217;s <em>The King&#8217;s English</em> (early editions of both, he noted, can now be accessed on the Web). Follow the advice of <em>Clear Technical Writing</em> by John Brogan: write in the active voice as much as possible. Think of writing as baking a cake: your recipe should include informative words, position/direction/condition words, glue words to hold everything together, and just a few sweetening adjectives and adverbs for flavor. Omit unnecessary words. Follow William K. Zinsser&#8217;s advice in <em>On Writing Well,</em> &#8220;There is no sentence too short in the eyes of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Second, when translating from Japanese to English, learn to reverse-engineer. Break the text into small pieces, analyze it, and put it back together with a topic sentence. Treat original writing as a process of analysis, design, writing, testing, production, and revision. Work from an outline, write topic sentences, and then fill in the details. Test what you have written by asking others to read it.</p>

<p>Third, revise and let it go. Do not waste time agonizing, especially past deadlines. Note, too, that once you have finished, you may be able to revise what you have written and sell it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Fourth, one vital point is not only to know what you have done but also to be able to explain it. No skill is more vital in dealing with clients.</p>

<p>Fifth, use technology and use it well. Learn to type fast and well, but do not use a word processor as if it were merely a typewriter. Learn the rudiments of basic graphics programs&#059; providing graphics as well as text increases the value of your product. Do not use Excel or PowerPoint as a word processing program.</p>

<p>Sixth, make a point of being easy to work with. Prima donnas and whiners both lose business.</p>

<p>Finally, learn something new every day and remember to keep what you do in perspective. People who write for a living have to live with the fact that most of their work is ephemeral. The pages labored over so hard may finally be used to wrap fish.</p>

<p>The words on Larry&#8217;s final slide were &#8220;Thank You&#8221; and &#8220;Happy Writing.&#8221; SWET can only express its gratitude by saying the same to him.
