1. What is sci.lang for?<br>
<br>
Discussion of the scientific or historical study of human language(s).<br>
Note the &quot;sci.&quot; prefix.&nbsp; The main concern here is with _facts_ and<br>
theories accounting for them.<br>
<br>
For advice on English usage, see alt.usage.english or misc.writing.<br>
For casual chatter about other languages see soc.culture.&lt;whatever&gt;.<br>
Discussion of or in Greek or Latin is available in sci.classics.<br>
The sci.lang.translation newsgroup focusses on translation and issues of <br>
&nbsp; concern to translators and interpreters.<br>
The comp.ai.nat-lang newsgroup focusses on natural language processing<br>
&nbsp; by computers.<br>
<br>
Like all &quot;sci.&quot; newsgroups, sci.lang is not meant to substitute for<br>
a dictionary or even a college library.&nbsp; If the answer to your question<br>
can be looked up easily, then do so rather than using the net.<br>
If you don't have a library, then ask away, but explain your situation.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
2. What is linguistics?<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The scientific study of human language, including:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Phonetics (physical nature of speech)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Phonology (use of sounds in language)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Morphology (word formation)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Syntax (sentence structure)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Semantics (meaning of words & how they combine into sentences)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pragmatics (effect of situation on language use)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Or, carving it up another way:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Theoretical linguistics (pure and simple: how languages work)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Historical linguistics (how languages got to be the way they are)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Sociolinguistics (language and the structure of society)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Psycholinguistics (how language is implemented in the brain)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Applied linguistics (teaching, translation, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Computational linguistics (computer processing of human language)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some linguists also study sign languages, non-verbal communication,<br>
&nbsp; animal communication, and other topics besides spoken language.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
3. Does linguistics tell people how to speak or write properly?<br>
<br>
No.&nbsp; Linguistics is descriptive, not prescriptive.<br>
Linguistics can often supply facts which help people arrive at a<br>
recommendation or value judgement, but the recommendation or value<br>
judgement is not part of linguistic science itself.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
4. What are some good books about linguistics?<br>
<br>
(These are cited by title and author only. Full ordering information<br>
can be obtained from BOOKS IN PRINT, available at most bookstores and<br>
at even the smallest public libraries.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; CAMBRIDGE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LANGUAGE, by David Crystal (1987) is a good place <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  to start if you are new to this field.<br>
&nbsp; LANGUAGE, by Edward Sapir (1921), is a readable survey of linguistics <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  that is still worthwhile despite its age.<br>
&nbsp; Some good surveys of linguistics:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  An Introduction to Language - Fromkin and Rodman (1974)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  The Social Art - Ronald Macaulay (1995)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  The Language Web - Jean Aitchison <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Language: The Basics - R.L. Trask (1996)<br>
&nbsp; AN INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE, by Fromkin and Rodman (1974), is one of the <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  best intro linguistics survey texts.&nbsp; There are many others.<br>
&nbsp; THE WORLD'S MAJOR LANGUAGES, edited by Bernard Comrie (1987) contains<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  meaty descriptions of fifty languages.<br>
&nbsp; AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD by Anatole Lyovin (1997)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  surveys everything and has good sketches of some languages Comrie skips. <br>
&nbsp; CAMBRIDGE TEXTBOOKS IN LINGUISTICS (a series) consists of good,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  modestly priced introductions to all the areas of linguistics.<br>
&nbsp; Any encyclopedia will give you basic information about widely studied<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  languages, alphabets, etc.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
5. How did language originate?<br>
<br>
Nobody knows.&nbsp; Very little evidence is available.<br>
See however D. Bickerton, LANGUAGE AND SPECIES (1990).<br>
<hr size=2><br>
6. What is known about prehistoric language?<br>
<br>
Quite a lot, if by &quot;prehistoric&quot; you'll settle for maybe 2000 years<br>
before the development of writing.&nbsp; (Language is many thousands of years<br>
older than that.)<br>
<br>
Languages of the past can be recovered by comparative reconstruction<br>
from their descendants.&nbsp; The comparative method relies mainly on<br>
pronunciation, which changes very slowly and in highly systematic<br>
ways.&nbsp; If you apply it to French, Spanish, and Italian, you <br>
reconstruct late colloquial Latin with a high degree of accuracy;<br>
this and similar tests show us that the method works.<br>
<br>
Also, if you use the comparative method on unrelated languages,<br>
you get nothing. So comparative reconstruction is a test of whether <br>
languages are related (to a discernible degree).<br>
<br>
The ancient languages Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and several others form <br>
a group known as &quot;Indo-European.&quot;&nbsp; Comparative reconstruction from <br>
them gives a language called Proto-Indo-European which was spoken <br>
around 2500 B.C.&nbsp; Many Indo-European words can be reconstructed with <br>
considerable confidence (e.g., *ekwos 'horse').&nbsp; The grammar was <br>
similar to Homeric Greek or Vedic Sanskrit.&nbsp; Similar reconstructions are<br>
available for some other language families, though none has been as <br>
thoroughly reconstructed as Indo-European.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
7. What do those asterisks mean?<br>
<br>
Attached to a word, either of 2 things.<br>
An unattested, reconstructed word (such as Indo-European *ekwos);<br>
or an ungrammatical sentence (such as *Himself saw me).<br>
<br>
(In a generative rule, such as AP -&gt; Adj (AP)*, it indicates that<br>
an element may be repeated zero or more times.)<br>
<hr size=2><br>
8. How are present-day languages related?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--Scott DeLancey]<br>
<br>
This is an INCOMPLETE list of some of the world's language families.&nbsp; More<br>
detailed classifications can be found in Voegelin and Voegelin, CLASSIFICATION<br>
AND INDEX OF THE WORLD'S LANGUAGES (1977), and M. Ruhlen, A GUIDE TO THE <br>
WORLD'S LANGUAGES (1987).&nbsp; (Note: Ruhlen's classification recognizes a <br>
number of higher-order groups which most linguists regard as speculative).<br>
<br>
A language family is a group of languages that have been proven to have<br>
descended from a common ancestral language.&nbsp; Branches of families likewise<br>
represent groups of languages with a more recent common ancestor.&nbsp; For <br>
example, English, Dutch, and German have a common ancestor which we label<br>
Proto-West-Germanic, and thus belong to the West Germanic branch of Germanic.<br>
Icelandic and Norwegian are descended from Proto-North Germanic, a separate <br>
branch of Germanic.&nbsp; All the Germanic languages have a common ancestor, <br>
Proto-Germanic; farther back, this ancestor was descended from Proto-Indo-<br>
European, as were the ancestors of the Italic, Slavic, and other branches.<br>
<br>
Not all languages are known to be related to each other.&nbsp; It is possible that <br>
they are related but the evidence of relationship has been lost; it's also <br>
possible they arose separately.&nbsp; It is likely that some of the families <br>
listed here will eventually turn out to be related to one another.<br>
<br>
While low-level close relationships are easy to demonstrate, higher-order <br>
classification proposals must rely on more problematic evidence and tend to <br>
be controversial.&nbsp; Recently linguists such as Joseph Greenberg and Vitalij <br>
Shevoroshkin have attracted attention both in linguistic circles and in the <br>
popular press with claims of larger genetic units, such as Nostratic <br>
(comprising Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic) or <br>
Amerind (to include all the languages of the New World except Na-Dene and<br>
Eskimo-Aleut).&nbsp; Most linguists regard these hypotheses as having a grossly <br>
insufficient empirical foundation, and argue that comparisons at that depth <br>
are not possible using available methods of historical linguistics.<br>
<br>
This list isn't intended to be exhaustive, even for families like Germanic<br>
and Italic.&nbsp; Nor is it the last word on what's a &quot;language&quot;; see question 12.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note: English is not descended from Latin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; English is a Germanic language with a lot of Latin vocabulary,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; borrowed from French in the Middle Ages.<br>
<br>
INDO-EUROPEAN<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; GERMANIC<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; North Germanic:&nbsp; Icelandic, Norwegian / Swedish / Danish<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; East Germanic:&nbsp; Gothic (extinct)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; West Germanic:&nbsp; English, Dutch, German, Yiddish<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ITALIC<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Osco-Umbrian:&nbsp; Oscan, Umbrian (extinct languages of Italy)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Latin and its modern descendants (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Catalan, Rumanian, French, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; CELTIC<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P-Celtic:&nbsp; Welsh, Breton, Cornish<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Q-Celtic:&nbsp; Irish, Scots Gaelic, Manx<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some extinct European languages were also Celtic, notably those of Gaul<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; HELLENIC:&nbsp; Greek (ancient and modern)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SLAVIC:&nbsp; Russian, Bulgarian, Polish, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, etc. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (not Rumanian or Albanian)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; BALTIC:&nbsp; Lithuanian and Latvian<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; INDO-IRANIAN<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indic:&nbsp; Sanskrit and its modern descendants (Hindi-Urdu, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Gypsy (Romany), Bengali, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Iranian: Persian (ancient and modern), Pashto (Afghanistan), others<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ALBANIAN:&nbsp; Albanian<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ARMENIAN:&nbsp; Armenian<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; TOKHARIAN (an extinct language of NW China)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; HITTITE (extinct language of Turkey)<br>
<br>
AFRO-ASIATIC<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SEMITIC:&nbsp; Arabic, Hebrew (not Yiddish; see above), Aramaic, Amharic<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and other languages of Ethiopia<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; CHADIC:&nbsp; languages of northern Africa, e.g. Hausa<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; CUSHITIC:&nbsp; Somali, other languages of eastern Africa<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; EGYPTIAN:&nbsp; Ancient Egyptian<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; BERBER:&nbsp; languages of North Africa<br>
<br>
NIGER-KORDOFANIAN:&nbsp; includes most of the languages of sub-Saharan <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Africa.&nbsp; Most of the languages are in the NIGER-CONGO branch; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; most widely known subgroup of N-C is BANTU (Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, etc.) <br>
<br>
URALIC <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finnish, Estonian, Saami (Lapp), Hungarian, and several <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; languages of central Russia<br>
<br>
MONGOL:&nbsp; Mongolian, Buryat, Kalmuck, etc.<br>
TURKIC:&nbsp; Turkish, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, and other languages of Central Asia<br>
TUNGUSIC: Manchu, Juchen, Evenki, Even, Oroch, and other languages of NE Asia<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some linguists group these three families together as ALTAIC.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather more controversially, some add Korean and Japanese to this group.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been claimed that URALIC and ALTAIC are related (as URAL-ALTAIC),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; but this idea is not widely accepted.<br>
<br>
DRAVIDIAN:&nbsp; languages of southern India, including Tamil, Telugu, etc.<br>
<br>
SINO-TIBETAN<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SINITIC:&nbsp; Chinese (several &quot;dialects&quot;, or arguably distinct languages:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mandarin, Wu (Shanghai), Min (Hokkien [Fujian], Taiwanese), <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yue (Cantonese), Hakka, Gan, Xiang<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; TIBETO-BURMAN: Tibetan, Burmese, various languages of Burma,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; China, India, and Nepal<br>
<br>
AUSTROASIATIC<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; MON-KHMER:&nbsp; Vietnamese, Khmer (Cambodian), and various minority <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tribal languages of Southeast Asia<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; MUNDA:&nbsp; tribal languages of eastern India<br>
<br>
AUSTRONESIAN<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Malay-Indonesian, other languages of Indonesia (Javanese, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Philippine languages: Tagalog, Ilocano, Bontoc, etc.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aboriginal languages of Taiwan (Tsou, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Polynesian languages: Hawaiian, Maori, Samoan, Tahitian, etc.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Micronesian:&nbsp; Chamorro (spoken in Guam), Yap, Truk, etc.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Malagasy (spoken in Madagascar)<br>
&nbsp; Most of these languages fall in a branch called MALAYO-POLYNESIAN<br>
<br>
JAPANESE:&nbsp; A number of linguists argue that Japanese is ALTAIC; others,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; that it is most closely related to AUSTRONESIAN, or that it represents <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a mixture of AUSTRONESIAN and ALTAIC elements.<br>
<br>
TAI-KADAI:&nbsp; Thai, Lao, and other languages of southern China and <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; northern Burma.&nbsp; Possibly related to AUSTRONESIAN.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An outdated hypothesis that TAI is part of SINO-TIBETAN is still <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; often found in reference works and introductory texts.<br>
<br>
AUSTRALIA:&nbsp; the Aboriginal languages of Australia are conservatively <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; classified into 26 families, the largest being PAMA-NYUNGAN, consisting<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; of about 200 languages originally spoken over 80-90% of Australia.<br>
<br>
A large number of language families are found in North and South America.<br>
There are numerous proposals which group these into larger units, some of<br>
which will probably be demonstrated in time.&nbsp; To date no New World language <br>
has been proven to be related to any Old World family.&nbsp; The larger North <br>
American families include:<br>
<br>
ESKIMO-ALEUT:&nbsp; two Eskimo languages and Aleut.<br>
ATHAPASKAN:&nbsp; most of the languages of Alaska and northwestern Canada,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; also includes Navajo and Apache.&nbsp; Eyak (in Alaska) is related to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Athapaskan; some linguists put these together with Tlingit and Haida<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; in a NA-DENE family.<br>
ALGONQUIAN:&nbsp; most of Canada and the Northeastern U.S., includes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cree, Ojibwa, Cheyenne, Blackfoot<br>
IROQUOIAN:&nbsp; the languages of NY state (Mohawk, Onondaga, etc.) and Cherokee<br>
SIOUAN:&nbsp; includes Dakota/Lakhota and other languages of the Plains<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; and Southeast U.S.<br>
MUSKOGEAN: Choctaw, Alabama, Creek, Mikasuki (Seminole) and other<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; languages of the southeast U.S.<br>
UTO-AZTECAN:&nbsp; a large family in Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; includes Nahuatl (Aztec), Hopi, Comanche, Paiute, etc.<br>
SALISH:&nbsp; languages of Washington and British Columbia<br>
HOKAN:&nbsp; languages of California and Mexico; a controversial grouping<br>
PENUTIAN:&nbsp; languages of California and Oregon; also controversial<br>
<br>
Work on documentation and classification of South American languages still <br>
has a long way to go.&nbsp; Generally recognized families include:<br>
<br>
ARAWAKAN, TUCANOAN, TUPI-GUARANI (including Guarani, a national language<br>
of Paraguay), CARIBAN, ANDEAN (including Quechua and Aymara)<br>
<br>
LANGUAGE ISOLATES:&nbsp; A number of languages around the world have never been<br>
successfully shown to be related to any others-- in at least some cases <br>
because any related languages have long been extinct.&nbsp; The most famous <br>
isolate is Basque, spoken in northern Spain and southern France; it is <br>
apparently a survival from before the Indo-Europeanization of Europe.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
9. Why do&nbsp; Hebrew and Yiddish<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Japanese and Chinese<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Persian and Arabic<br>
&nbsp;  look so much alike if they aren't related?<br>
<br>
Distinguish LANGUAGE from WRITING SYSTEM.<br>
In each of these cases one language has adopted part or all of the <br>
writing system of an unrelated language.<br>
<br>
(To a Chinese, English and Finnish look alike, because they're written <br>
in the same alphabet.&nbsp; Yet they are not historically related.)<br>
<br>
An excellent introduction to writing systems is Geoffrey Sampson's<br>
WRITING SYSTEMS (1985).&nbsp; The authoritative (but expensive) reference<br>
is Daniels and Bright's THE WORLD'S WRITING SYSTEMS (1996), which<br>
discusses every known script.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
10. How do linguists decide that languages are related?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
<br>
When linguists say that languages are related, they're not just remarking <br>
on their surface similarity; they're making a technical statement or claim<br>
about their history-- namely, that they can be regularly derived from a <br>
common parent language.<br>
<br>
Proto-languages are reconstructed using the comparative method.&nbsp; The <br>
first stage is to inspect and compare large amounts of vocabulary from the <br>
languages in question.&nbsp; Where possible we compare entire _paradigms_ (sets <br>
of related forms, such as the those of the present active indicative in <br>
Latin), rather than individual words.<br>
<br>
The inspection should yield a set of regular sound correspondences between <br>
the languages.&nbsp; By regular, we mean that the same correspondences are <br>
consistently observed in identical phonetic environments.&nbsp; Finally, _sound <br>
changes_ are formulated: language-specific rules which specify how the <br>
original common form changed in order to produce those observed in each <br>
descendent language.<br>
<br>
Applying the comparative method to the Romance languages, we might find<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 'I sense'&nbsp; Sard /sento/&nbsp; French /sa~/&nbsp;  Italian /sento/&nbsp;  Spanish /sjEnto/<br>
&nbsp; 'sleep'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /sonnu/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /som/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /sonno/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /suEn^o/<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 'hundred'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /kentu/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /sa~/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /tSento/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /sjEnto/<br>
&nbsp; 'five'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /kimbe/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /sE~k/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /tSinkwe/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /sinko/<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 'I run'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /kurro/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /kur/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /korro/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /korro/<br>

and hundreds of similar examples.&nbsp; We see some correspondences--<br>
<br>
&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sard /s/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; French /s/&nbsp; &nbsp;  Italian /s/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Spanish /s/<br>
&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /k/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /s/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /tS/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /s/<br>
&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /k/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /k/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /k/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  /k/<br>
<br>
but they seem to conflict: does Sard /k/ correspond to Spanish /s/ or /k/?<br>
Does French /s/ correspond to Italian /s/ or /tS/?<br>
<br>
In fact we will find that the correspondences are regular, once we observe<br>
that (2) is seen before a front vowel (i or e), while (3) is seen in other<br>
environments.&nbsp; Alternations within paradigms, such as It. /diko/ 'I say' <br>
vs. /ditSe/ 'says', will help us make and confirm such generalizations.<br>
<br>
We may interpret these now-regular correspondences as indicating that an <br>
initial /s/ in the proto-language has been retained in all four languages, <br>
and likewise initial /k/ in Sard; but that /k/ changed to /s/ or /tS/ in <br>
the other languages in the environment of a front vowel.<br>
<br>
Actually, this process is iterative.&nbsp; For instance, at first glance we <br>
might think that German _haben_ and Latin _habere_ 'have' are obvious <br>
cognates.&nbsp; However, after noting the regular correspondence of German h to <br>
Latin c, we are forced to change our minds, and look to _capere_ 'seize' <br>
as a better cognate for _haben_.<br>
<br>
Thus, similarity of words is only a clue, and perhaps a misleading one.<br>
Linguists conclude languages are related, and thus derive from a common<br>
ancestor, only if they find *regular* sound correspondences between them.<br>
<br>
To complicate things, derivations may be obscured by irregular changes,<br>
such as dissimilation, borrowing, or analogical change.&nbsp; For instance, <br>
the normal development of Middle English _kyn_ is 'kine', but this word<br>
has been largely replaced by 'cows', formed from 'cow' (ME _cou_) on the <br>
analogy of word-pairs like stone : stones.&nbsp; Analogy often serves to reduce <br>
irregularities in a language (here, an unusual plural).<br>
<br>
_Borrowing_ refers to taking words from other languages, as English has<br>
taken 'search' and 'garage' from French, 'paternal' from Latin, 'anger' from <br>
Old Norse, and 'tomato' from Nahuatl.&nbsp; How do we know that English doesn't<br>
derive from French or Nahuatl?&nbsp; The latter case is easy to eliminate: <br>
regular sound correspondences can't be set up between English and Nahuatl.<br>
<br>
But English has borrowed so heavily from French that regular correspondences <br>
do occur.&nbsp; Here, however, we find that the French borrowings are thickest in <br>
government, legal, and military domains; while the basic vocabulary (which <br>
languages borrow less frequently) is more akin to German.&nbsp; Paradigmatic <br>
correspondences like sing/sang/sung vs. singen/sang/gesungen also help show<br>
that the Germanic words are inherited, the French ones borrowed.<br>

11. What is Noam Chomsky's transformational grammar all about?<br>
<br>
Several things; it really comprises several layers of theory:<br>
<br>
(1) The hypothesis that much of the structure of human language is<br>
inborn (&quot;built-in&quot;) in the human brain, so that a baby learning to<br>
talk only has to learn the vocabulary and the structural &quot;parameters&quot;<br>
of his native language -- he doesn't have to learn how language works<br>
from scratch.<br>
<br>
The main evidence consists of:<br>
&nbsp;  - The fact that babies learn to talk remarkably well from what seems<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  to be inadequate exposure to language; it is claimed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  that babies acquire some rules of grammar that they could never<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  have &quot;learned&quot; from what is available to them, if the structure of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  language were not partly built-in.<br>
&nbsp;  - The fact that the structure of language on different levels<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  (vocabulary, ability to connect words, etc.) can be lost by injury<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  to specific areas of the brain.<br>
&nbsp;  - The fact that there are unexpected structural similarities between<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  all known languages.<br>
For detailed exposition see Cook, CHOMSKY'S UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR (1988), <br>
Newmeyer, GRAMMATICAL THEORY: ITS LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES (1983), and<br>
Pinker, THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT (1994).<br>
<br>
This theory is by no means accepted by all linguists, though many&nbsp;  <br>
would agree that some core part of language is innate.<br>
<br>
(2) The hypothesis that to adequately describe the grammar of a human<br>
language, you have to give each sentence at least two different structures, <br>
called &quot;deep structure&quot; and &quot;surface structure&quot;, together with rules<br>
called &quot;transformations&quot; that relate them. <br>
<br>
This is hotly debated.&nbsp; Some theories of grammar use two levels and<br>
some don't.&nbsp; Chomsky's original monograph, SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES (1957),<br>
is still well worth reading; this is what it deals with.<br>
<br>
(3) Chomsky's name is associated with specific flavors of transformational<br>
grammar.&nbsp; The model elaborated over the last few years is called GB<br>
(government and binding) theory; however, Chomsky's 1995 book on Minimalism<br>
contains significant departures from earlier work in GB.<br>
<br>
(4) Some people think Chomsky is the source of the idea that grammar ought<br>
to be viewed with mathematical precision.&nbsp; (Thus there are occasional<br>
vehement anti-Chomsky polemics such as THE NEW GRAMMARIAN'S FUNERAL, which<br>
are really polemics against grammar per se.)<br>
<br>
Although Chomsky contributed some valuable techniques, grammarians have<br>
_always_ believed that grammar was a precise, mechanical thing.&nbsp; They<br>
are highly divided, however, on the nature and function of those mechanisms!<br>
<hr size=2><br>
12. What is a dialect?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--M.C. + M.R.]<br>
A dialect is any variety of a language spoken by a specific community of<br>
people. Most languages have many dialects.<br>
<br>
Everyone speaks a dialect.&nbsp; In fact everyone speaks an _idiolect_, i.e.,<br>
a personal language.&nbsp; (Your English language is not quite the same as<br>
my English language, though they are probably very, very close.)<br>
<br>
A group of people with very similar idiolects are considered to be<br>
speaking the same dialect.&nbsp; Some dialects, such as Standard American<br>
English, are taught in schools and used widely around the world.<br>
Others are very localized.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Localized or uneducated dialects are _not_ merely failed attempts to speak<br>
the standard language.&nbsp; William Labov and others have demonstrated, for<br>
example, that the speech of inner-city blacks has its own intricate<br>
grammar, quite different in some ways from that of Standard English.<br>
<br>
It should be emphasized that linguists do not consider some dialects <br>
superior to others-- though speakers of the language may do so;<br>
and linguists do study people's attitudes toward language, since <br>
these have a strong effect on the development of language.<br>
<br>
Linguists call varieties of language &quot;dialects&quot; if the speakers can<br>
understand each other and &quot;languages&quot; if they can't.&nbsp; For example,<br>
Irish English and Southern American English are dialects of English,<br>
but English and German are different languages (though related).<br>
<br>
This criterion is not always as easy to apply as it sounds.<br>
Intelligibility may vary with familiarity and interest, or may depend<br>
on the subject.&nbsp; A more serious problem is the _dialect continuum_: a<br>
chain of dialects such that any two adjoining dialects are mutually<br>
intelligible, but the dialects at the ends are not.&nbsp; Speakers of<br>
Belgian Dutch, for instance, can't understand Swiss German, but<br>
between them there lies a continuum of mutually intelligible dialects.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the use of the terms &quot;language&quot; or &quot;dialect&quot; is politically<br>
motivated.&nbsp; Norwegian and Danish (being mutually intelligible) are<br>
dialects of the same language, but are considered separate languages<br>
because of their political independence.&nbsp; By contrast, Mandarin and<br>
Cantonese, which are mutually unintelligible, are often referred to<br>
as &quot;dialects&quot; of Chinese, due to the political and cultural unity of<br>
China, and because they share a common _written_ language.<br>
<br>
At this point we usually quote Max Weinreich: &quot;A language is a dialect <br>
with an army and a navy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because of such problems, some linguists reject the mutual<br>
intelligibility criterion; but they do not propose to return to<br>
arguments on political and cultural grounds.&nbsp; Instead, they prefer<br>
not to speak of dialects and languages at all, but only of different<br>
varieties, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
13. Are all languages equally complex, or are some more primitive than others?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--M.C. + M.R.]<br>
Before the 1900s many people believed that so-called &quot;primitive <br>
peoples&quot; would have primitive languages, and that Latin and Greek--<br>
or their own languages-- were inherently superior to other tongues.<br>
<br>
In fact, however, there is no correlation between type or complexity of<br>
culture and any measure of language complexity.&nbsp; Peoples of very simple<br>
material culture, such as the Australian Aborigines, are often found to <br>
speak very complex languages.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the size of the vocabulary and the variety and sophistication of<br>
literary forms will depend on the culture.&nbsp; The _grammar_ of all languages,<br>
however, tends to be about equally complex-- although the complexity may <br>
be found in different places.&nbsp; Latin, for instance, has a much richer<br>
system of inflections than English, but a less complicated syntax.<br>
<br>
As David Crystal puts it, &quot;All languages meet the social and psychological<br>
needs of their speakers, are equally deserving of scientific study, and can<br>
provide us with valuable information about human nature and society.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are only two case of really simple languages:<br>
<br>
* _Pidgins_, which result when speakers of different languages come to live <br>
and work together.&nbsp; Vocabulary is drawn from one or both languages, and a <br>
very forgiving grammar devised.&nbsp; Grammars of pidgins from around the world <br>
have interesting similarities (e.g. they are likely to use repetition to <br>
express plurals).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
A pidgin becomes a _creole_ when children acquire it as a native language;<br>
as it evolves to meet the needs of a primary language, its vocabulary and<br>
grammar become much richer.&nbsp; If a pidgin is used over a long period (for<br>
example, Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea), it may similarly develop into a <br>
more complex language known as an _extended pidgin_.<br>
<br>
* _Language death_, what happens when a language falls out of use-- an<br>
alarmingly widespread phenomenon, which has been studied in detail by<br>
linguists.&nbsp; The process typically takes several generations, and involves<br>
an increasingly simplified grammar and impoverished lexicon.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
14. What about artificial languages, such as Esperanto?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose]<br>
<br>
Hundreds of constructed languages have been devised in the last few centuries.<br>
Early proposals, such as those of Lodwick (1647), Wilkins, or Leibniz, were <br>
attempts to devise an ideal language based on philosophical classification <br>
of concepts, and used wholly invented words.&nbsp; Most were too complex to learn,<br>
but one, Jean Francois Sudre's Solresol, achieved some popularity in the last<br>
century; its entire vocabulary was built from the names of the notes of <br>
the musical scale, and could be sung as well as spoken.<br>
<br>
Later the focus shifted to languages based on existing languages, with a <br>
polyglot (usually European) vocabulary and a simplified grammar, whose purpose<br>
was to facilitate international communication.&nbsp; Johann Schleyer's Volapu&quot;k <br>
(1880) was the first to achieve success; its name is based on English <br>
(&quot;world-speech&quot;), and reflects Schleyer's notions of phonetic simplicity.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It was soon eclipsed by Ludwig Zamenhof's Esperanto (1887), whose grammar <br>
was simpler and its vocabulary more recognizable.&nbsp; Esperanto has remained <br>
the most successful and best-known artificial language, with a million or <br>
more speakers and a voluminous literature; children of Esperantists have <br>
even learned it as a native language.<br>
<br>
Its relative success hasn't prevented the appearance of new proposals, such<br>
as Ido, Interlingua, Occidental, and Novial.&nbsp; There have also been attempts<br>
to simplify Latin (Latino Sine Flexione, 1903) and English (Basic English, <br>
1930) for international use.&nbsp; The recent Loglan and Lojban, based on <br>
predicate logic, may represent a revival of a priori language construction.<br>

16. What about those Eskimo words for snow? (and other myths about language)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
<br>
For more myths and what's really going on, see LANGUAGE MYTHS (1999), <br>
edited by Laurie Bauer and Peter Trudgill (no linguistics knowledge needed).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;The Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow.&quot;<br>
<br>
This story is constantly being repeated, with various numbers given,<br>
despite the fact that it has no basis at all.&nbsp; No one who repeats this<br>
pseudo-factoid can list the hundreds of words for you, or even cite a <br>
work that does.&nbsp; They just heard it somewhere.<br>
<br>
The anthropologist Laura Martin has traced the development of this myth<br>
(including the steady growth in the number of words claimed).&nbsp; Geoffrey<br>
Pullum summarizes her report in THE GREAT ESKIMO VOCABULARY HOAX (1991).<br>
<br>
How many words are there really?&nbsp; Well, the Yup'ik language in particular<br>
has about two dozen roots describing snow or things related to snow.&nbsp; This<br>
is not particularly significant; English can amass about the same total:<br>
snow, sleet, slush, blizzard, flurry, avalanche, powder, hardpack,<br>
snowball, snowman, and other derivatives.<br>
<br>
The Yup'ik total could be greatly expanded by other derived words, since<br>
the Inuit languages can form hundreds of words from a single root.&nbsp; But<br>
this is true of all words in the language (and indeed of all agglutinative<br>
languages), not just the words for snow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;There's a town in Appalachia that speaks pure Elizabethan English.&quot;<br>
<br>
There isn't.&nbsp; All languages, everywhere, are constantly changing.&nbsp; Some<br>
areas speak more conservative dialects, but we know of no case where <br>
people speak exactly as their ancestors spoke centuries ago.<br>
<br>
Of course, ancient languages are sometimes revived; biblical Hebrew has<br>
been revived (with some modifications) in modern Israel; and there's a<br>
village in India in which Sanskrit is being taught as an everyday<br>
language.&nbsp; But these are conscious revivals of languages which have<br>
otherwise died out in everyday use, not survivals of living languages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;Chinese characters directly represent ideas, not spoken words.&quot;<br>
<br>
Westerners have been taken by this notion for centuries, ever since<br>
missionaries started describing the Chinese writing system.&nbsp; However, it's<br>
quite false.&nbsp; Chinese characters represent specific Chinese words.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
(To be precise, almost all characters represent a particular syllable with<br>
a particular meaning; about 10% however represent one syllable of a <br>
particular two-syllable word.)<br>
<br>
The vast majority of characters consist of a _phonetic_ giving the<br>
approximate pronunciation of the word, plus a _signific_ giving a clue to<br>
its meaning (thus distinguishing different syllables having different<br>
meanings).&nbsp; As an added difficulty, many of the phonetics are no longer<br>
helpful, because of sound changes since the characters were devised, over<br>
2000 years ago.&nbsp; However, it is estimated that 60% of the phonetics still<br>
give useful information about the character's pronunciation.<br>
<br>
To be sure, Japanese (among other languages) uses Chinese characters too,<br>
and it is a very different language from Chinese.&nbsp; However, we must look<br>
at exactly how the Japanese use the Chinese characters.&nbsp; Generally they<br>
borrowed both the characters and the words represented; it's rather as if<br>
when we borrowed words like _psychology_ from Greek, we wrote them in the<br>
Greek alphabet.&nbsp; Native Japanese words are also written using the Chinese<br>
characters for the closest Chinese words: if the Japanese word overlaps<br>
several Chinese words, different characters must be written in different<br>
contexts, according to the meanings in Chinese.<br>
<br>
A good demythologizing of common notions about Chinese writing is found in<br>
THE CHINESE LANGUAGE: FACT AND FANTASY, by John DeFrancis (1984).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;German lost out to English as the US's official language by 1 vote.&quot;<br>
<br>
This entertaining story is also told of Greek, Latin, and even Hebrew.<br>
<br>
There was never any such vote.&nbsp; Dennis Baron, in THE ENGLISH ONLY QUESTION<br>
(1990), thinks the legend may have originated with a 1795 vote concerning<br>
a proposal to publish federal laws in German as well as English.&nbsp; At one<br>
point a motion to table discussion (rather than referring the matter back<br>
to committee) was defeated 41-40.&nbsp; The proposal was eventually defeated. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;Sign language isn't really a language.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;  &quot;ASL is a gestural version of English.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sign languages are true languages, with vocabularies of thousands of words,<br>
and grammars as complex and sophisticated as those of any other language,<br>
though with fascinating differences from speech.&nbsp; If you think they are<br>
merely pantomime, try watching a mathematics lecture, a poetry reading, or<br>
a religious service conducted in Sign, and see how much you understand.<br>
<br>
ASL (American Sign Language) is not an invented system like Esperanto; it<br>
developed gradually and naturally among the Deaf.&nbsp; It has no particular<br>
relation to English; the best demonstration of this is that it is quite<br>
different from British Sign.&nbsp; Curiously enough, it is most closely related<br>
to French Sign Language, due to the influence of Laurent Clerc, who came<br>
from Paris in 1817 to be the first teacher of the Deaf in the US.<br>
<br>
ASL is not to be confused with Signed English, which is a word-for-word<br>
signed equivalent of English.&nbsp; Deaf people tend to find it tiring, because<br>
its grammar, like that of spoken languages, is linear, while that of ASL is<br>
primarily spatial.<br>
<br>
For more on Sign and the Deaf community, see Oliver Sacks' SEEING VOICES<br>
(1989), or Harlan Lane, WHEN THE MIND HEARS (1984) and THE MASK OF <br>
BENEVOLENCE.<br>

20. Is English a creole?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose]<br>
The change from Anglo-Saxon to Modern English (loss of gender and of<br>
case inflection, phonological change, acquisition of a huge stock of French<br>
and Latin vocabulary) is certainly dramatic, and has led some sci.lang <br>
posters, and even some linguists (e.g. Domingue, Bailey & Maroldt, <br>
Milroy) to the provocative suggestion that English suffered pidginization<br>
or creolization at the time of the Norman Conquest (1066) or the Norse<br>
invasions (from 865), or both.<br>
<br>
This hypothesis, as Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman have<br>
shown in LANGUAGE CONTACT, CREOLIZATION, AND GENETIC LINGUISTICS (1988), <br>
rests on an incomplete understanding of creolization and a shaky grasp on <br>
the history of English.&nbsp; There is a wide range of language contact <br>
situations, from casual contact to deep structural interference; English is <br>
by no means the most striking of these cases.&nbsp; It looks like a creole only <br>
if one ignores this range of phenomena and labels any case of moderate <br>
interference as creolization.<br>
<br>
For many of the changes in question, the chronology does not work out.<br>
For instance, the reduction of unstressed vowels to /@/, largely responsible<br>
for the loss of Old English nominal declensions, had taken place *before*<br>
the Conquest, and affected all of England, including areas never settled<br>
by the Norse.&nbsp; And English did absorb an immense amount of French and<br>
Latin vocabulary, but most of this occurred well *after* the Conquest--<br>
past 1450, two centuries after the nobility ceased to be French-speaking.<br>
<br>
Other points to note: 1) most of the simplifications and foreign borrowings<br>
seen in English occurred as well in other Germanic languages, notably<br>
Dutch, Low German, and the Scandinavian languages; 2) a particularly<br>
striking borrowing from Norse, the pronoun 'they', was probably adopted<br>
to avoid what otherwise would have been a merge of 'he/him' with 'they/them';<br>
3) the total number of French-speaking invaders was not more than<br>
50,000, compared to an English-speaking population of over 1.5 million--<br>
nowhere near the proportions that would threaten the normal inheritance<br>
of English.<br>

21. How do you look up a word in a Chinese or Japanese dictionary?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose]<br>
<br>
The vast majority of Chinese characters can be divided into two parts, the<br>
radical and the phonetic.&nbsp; Each part is another, simpler character.&nbsp; The<br>
_radical_ gives an idea of the meaning-- rather a vague idea, since<br>
traditionally there were only 214 different radicals.&nbsp; The _phonetic_<br>
identifies the sound, with a bit more precision: generally, all the<br>
characters that share a phonetic rhymed 2000 years ago in Archaic Chinese.<br>
<br>
(It's impossible to give examples in ASCII; see the Web page for more:<br>
<a href="http://www.zompist.com/lang21.html">http://www.zompist.com/lang21.html</a>)<br>
<br>
Characters are arranged in most Chinese dictionaries by radical.&nbsp; To find<br>
an unknown character, then, you identify the radical, and look up its<br>
section in the dictionary.&nbsp; The radicals are arranged in order of increasing<br>
complexity.&nbsp; Each radical's section is ordered by the number of strokes in<br>
the character.&nbsp; Several characters may have the same number of strokes;<br>
these must simply be scanned till the right one is found.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it isn't easy to identify the radical-- it's in an odd position<br>
(e.g. on the bottom or the right rather than the top or left side); or it's<br>
drawn in an abbreviated form; or it's not clear which of several similar<br>
radicals the character is listed under.&nbsp; It's also important to know the<br>
proper method for counting strokes.<br>
<br>
If a character isn't composed of a radical + phonetic, it's usually treated<br>
as one, graphically, for the purposes of dictionary lookup.&nbsp; For instance,<br>
the character for hao3 'good' is composed of the characters for 'woman' and<br>
'child'-- a _semantic_ compound.&nbsp; It's simply listed under the 'woman'<br>
radical, although zi3 'child' is not its phonetic.<br>
<br>
The People's Republic simplified a number of characters and radicals, and<br>
this changed the number of radicals-- there's 224 in my dictionary, for<br>
instance.&nbsp; The Japanese have made their own separate simplification.<br>

22. What about Nostratic and Proto-World?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose]<br>
In recent years some some linguists have attempted to reconstruct languages<br>
far older than Indo-European.<br>
<br>
*Nostratic*, said to underlie the Indo-European, Kartvelian (South Caucasion), <br>
Afro-Asiatic, Dravidian, Uralic, Altaic, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo-Aleut <br>
families, was first proposed by Holger Pedersen in 1903.&nbsp; More recently<br>
the greater part of work on Nostratic is due to Soviet linguists led by <br>
Vladislav Illich-Svitych, Aaron Dolgopolsky, and Vitaly Shevoroshkin.<br>
<br>
The methodology is the traditional comparative method, and over 600 roots<br>
have been proposed.&nbsp; Most linguists remain skeptical, believing that chance<br>
processes will have obscured any relationship at this level beyond<br>
reconstruction, or question the accuracy of the derivations (a charge which<br>
makes Nostraticists bristle).&nbsp;  Others simply suspend judgment, especially<br>
since much of the supporting material for Nostratic is available only in<br>
Russian.<br>
<br>
A good overview on Nostratic is Kaiser and Shevoroshkin, &quot;Nostratic&quot;, in<br>
the _Annual Review of Anthropology_, 17:309.&nbsp; Illich-Svitych's original<br>
Russian article (from _Etymologia_, 1965) has been translated in<br>
Shevoroshkin, ed., RECONSTRUCTING LANGUAGES AND CULTURES (1989).<br>
<br>
Joseph Greenberg has proposed a grouping which covers much the same language<br>
areas (omitting Afro-Asiastic and Dravidian, but adding Ainu and Gilyak),<br>
called *Eurasiatic*.&nbsp; Greenberg's method of _mass comparison_ (which he has<br>
also used to group together almost all Native American languages into one<br>
superfamily, Amerind) basically consists of assembling huge lists of<br>
common words and doing eyeball comparisons.<br>
<br>
This methodology has been severely criticized by many historical linguists.<br>
If 'mass comparison' were applied to the Indo-European languages, it would<br>
be bedevilled by false positives (caused by borrowing or chance) and by<br>
specious phonetic or semantic similarites.&nbsp; Greenberg's methods seem to<br>
linguists to abandon the very methodological severity which has put<br>
Indo-European linguistics on a scientific footing, and distinguished it from<br>
the work of cranks.&nbsp; Relax the rules enough, and you can derive any language<br>
from any other.<br>
<br>
Greenberg replies that the patterns he has found are compelling enough to<br>
justify his methods, and that he is merely following in the footsteps of <br>
the originators of the comparative method: linguists had to decide that the <br>
Indo-European languages were related before attempting reconstructions.<br>
<br>
The ultimate areal comparison would be *Proto-World*, the hypothetical<br>
ancestor of all human languages.&nbsp; Greenberg has mentioned Proto-World, but<br>
since he is not much interested in reconstruction, his proposal is not much<br>
more than a statement of the monogenetic theory (a single origin for all<br>
languages).&nbsp; Most linguists are skeptical that anything could be<br>
reconstructed at this hypothetical time depth.<br>
<br>
Greenberg's work on Amerind can be found in LANGUAGE IN THE AMERICAS (1987);<br>
on Eurasiatic, in the forthcoming INDO-EUROPEAN AND ITS CLOSEST RELATIVES:<br>
THE EURASIATIC LANGUAGE FAMILY.&nbsp; Introductions to the Nostratic and<br>
Proto-World controversies were published in both _The Atlantic_ and<br>
_Scientific American_ in April 1991.&nbsp; The essays in Lamb and Mitchell, eds.,<br>
SPRUNG FROM SOME COMMON SOURCE (1991), are also relevant.<br>
<br>
Loren Petrich maintains an annotated bibliography on Indo-European,<br>
Nostratic, and Proto-World.&nbsp; I am also indebted to Peter Michalove for<br>

23.&nbsp; What are phonemes and why's it so hard to lose a foreign accent? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose] <br>
The sounds (*phones*) humans can make are infinite; there's (almost always) <br>
a continuum of phones in between any two phones. <br>
<br>
In any one language, however, phones are grouped into 20 to 60 or so discrete <br>
groups of sounds called *phonemes*. The range of variation for each phoneme <br>
is discounted by speakers and hearers of the language, who perceive the <br>
entire range as &quot;the same sound.&quot; <br>
<br>
The English phoneme /p/ has two phonetic realizations or *allophones*: <br>
aspirated [ph] beginning a word and non-aspirated [p] elsewhere. But<br>
since the two types of /p/ never distinguish one word from another, speakers <br>
of English generally don't even notice the difference. (Linguists<br>
write phonemic transcriptions between /slashes/, and phonetic transcriptions <br>
in [brackets].) <br>
<br>
If we can find two words with different meaning but only one difference in <br>
sound between them-- a *minimal pair*-- then we've found distinct phonemes; <br>
e.g. /p/ and /b/ in English 'pit' and 'bit'. If two sounds never occur in <br>
the same phonetic environment (e.g. English [p] and [ph])-- if they're in <br>
*complementary distribution*-- then they're probably allophones of a single <br>
phoneme.&nbsp; (I say 'probably' because English [h] and [ng] are also in <br>
complementary distribution, but linguists balk at assigning them to one<br>
phoneme.)<br>
<br>
Other languages do not divide up the phonetic space in the same way.&nbsp; For <br>
instance, /p/ and /ph/ are separate phonemes in Mandarin Chinese (as in <br>
/pa1/ 'eight' and /pha1/ 'flower').&nbsp; And the vowels of 'late' and 'let', <br>
phonemes in English, are allophones of a single phoneme /e/ in Spanish. <br>
<br>
We're trained from childhood to make the phonetic distinctions our language <br>
uses to keep its phonemes apart, and to ignore those it doesn't.<br>
Learning to make different distinctions in a foreign language is quite <br>
difficult-- usually harder than making new sounds our native language lacks <br>
entirely.&nbsp; We'll continue to have an accent in the new language so long as <br>
we hear its sounds through our native language's phonemic filter. <br>

24. How likely are chance resemblances between languages?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
It depends-- to an astonishing degree-- on the amount of phonetic and<br>
semantic leeway you allow for a match.&nbsp; But in general the answer is <br>
&quot;Quite likely.&quot;<br>
<br>
For the sort of comparisons that are often posted to sci.lang, where<br>
perhaps just two consonants match, or nearly match, and the semantic <br>
matchups are quirky, one can expect literally hundreds of random matches.<br>

25. How are tone languages sung?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
It varies.&nbsp; Tones are basically ignored in Mandarin Chinese songs, <br>
for instance.&nbsp; (Does this make them hard to understand?&nbsp; Often, yes.)<br>
However, Cantonese songs are generally written in such a way as to <br>
preserve the relative pitch of successive syllables.&nbsp; E.g. a low tone <br>
following a high tone will be on a lower note.<br>

26. Why are there so many words for Germany?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
Basically, because there were Germans before there was a Germany. Each of <br>
the Germans' neighbors came up with their own name for them, long before <br>
there was a German state that people might want to refer to uniformly. <br>
<br>
_German_ is a relatively recent borrowing from Latin _Germanus_, whose origins<br>
are uncertain. It's been referred to Latin _germanus_ 'brotherly', Germanic <br>
_*geromann-_ 'spear-man', Old Irish _gair_ 'neighbour', etc. <br>
<br>
_Deutsch_ comes from Proto-Germanic _*theudisko-z_ 'of the people', from <br>
_*theuda_ 'people, nation'; originally it was used to distinguish the speech <br>
of the people from Latin, the language of scholarship. The English word <br>
'Dutch' is a derivative, and used to be used for any northern Germanic <br>
people, later narrowed down to those closest to England; the older usage is <br>
preserved in 'Pennsylvania Dutch'. <br>
<br>
The word *theuda survived into Middle English as _thede_, but was supplanted <br>
by Romance borrowings such as 'people' and 'nation'. Non-Germanic cognates <br>
include Oscan touto, Irish tu:ath, and Lithuanian tauta, all meaning 'people'. <br>
<br>
Italian _tedesco_ is another derivative of *theudisko-z. <br>
<br>
_Teutonic_ derives from a name of an ancient tribe in Jutland, the Teutones; <br>
if these were a German tribe their name is presumably another derivative of <br>
*theuda. <br>
<br>
French _allemand_ (and Spanish _alema'n_, etc., as well as older English <br>
_Almain_) derive from a particular tribe of Germans, the Alemanni ('all men'). <br>
<br>
Finnish _saksa_ derives from the name of another tribe, the Saxons. <br>
<br>
Russian _nemets_ is related to _nemoj_ 'dumb, mute'; to the ancient Slavs, not<br>
speaking in an understandable language was as good as not speaking at all.<br>
Hungarian _nemet_ is borrowed from Slavic. <br>
<br>
Latvian _Va:cija_ may derive from a word meaning 'west'. <br>

27. Why do both English and French have plurals in -s? <br>
-Miguel Carrasquer Vidal (adapted by markrose)] <br>
<br>
Despite what one might think, these are independent developments. <br>
<br>
The English s-plural comes from the PIE o-stem nominative plural ending *-o:s, <br>
*-o:s, apparently extended in Germanic to *-o:s-es by addition of the PIE plural<br>
suffix *-es (*-o:s itself comes from *-o-es). This *-o:ses became Proto-Germanic<br>
*-o:ziz or *-o:siz, depending on the accent, which gave the attested forms--<br>
Gothic -o:s, Old English -as, Old Saxon -os, and Old Norse -ar (with the change<br>
to words that were not a-stems, a tendency which has since become nearly<br>
universal.<br>
<br>
The n-plural of German is generalized from the PIE n-stems (*-on-es --&gt; -en).<br>
It was still present in Old English n-stems, and survives today in a few words<br>
like 'oxen'.<br>
<br>
The Romance s-plurals (-as, -os, -es) are derived from the accusative (PIE<br>
*-a:ns, *-ons, *-ens). Old French still had separate nominative and oblique<br>
(accusative/ablative) forms, but in the end, grammatical cases were dropped<br>
completely, and usually only the oblique forms were retained. <br>
<br>
In Italian and Romanian, final -s was phonetically lost, and the plurals are<br>
based on the nominative. The Latin nominative plural, at least in the o- and<br>
a:-stems, was based on PIE *-i, of pronominal origin, not *-es as in most other<br>
IE languages.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
28. How did genders and cases develop in IE?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--Mikael Thompson]<br>
Early stages of proto-Indo-European (PIE) didn't have feminine gender. This <br>
is attested in Hittite, the oldest recorded IE language; it had only <br>
masculine and neuter genders, divided basically between animate and <br>
inanimate objects. For most noun classes the PIE endings can be reconstructed <br>
as follows: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Animate Inanimate <br>
&nbsp;  Subject&nbsp; &nbsp;  *-s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *-0 <br>
&nbsp;  Object&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *-m&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *-0 <br>
For animate nouns, *-s indicated the source of action, *-m the thing acted <br>
upon; the zero ending indicates no syntactic role. The basic idea is that <br>
only living things can act upon other things, so only animate nouns could <br>
take the *-s. <br>
<br>
Such a system is characteristic of active/stative languages. Other<br>
features of PIE fit in with this observation; for instance, in PIE objects<br>
like fire and water which are inanimate but move seemingly of their own<br>
will have two separate names. In many languages with an active-stative<br>
distinction there are such pairs of words. As this distinction was lost in<br>
IE, different branches retained just one of the words: e.g. English water,<br>
Greek hydor, Hittite watar form one group (from PIE *wed-), while Latin<br>
aqua is from PIE *akwa:-.<br>
<br>
The animate nouns are the historical source for the masculine gender, and<br>
the inanimate nouns for the neuter. This is why in all the classic IE<br>
languages the neuter nominative and accusative have identical forms, and<br>
the only basic difference between masculine and neuter nouns is in the<br>
accusative.<br>
<br>
Earlier historical linguists cheerfully reconstructed eight cases for PIE,<br>
on the model of Sanskrit; but the IE languages with many cases are now<br>
considered to be innovative, not conservative. The other cases developed<br>
from postpositions or derivational suffixes.&nbsp; Luwian, a sister language of<br>
Hittite, for instance, has no genitive, but has an adjective-forming<br>
suffix -assi, as in harmah-assi-s 'of the head'. (This is an adjective,<br>
not a genitive, because it can be declined.) Genitives in other languages<br>
often seem to be developments of cognates to this suffix. <br>
<br>
PIE didn't bother much with specifying plurals, but when it did, it added<br>
an *-s or other endings. The neuter plural in all IE languages is not<br>
descended from this, however-- active/stative languages typically don't<br>
mark plurals for inanimate nouns-- but is instead a collective noun,<br>
treated grammatically as a singular. This collective noun ended in *-a in<br>
the nominative and accusative, and eventually it developed into the<br>
feminine, which in all the old IE languages has the same form in the<br>
nominative singular as does the neuter plural nominative- accusative. It<br>
is also why the Greek neuter plural took a singular verb. <br>
<br>
The reason it is called the feminine, of course, is that nouns indicating<br>
females fell in this gender most of the time. This is puzzling, and<br>
probably we must accept it as a fact whose explanation can't be recovered<br>
from the depths of time.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
29. What is the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose] <br>
According to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, language determines the<br>
categories and much of the content of thought. &quot;We dissect nature along<br>
lines laid down by our native languages... We cannot talk at all except by<br>
subscribing to the organization and classification of data which the<br>
[speech community] decrees,&quot; said Whorf, in LANGUAGE, THOUGHT, AND REALITY<br>
(1956). &quot;The fact of the matter is that the 'real world' is to a large<br>
extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group,&quot; said<br>
Sapir. <br>
<br>
Both were students of Amerindian languages, and were drawn to this<br>
conclusion by analysis of the grammatical categories and semantic<br>
distinctions found in these languages, fascinatingly different from those<br>
found in European ones. (Neither linguist used the term 'Sapir-Whorf<br>
hypothesis', however; Whorf referred to the 'linguistic relativity<br>
principle'. Moreover, the principle was almost entirely elaborated by<br>
Whorf alone.)<br>
<br>
The idea enjoyed a certain vogue in the mid-20th century, not only among linguists but<br>
among anthropologists, psychologists, and science fiction writers.<br>
<br>
However, the strong form of the hypothesis is not now widely believed. The<br>
conceptual systems of one language, after all, can be explained and<br>
understood by speakers of another. And grammatical categories do not<br>
really explain cultural systems very well.&nbsp; Indo-European languages make<br>
gender a grammatical category, and their speakers may be sexist-- but<br>
speakers of Turkish or Chinese, languages without grammatical gender, are<br>
not notably less sexist.<br>
<br>
Whorf's analysis of what he called &quot;Standard Average European&quot; languages<br>
is also questionable. E.g. he claims that &quot;the three-tense system of SAE<br>
verbs colors all our thinking about time.&quot; Only English doesn't have three<br>
tenses; it has two, past and present; future events are expressed by the<br>
present (&quot;I see him tomorrow&quot;), or by a modal expression, merely one of a<br>
large class of such synthetic expressions. And for that matter, English<br>
distinguishes more like six than three times (&quot;I had gone, I went, I just<br>
arrived, I'm going, I'm about to go, I'll go&quot;).<br>
<br>
To prove his point, Whorf collected stories of confusions brought about by<br>
language. For instance, a man threw a spent match into what looked like a<br>
pool of water; only there was decomposing waste in the water, and escaping<br>
gas was ignited by the spark-- boom!&nbsp; But it's not clear that any<br>
*linguistic* act is involved here. The man could think the pool looked<br>
like water without thinking of the word 'water'; and he could fail to<br>
notice the flammable vapors without doing any thinking at all. <br>
<br>
A weak form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis-- that language influences<br>
without determining our categories of thought-- still seems reasonable,<br>
and is even backed up by some psychological experiments-- e.g. Kay &<br>
Kempton's finding that, in distinguishing color triads, a pair<br>
distinguished by color names can seem more distinct than a pair with the<br>
'same' name which are actually more divergent optically (American<br>
Anthropologist, March 1984).<br>
<br>
It should be emphasized that, in their willingness to consider the idea<br>
that non-Western people have languages and worldviews that match the<br>
European's in precision and elegance, Sapir and Whorf were far ahead of<br>
their time.<br>
<br>
For a spirited and very readable defense of Whorf, see Suzette Haden<br>
Elgin's THE LANGUAGE IMPERATIVE (2000).<br>

30. Languages keep simplifying-- how did they ever become complex?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [--markrose]<br>
This question starts with an observation: the classical Indo-European <br>
languages, such as Latin, Greek, Old English, and Sanskrit, were highly <br>
inflected, while their modern descendants are not. For instance, French <br>
nouns have entirely lost the Latin case system, and French verbs have lost <br>
entire classes of forms, such as the passive voice. <br>
<br>
It's natural to ask: how did the classical languages get so complex in the <br>
first place? Why are there inflecting languages at all?&nbsp; Why don't they <br>
all become isolating, like Chinese? <br>
<br>
The answer is that there are also complicating tendencies in language. <br>
Habitual idioms can become particles, which can become inflections-- <br>
a process called grammaticalization. <br>
<br>
For instance, the future and conditional tenses in Romance languages don't <br>
derive from classical Latin, but the infinitive plus forms of 'to have'. <br>
French has rather complicated verb clusters (je ne le lui ai pas donne) <br>
which are perhaps best analyzed as single verbs showing both subject and <br>
object agreement. <br>
<br>
Another example is the plethora of cases in Finnish, many of which derive <br>
from postpositions. Roger Lass has pointed out a cycle in Germanic <br>
languages where perfectives are developed, merge with the imperfect, <br>
and are developed anew. <br>
<br>
Chinese is not immune from this phenomenon-- Mandarin already has verbal <br>
particles like perfective le, or nominal particles like the possessive<br>
/adjectivizing de. The diminutive -r even merges with the preceding <br>
syllable; e.g. dian3 + -r --&gt; diar3 'a bit'.<br>
<hr size=2><br>
31. Where did (some word or phrase) come from?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [--markrose]<br>
If you get a snarky response to such questions on sci.lang, it's because <br>
some people think you ought to look in a dictionary first. The American <br>
Heritage Dictionary traces words back (where possible) to Proto-Indo-European; <br>
and the massive Oxford English Dictionary, available at most libraries, <br>
contains not only etymologies but illustrative citations through the centuries. <br>
<br>
When it comes to word and phrase origins, most people's standard of proof <br>
seems to be &quot;Doesn't violate the laws of physics!&quot; But a plausible story is <br>
not a proof. The three most important types of evidence in etymology are <br>
citations, citations, citations. If you have some amusing theory that &quot;the <br>
whole nine yards&quot; derives from haberdashery, or baseball, or mortuaries, <br>
you'd better have appropriate examples from those fields in the right <br>
historical period. <br>
<br>
Anyway, here are brief notes on a few terms that have been asked about <br>
more than once on sci.lang. (Also see the alt.usage.english FAQ.) <br>
<br>
OK <br>
<br>
There's half a dozen explanations for this, but only one correct one, <br>
demonstrated with hundreds of citations by Allen Walker Read in 1964: <br>
OK stands for oll korrect, and dates to a fad for humorous mis-abbreviations <br>
which started in Boston newspapers in 1838. It spread nationwide when <br>
supporters of Martin Van Buren organized the &quot;OK Club&quot; during the 1840 <br>
presidential campaign (giving the term a double meaning, since Van Buren's <br>
nickname was Old Kinderhook). <br>
<br>
Usted <br>
<br>
Some people have wondered if the Spanish formal second person pronoun Usted <br>
came from the Arabic honorific 'usta:dh. It doesn't; it's a well-attested <br>
abbreviation of vuestra merced 'your mercy'. There are transitional forms <br>
such as vuasted, vuesarced, voarced, as well as parallel constructions like <br>
usia from vuestra sen~oria, ucencia from vuestra excelencia. Compare also<br>
Portuguese vossa merce^ --&gt; vosmece^ --&gt; voce^, as well as Catalan voste <br>
and Gallego vostede. Finally, note that the abbreviation Usted doesn't appear <br>
until 130 years after the Moors had been kicked out of Spain. <br>
