However, when Dickens' named was called by Magistrate Christine Grover, he wasn't in the courtroom.<p>Because Brockett did show up for his appearance, Grover had no choice but to dismiss the charges against the Valencia Community College pharmacy technology student. He was charged with speeding and not wearing a seatbelt. The fine alone would have cost Brockett more than $100.<p>But in this case, there was no fine, no points, and no court costs.<p>An Eyewitness News Investigation found that troopers not showing up for court happened hundreds of times in the last half of 2005. A driver clocked going 116 miles per hour got off because the trooper didn't show up. A driver who caused a $33,000 accident also got off because the trooper didn't show up for court.<p>Kenyatta Williams' car was totaled last July by a driver who cut her off at John Young Parkway and the 408. The accident not only cost her the car, but she lost her job as a housekeeper at a local motel because of injuries to her back and foot.<p>To add insult to injury, the trooper didn't show up for court and the driver of the other car got off scot-free.<p>"We have an obligation to show up for court," Williams said, "so he should've showed up in court, too."<p>In a six-month period in Orange County Traffic Court, about 120 different troopers failed to appear, resulting in 650 drivers to go free. In the cases accidents, the damage total reached more than $820,000.<p>FHP said, many times, the trooper didn't get the subpoena that would have called him or her to court.<p>Maj. Cyrus Brown, who commands FHP Troop D, which includes most of Central Florida, said he would like to see a better system put in place at Orange County Traffic Court to ensure troopers do appear when summoned.<p>"I certainly would like to see something in terms of notification from the courts, or Clerk of Courts, in terms of when the troopers fail to appear," said Brown. "That is occurring in other counties within the troop that I am responsible for."<p>FHP also said that is sent many troopers to help with Hurricane Katrina relief and a lack of communication kept court dates from being rescheduled to make sure the troopers would be in town.</TD></TR></TABLE><p>Pics for clicks:<p><IMG SRC="http://www.i10-i110.com/images/pictures/FHP.jpg" BORDER="0"><p><A HREF="http://www.wftv.com/news/9078008/detail.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.wftv.com/news/9078008/detail.html</A><BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Post Title:</B> Re: Troopers Miss Court Dates, Allow Ticketed Drivers To Walk (enriquejcu)<BR><B>Posted by:</B> <I>MagicGLIturbo</I> at 8:27 AM 4-29-2006<HR><BR>lol, how else do you think I have a perfect driving record?

Is the union trying to negotiate for better pay or something? Officers not showing up for court dates has become a historical footnote. The System is so efficient now, these guys have their court dates scheduled in blocks and their work schedules are organized around it.<p>An example: About a year and a half ago, I was written up for no front plate. Instead of just paying the fee, I show up to court with pics of the plate on my car. Saturday morning at 8am I might add. <IMG NAME="icon" SRC="http://vwvortex.com/zeroforum_graphics/mad.gif" BORDER="0">  There are 4 other guys with the same ticket in front of me. None of us has any additional citations. We all assure the judge that we put our plates on. He didn't even ask for proof before dismissing the cases. We paid $10 to the clerk - the end. What a pointless exercise. <IMG NAME="icon" SRC="http://www.vortexmediagroup.com/images/banghead.gif" BORDER="0"><p>The whole thing was setup and arranged ahead of time - no doubt in my mind about that. The excuse in the article that the cops never got their subpeonas is utter crap. <IMG NAME="icon" SRC="http://www.vwvortex.com/vwbb/rolleyes.gif" BORDER="0"> <p><BR><BR>
