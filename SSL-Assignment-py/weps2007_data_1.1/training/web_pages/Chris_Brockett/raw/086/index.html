1. What is <A HREF="news:sci.lang">sci.lang</A> for?

Discussion of the scientific or historical study of human language(s).
Note the "<A HREF="news:sci">sci</A>." prefix.  The main concern here is with _facts_ and
theories accounting for them.

For advice on English usage, see <A HREF="news:alt.usage.english">alt.usage.english</A> or <A HREF="news:misc.writing">misc.writing</A>.
For casual chatter about other languages see <A HREF="news:soc.culture">soc.culture</A>.&lt;whatever&gt;.
Discussion of or in Greek or Latin is available in <A HREF="news:sci.classics">sci.classics</A>.
The <A HREF="news:sci.lang.translation">sci.lang.translation</A> newsgroup focusses on translation and issues of
  concern to translators and interpreters.
The <A HREF="news:comp.ai.nat-lang">comp.ai.nat-lang</A> newsgroup focusses on natural language processing
  by computers.

Like all "<A HREF="news:sci">sci</A>." newsgroups, <A HREF="news:sci.lang">sci.lang</A> is not meant to substitute for
a dictionary or even a college library.  If the answer to your question
can be looked up easily, then do so rather than using the net.
If you don't have a library, then ask away, but explain your situation.
===============================================================================
2. What is linguistics?

  The scientific study of human language, including:
     Phonetics (physical nature of speech)
     Phonology (use of sounds in language)
     Morphology (word formation)
     Syntax (sentence structure)
     Semantics (meaning of words &amp; how they combine into sentences)
     Pragmatics (effect of situation on language use)
  Or, carving it up another way:
     Theoretical linguistics (pure and simple: how languages work)
     Historical linguistics (how languages got to be the way they are)
     Sociolinguistics (language and the structure of society)
     Psycholinguistics (how language is implemented in the brain)
     Applied linguistics (teaching, translation, etc.)
     Computational linguistics (computer processing of human language)

  Some linguists also study sign language, non-verbal communication,
  animal communication, and other topics besides spoken language.
===============================================================================
3. Does linguistics tell people how to speak or write properly?

No.  Linguistics is descriptive, not prescriptive.
Linguistics can often supply facts which help people arrive at a
recommendation or value judgement, but the recommendation or value
judgement is not part of linguistic science itself.
===============================================================================
4. What are some good books about linguistics?

(These are cited by title and author only. Full ordering information
can be obtained from BOOKS IN PRINT, available at most bookstores and
at even the smallest public libraries.)

  CAMBRIDGE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LANGUAGE, by David Crystal (1987) is a good place
     to start if you are new to this field.
  LANGUAGE, by Edward Sapir (1921), is a readable survey of linguistics
     that is still worthwhile despite its age.
  AN INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE, by Fromkin and Rodman (1974), is one of the
     best intro linguistics survey texts.  There are many others.
  CAMBRIDGE TEXTBOOKS IN LINGUISTICS (a series) consists of good,
     modestly priced introductions to all the areas of linguistics.
  Any encyclopedia will give you basic information about widely studied
     languages, alphabets, etc.
===============================================================================
5. How did language originate?

Nobody knows.  Very little evidence is available.
See however D. Bickerton, LANGUAGE AND SPECIES (1990).
===============================================================================
6. What is known about prehistoric language?

Quite a lot, if by "prehistoric" you'll settle for maybe 2000 years
before the development of writing.  (Language is many thousands of years
older than that.)

Languages of the past can be recovered by comparative reconstruction
from their descendants.  The comparative method relies mainly on
pronunciation, which changes very slowly and in highly systematic
ways.  If you apply it to French, Spanish, and Italian, you
reconstruct late colloquial Latin with a high degree of accuracy;
this and similar tests show us that the method works.

Also, if you use the comparative method on unrelated languages,
you get nothing. So comparative reconstruction is a test of whether
languages are related (to a discernible degree).

The ancient languages Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and several others form
a group known as "Indo-European."  Comparative reconstruction from
them gives a language called Proto-Indo-European which was spoken
around 2500 B.C.  Many Indo-European words can be reconstructed with
considerable confidence (e.g., *ekwos 'horse').  The grammar was
similar to Homeric Greek or Vedic Sanskrit.  Similar reconstructions are
available for some other language families, though none has been as
thoroughly reconstructed as Indo-European.
===============================================================================
7. What do those asterisks mean?

Attached to a word, either of 2 things.
An unattested, reconstructed word (such as Indo-European *ekwos);
or an ungrammatical sentence (such as *Himself saw me).

(In a generative rule, such as AP -&gt; Adj (AP)*, it indicates that
an element may be repeated zero or more times.)
===============================================================================
8. How are present-day languages related?
                                                           [--Scott DeLancey]

This is an INCOMPLETE list of some of the world's language families.  More
detailed classifications can be found in Voegelin and Voegelin, CLASSIFICATION
AND INDEX OF THE WORLD'S LANGUAGES (1977), and M. Ruhlen, A GUIDE TO THE
WORLD'S LANGUAGES (1987).  (Note: Ruhlen's classification recognizes a
number of higher-order groups which most linguists regard as speculative).

A language family is a group of languages that have been proven to have
descended from a common ancestral language.  Branches of families likewise
represent groups of languages with a more recent common ancestor.  For
example, English, Dutch, and German have a common ancestor which we label
Proto-West-Germanic, and thus belong to the West Germanic branch of Germanic.
Icelandic and Norwegian are descended from Proto-North Germanic, a separate
branch of Germanic.  All the Germanic languages have a common ancestor,
Proto-Germanic; farther back, this ancestor was descended from Proto-Indo-
European, as were the ancestors of the Italic, Slavic, and other branches.

Not all languages are known to be related to each other.  It is possible that
they are related but the evidence of relationship has been lost; it's also
possible they arose separately.  It is likely that some of the families
listed here will eventually turn out to be related to one another.

While low-level close relationships are easy to demonstrate, higher-order
classification proposals must rely on more problematic evidence and tend to
be controversial.  Recently linguists such as Joseph Greenberg and Vitalij
Shevoroshkin have attracted attention both in linguistic circles and in the
popular press with claims of larger genetic units, such as Nostratic
(comprising Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic) or
Amerind (to include all the languages of the New World except Na-Dene and
Eskimo-Aleut).  Most linguists regard these hypotheses as having a grossly
insufficient empirical foundation, and argue that comparisons at that depth
are not possible using available methods of historical linguistics.

This list isn't intended to be exhaustive, even for families like Germanic
and Italic.  Nor is it the last word on what's a "language"; see question 12.

  Note: English is not descended from Latin.
        English is a Germanic language with a lot of Latin vocabulary,
        borrowed from French in the Middle Ages.

INDO-EUROPEAN

    ALBANIAN:  Albanian
    ARMENIAN:  Armenian
    TOKHARIAN (an extinct language of NW China)
    HITTITE (extinct language of Turkey)

AFRO-ASIATIC
    SEMITIC:  Arabic, Hebrew (not Yiddish; see above), Aramaic, Amharic
      and other languages of Ethiopia
    CHADIC:  languages of northern Africa, e.g. Hausa
    CUSHITIC:  Somali, other languages of eastern Africa
    EGYPTIAN:  Ancient Egyptian
    BERBER:  languages of North Africa

NIGER-KORDOFANIAN:  includes most of the languages of sub-Saharan
    Africa.  Most of the languages are in the NIGER-CONGO branch; the
    most widely known subgroup of N-C is BANTU (Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, etc.)

URALIC
    Finnish, Estonian, Saami (Lapp), Hungarian, and several
    languages of central Russia

MONGOL:  Mongolian, Buryat, Kalmuck, etc.
TURKIC:  Turkish, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, and other languages of Central Asia

    Some linguists group the Mongol and Turkic families together as ALTAIC.
    Rather more controversially, some add Korean and Japanese to this group.

    It has been claimed that URALIC and ALTAIC are related (as URAL-ALTAIC),
    but this idea is not widely accepted.

DRAVIDIAN:  languages of southern India, including Tamil, Telugu, etc.

SINO-TIBETAN
    SINITIC:  Chinese (several "dialects", or arguably distinct languages:
      Mandarin, Wu (Shanghai), Min (Hokkien [Fujian], Taiwanese),
      Yue (Cantonese), Hakka, Gan, Xiang
    TIBETO-BURMAN: Tibetan, Burmese, various languages of Burma,
      China, India, and Nepal

AUSTROASIATIC
    MON-KHMER:  Vietnamese, Khmer (Cambodian), and various minority
      and tribal languages of Southeast Asia
    MUNDA:  tribal languages of eastern India

AUSTRONESIAN
    Malay-Indonesian, other languages of Indonesia (Javanese, etc.)
    Philippine languages: Tagalog, Ilocano, Bontoc, etc.
    Aboriginal languages of Taiwan (Tsou, etc.)
    Polynesian languages: Hawaiian, Maori, Samoan, Tahitian, etc.
    Micronesian:  Chamorro (spoken in Guam), Yap, Truk, etc.
    Malagasy (spoken in Madagascar)
  Most of these languages fall in a branch called MALAYO-POLYNESIAN

JAPANESE:  A number of linguists argue that Japanese is ALTAIC; others,
    that it is most closely related to AUSTRONESIAN, or that it represents
    a mixture of AUSTRONESIAN and ALTAIC elements.

TAI-KADAI:  Thai, Lao, and other languages of southern China and
    northern Burma.  Possibly related to AUSTRONESIAN.
    An outdated hypothesis that TAI is part of SINO-TIBETAN is still
    often found in reference works and introductory texts.

AUSTRALIA:  the Aboriginal languages of Australia are conservatively
    classified into 26 families, the largest being PAMA-NYUNGAN, consisting
    of about 200 languages originally spoken over 80-90% of Australia.

A large number of language families are found in North and South America.
There are numerous proposals which group these into larger units, some of
which will probably be demonstrated in time.  To date no New World language
has been proven to be related to any Old World family.  The larger North
American families include:

ESKIMO-ALEUT:  two Eskimo languages and Aleut.
ATHAPASKAN:  most of the languages of Alaska and northwestern Canada,
    also includes Navajo and Apache.  Eyak (in Alaska) is related to
    Athapaskan; some linguists put these together with Tlingit and Haida
    in a NA-DENE family.
ALGONQUIAN:  most of Canada and the Northeastern U.S., includes
    Cree, Ojibwa, Cheyenne, Blackfoot
IROQUOIAN:  the languages of NY state (Mohawk, Onondaga, etc.) and Cherokee
SIOUAN:  includes Dakota/Lakhota and other languages of the Plains
    and Southeast U.S.
MUSKOGEAN: Choctaw, Alabama, Creek, Mikasuki (Seminole) and other
    languages of the southeast U.S.
UTO-AZTECAN:  a large family in Mexico and the Southwestern U.S.,
    includes Nahuatl (Aztec), Hopi, Comanche, Paiute, etc.
SALISH:  languages of Washington and British Columbia
HOKAN:  languages of California and Mexico; a controversial grouping
PENUTIAN:  languages of California and Oregon; also controversial

Work on documentation and classification of South American languages still
has a long way to go.  Generally recognized families include:

ARAWAKAN, TUCANOAN, TUPI-GUARANI (including Guarani, a national language
of Paraguay), CARIBAN, ANDEAN (including Quechua and Aymara)

LANGUAGE ISOLATES:  A number of languages around the world have never been
successfully shown to be related to any others-- in at least some cases
because any related languages have long been extinct.  The most famous
isolate is Basque, spoken in northern Spain and southern France; it is
apparently a survival from before the Indo-Europeanization of Europe.
===============================================================================
9. Why do  Hebrew and Yiddish
           Japanese and Chinese
           Persian and Arabic
   look so much alike if they aren't related?

Distinguish LANGUAGE from WRITING SYSTEM.
In each of these cases one language has adopted part or all of the
writing system of an unrelated language.

(To a Chinese, English and Finnish look alike, because they're written
in the same alphabet.  Yet they are not historically related.)

An excellent introduction to writing systems is Geoffrey Sampson's
WRITING SYSTEMS (1985).
===============================================================================
10. How do linguists decide that languages are related?           [--markrose]

When linguists say that languages are related, they're not just remarking
on their surface similarity; they're making a technical statement or claim
about their history-- namely, that they can be regularly derived from a
common parent language.

Proto-languages are reconstructed using the comparative method.  The
first stage is to inspect and compare large amounts of vocabulary from the
languages in question.  Where possible we compare entire _paradigms_ (sets
of related forms, such as the those of the present active indicative in
Latin), rather than individual words.

The inspection should yield a set of regular sound correspondences between
the languages.  By regular, we mean that the same correspondences are
consistently observed in identical phonetic environments.  Finally, _sound
changes_ are formulated: language-specific rules which specify how the
original common form changed in order to produce those observed in each
descendent language.

Applying the comparative method to the Romance languages, we might find

  'I sense'  Sard /sento/  French /sa~/   Italian /sento/   Spanish /sjEnto/
  'sleep'         /sonnu/         /som/           /sonno/           /suEn^o/

  'hundred'       /kentu/         /sa~/           /tSento/          /sjEnto/
  'five'          /kimbe/         /sE~k/          /tSinkwe/         /sinko/

  'I run'         /kurro/         /kur/           /korro/           /korro/
  'story'         /kontu/         /ko~t@/         /(rak)konto/      /kuEnto/

and hundreds of similar examples.  We see some correspondences--

  (1)        Sard /s/      French /s/     Italian /s/       Spanish /s/
  (2)             /k/             /s/             /tS/              /s/
  (3)             /k/             /k/             /k/               /k/

but they seem to conflict: does Sard /k/ correspond to Spanish /s/ or /k/?
Does French /s/ correspond to Italian /s/ or /tS/?

In fact we will find that the correspondences are regular, once we observe
that (2) is seen before a front vowel (i or e), while (3) is seen in other
environments.  Alternations within paradigms, such as It. /diko/ 'I say'
vs. /ditSe/ 'says', will help us make and confirm such generalizations.

We may interpret these now-regular correspondences as indicating that an
initial /s/ in the proto-language has been retained in all four languages,
and likewise initial /k/ in Sard; but that /k/ changed to /s/ or /tS/ in
the other languages in the environment of a front vowel.

Actually, this process is iterative.  For instance, at first glance we
might think that German _haben_ and Latin _habere_ 'have' are obvious
cognates.  However, after noting the regular correspondence of German h to
Latin c, we are forced to change our minds, and look to _capere_ 'seize'
as a better cognate for _haben_.

Thus, similarity of words is only a clue, and perhaps a misleading one.
Linguists conclude languages are related, and thus derive from a common
ancestor, only if they find *regular* sound correspondences between them.

To complicate things, derivations may be obscured by irregular changes,
such as dissimilation, borrowing, or analogical change.  For instance,
the normal development of Middle English _kyn_ is 'kine', but this word
has been largely replaced by 'cows', formed from 'cow' (ME _cou_) on the
analogy of word-pairs like stone : stones.  Analogy often serves to reduce
irregularities in a language (here, an unusual plural).

_Borrowing_ refers to taking words from other languages, as English has
taken 'search' and 'garage' from French, 'paternal' from Latin, 'anger' from
Old Norse, and 'tomato' from Nahuatl.  How do we know that English doesn't
derive from French or Nahuatl?  The latter case is easy to eliminate:
regular sound correspondences can't be set up between English and Nahuatl.

But English has borrowed so heavily from French that regular correspondences
do occur.  Here, however, we find that the French borrowings are thickest in
government, legal, and military domains; while the basic vocabulary (which
languages borrow less frequently) is more akin to German.  Paradigmatic
correspondences like sing/sang/sung vs. singen/sang/gesungen also help show
that the Germanic words are inherited, the French ones borrowed.
===============================================================================
11. What is Noam Chomsky's transformational grammar all about?

Several things; it really comprises several layers of theory:

(1) The hypothesis that much of the structure of human language is
inborn ("built-in") in the human brain, so that a baby learning to
talk only has to learn the vocabulary and the structural "parameters"
of his native language -- he doesn't have to learn how language works
from scratch.

This is widely (but not universally) believed; the main evidence consists of:
   - The fact that babies learn to talk remarkably well from what seems
     to be inadequate exposure to language; it can be shown in detail
     that babies acquire some rules of grammar that they could never
     have "learned" from what is available to them, if the structure of
     language were not partly built-in.
   - The fact that the structure of language on different levels
     (vocabulary, ability to connect words, etc.) can be lost by injury
     to specific areas of the brain.
   - The fact that there are unexpected structural similarities between
     all known languages.
For detailed exposition see Cook, CHOMSKY'S UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR (1988),
Newmeyer, GRAMMATICAL THEORY: ITS LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES (1983), and
Pinker, THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT (1994).

(2) The hypothesis that to adequately describe the grammar of a human
language, you have to give each sentence at least two different structures,
called "deep structure" and "surface structure", together with rules
called "transformations" that relate them.

This is hotly debated.  Some theories of grammar use two levels and
some don't.  Chomsky's original monograph, SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES (1957),
is still well worth reading; this is what it deals with.

(3) Chomsky's name is associated with specific flavors of transformational
grammar.  The model elaborated over the last few years is called GB
(government and binding) theory; however, Chomsky's 1995 book on Minimalism
contains significant departures from earlier work in GB.

Bill Turkel (<A HREF="mailto:bill@hivnet.ubc.ca">bill@hivnet.ubc.ca</A>) runs a mailing list on Minimalism; e-mail
him for more information.

(4) Some people think Chomsky is the source of the idea that grammar ought
to be viewed with mathematical precision.  (Thus there are occasional
vehement anti-Chomsky polemics such as THE NEW GRAMMARIAN'S FUNERAL, which
are really polemics against grammar per se.)

Although Chomsky contributed some valuable techniques, grammarians have
_always_ believed that grammar was a precise, mechanical thing.  They
are highly divided, however, on the nature and function of those mechanisms!
===============================================================================
12. What is a dialect?
                                                              [--M.C. + M.R.]
A dialect is any variety of a language spoken by a specific community of
people. Most languages have many dialects.

Everyone speaks a dialect.  In fact everyone speaks an _idiolect_, i.e.,
a personal language.  (Your English language is not quite the same as
my English language, though they are probably very, very close.)

A group of people with very similar idiolects are considered to be
speaking the same dialect.  Some dialects, such as Standard American
English, are taught in schools and used widely around the world.
Others are very localized.

Localized or uneducated dialects are _not_ merely failed attempts to speak
the standard language.  William Labov and others have demonstrated, for
example, that the speech of inner-city blacks has its own intricate
grammar, quite different in some ways from that of Standard English.

It should be emphasized that linguists do not consider some dialects
superior to others-- though speakers of the language may do so;
and linguists do study people's attitudes toward language, since
these have a strong effect on the development of language.

Linguists call varieties of language "dialects" if the speakers can
understand each other and "languages" if they can't.  For example,
Irish English and Southern American English are dialects of English,
but English and German are different languages (though related).

This criterion is not always as easy to apply as it sounds.
Intelligibility may vary with familiarity and interest, or may depend
on the subject.  A more serious problem is the _dialect continuum_: a
chain of dialects such that any two adjoining dialects are mutually
intelligible, but the dialects at the ends are not.  Speakers of
Belgian Dutch, for instance, can't understand Swiss German, but
between them there lies a continuum of mutually intelligible dialects.

Sometimes the use of the terms "language" or "dialect" is politically
motivated.  Norwegian and Danish (being mutually intelligible) are
dialects of the same language, but are considered separate languages
because of their political independence.  By contrast, Mandarin and
Cantonese, which are mutually unintelligible, are often referred to
as "dialects" of Chinese, due to the political and cultural unity of
China, and because they share a common _written_ language.

Because of such problems, some linguists reject the mutual
intelligibility criterion; but they do not propose to return to
arguments on political and cultural grounds.  Instead, they prefer
not to speak of dialects and languages at all, but only of different
varieties, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.
===============================================================================
13. Are all languages equally complex, or are some more primitive than others?
                                                              [--M.C. + M.R.]
In the last century many people believed that so-called "primitive
peoples" would have primitive languages, and that Latin and Greek--
or their own languages-- were inherently superior to other tongues.

In fact, however, there is no correlation between type or complexity of
culture and any measure of language complexity.  Peoples of very simple
material culture, such as the Australian Aborigines, are often found to
speak very complex languages.

Obviously, the size of the vocabulary and the variety and sophistication of
literary forms will depend on the culture.  The _grammar_ of all languages,
however, tends to be about equally complex-- although the complexity may
be found in different places.  Latin, for instance, has a much richer
system of inflections than English, but a less complicated syntax.

As David Crystal puts it, "All languages meet the social and psychological
needs of their speakers, are equally deserving of scientific study, and can
provide us with valuable information about human nature and society."

The only really simple languages are _pidgins_, which result when speakers
of different languages come to live and work together.  Vocabulary is drawn
from one or both languages, and a very forgiving grammar devised.  Grammars
of pidgins from around the world have interesting similarities (e.g. they
are likely to use repetition to express plurals).

A pidgin becomes a _creole_ when children acquire it as a native language;
as it evolves to meet the needs of a primary language, its vocabulary and
grammar become much richer.  If a pidgin is used over a long period (for
example, Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea), it may similarly develop into a
more complex language known as an _extended pidgin_.

14. What about artificial languages, such as Esperanto?          [--markrose]

Hundreds of constructed languages have been devised in the last few centuries.
Early proposals, such as those of Lodwick (1647), Wilkins, or Leibniz, were
attempts to devise an ideal language based on philosophical classification
of concepts, and used wholly invented words.  Most were too complex to learn,
but one, Jean Francois Sudre's Solresol, achieved some popularity in the last
century; its entire vocabulary was built from the names of the notes of
the musical scale, and could be sung as well as spoken.

Later the focus shifted to languages based on existing languages, with a
polyglot (usually European) vocabulary and a simplified grammar, whose purpose
was to facilitate international communication.  Johann Schleyer's Volapu"k
(1880) was the first to achieve success; its name is based on English
("world-speech"), and reflects Schleyer's notions of phonetic simplicity.

It was soon eclipsed by Ludwig Zamenhof's Esperanto (1887), whose grammar
was simpler and its vocabulary more recognizable.  Esperanto has remained
the most successful and best-known artificial language, with a million or
more speakers and a voluminous literature; children of Esperantists have
even learned it as a native language.

Its relative success hasn't prevented the appearance of new proposals, such
as Ido, Interlingua, Occidental, and Novial.  There have also been attempts
to simplify Latin (Latino Sine Flexione, 1903) and English (Basic English,
1930) for international use.  The recent Loglan and Lojban, based on
predicate logic, may represent a revival of a priori language construction.

16. What about those Eskimo words for snow? (and other myths about language)
                                                               [--markrose]

   "The Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow."

This story is constantly being repeated, with various numbers given,
despite the fact that it has no basis at all.  No one who repeats this
pseudo-factoid can list the hundreds of words for you, or even cite a
work that does.  They just heard it somewhere.

The anthropologist Laura Martin has traced the development of this myth
(including the steady growth in the number of words claimed).  Geoffrey
Pullum summarizes her report in THE GREAT ESKIMO VOCABULARY HOAX (1991).

How many words are there really?  Well, the Yup'ik language in particular
has about two dozen roots describing snow or things related to snow.  This
is not particularly significant; English can amass about the same total:
snow, sleet, slush, blizzard, flurry, avalanche, powder, hardpack,
snowball, snowman, and other derivatives.

The Yup'ik total could be greatly expanded by other derived words, since
the Inuit languages can form hundreds of words from a single root.  But
this is true of all words in the language (and indeed of all agglutinative
languages), not just the words for snow.

   "There's a town in Appalachia that speaks pure Elizabethan English."

There isn't.  All languages, everywhere, are constantly changing.  Some
areas speak more conservative dialects, but we know of no case where
people speak exactly as their ancestors spoke centuries ago.

Of course, ancient languages are sometimes revived; biblical Hebrew has
been revived (with some modifications) in modern Israel; and there's a
village in India in which Sanskrit is being taught as an everyday
language.  But these are conscious revivals of languages which have
otherwise died out in everyday use, not survivals of living languages.

   "Chinese characters directly represent ideas, not spoken words."

Westerners have been taken by this notion for centuries, ever since
missionaries started describing the Chinese writing system.  However, it's
quite false.  Chinese characters represent specific Chinese words.

(To be precise, almost all characters represent a particular syllable with
a particular meaning; about 10% however represent one syllable of a
particular two-syllable word.)

The vast majority of characters consist of a _phonetic_ giving the
approximate pronunciation of the word, plus a _signific_ giving a clue to
its meaning (thus distinguishing different syllables having different
meanings).  As an added difficulty, many of the phonetics are no longer
helpful, because of sound changes since the characters were devised, over
2000 years ago.  However, it is estimated that 60% of the phonetics still
give useful information about the character's pronunciation.

To be sure, Japanese (among other languages) uses Chinese characters too,
and it is a very different language from Chinese.  However, we must look
at exactly how the Japanese use the Chinese characters.  Generally they
borrowed both the characters and the words represented; it's rather as if
when we borrowed words like _psychology_ from Greek, we wrote them in the
Greek alphabet.  Native Japanese words are also written using the Chinese
characters for the closest Chinese words: if the Japanese word overlaps
several Chinese words, different characters must be written in different
contexts, according to the meanings in Chinese.

A good demythologizing of common notions about Chinese writing is found in
THE CHINESE LANGUAGE: FACT AND FANTASY, by John DeFrancis (1984).

   "German lost out to English as the US's official language by 1 vote."

This entertaining story is also told of Greek, Latin, and even Hebrew.

There was never any such vote.  Dennis Baron, in THE ENGLISH ONLY QUESTION
(1990), thinks the legend may have originated with a 1795 vote concerning
a proposal to publish federal laws in German as well as English.  At one
point a motion to table discussion (rather than referring the matter back
to committee) was defeated 41-40.  The proposal was eventually defeated.

   "Sign language isn't really a language."
   "ASL is a gestural version of English."

Sign languages are true languages, with vocabularies of thousands of words,
and grammars as complex and sophisticated as those of any other language,
though with fascinating differences from speech.  If you think they are
merely pantomime, try watching a mathematics lecture, a poetry reading, or
a religious service conducted in Sign, and see how much you understand.

ASL (American Sign Language) is not an invented system like Esperanto; it
developed gradually and naturally among the Deaf.  It has no particular
relation to English; the best demonstration of this is that it is quite
different from British Sign.  Curiously enough, it is most closely related
to French Sign Language, due to the influence of Laurent Clerc, who came
from Paris in 1817 to be the first teacher of the Deaf in the US.

ASL is not to be confused with Signed English, which is a word-for-word
signed equivalent of English.  Deaf people tend to find it tiring, because
its grammar, like that of spoken languages, is linear, while that of ASL is
primarily spatial.

For more on Sign and the Deaf community, see Oliver Sacks' SEEING VOICES
(1989), or Harlan Lane, WHEN THE MIND HEARS (1984).

20. Is English a creole?
                                                                [--markrose]
The change from Anglo-Saxon to Modern English (loss of gender and of
case inflection, phonological change, acquisition of a huge stock of French
and Latin vocabulary) is certainly dramatic, and has led some <A HREF="news:sci.lang">sci.lang</A>
posters, and even some linguists (e.g. Domingue, Bailey &amp; Maroldt,
Milroy) to the provocative suggestion that English suffered pidginization
or creolization at the time of the Norman Conquest (1066) or the Norse
invasions (from 865), or both.

This hypothesis, as Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman have
shown in LANGUAGE CONTACT, CREOLIZATION, AND GENETIC LINGUISTICS (1988),
rests on an incomplete understanding of creolization and a shaky grasp on
the history of English.  There is a wide range of language contact
situations, from casual contact to deep structural interference; English is
by no means the most striking of these cases.  It looks like a creole only
if one ignores this range of phenomena and labels any case of moderate
interference as creolization.

For many of the changes in question, the chronology does not work out.
For instance, the reduction of unstressed vowels to /@/, largely responsible
for the loss of Old English nominal declensions, had taken place *before*
the Conquest, and affected all of England, including areas never settled
by the Norse.  And English did absorb an immense amount of French and
Latin vocabulary, but most of this occurred well *after* the Conquest--
past 1450, two centuries after the nobility ceased to be French-speaking.

Other points to note: 1) most of the simplifications and foreign borrowings
seen in English occurred as well in other Germanic languages, notably
Dutch, Low German, and the Scandinavian languages; 2) a particularly
striking borrowing from Norse, the pronoun 'they', was probably adopted
to avoid what otherwise would have been a merge of 'he/him' with 'they/them';
3) the total number of French-speaking invaders was not more than
50,000, compared to an English-speaking population of over 1.5 million--
nowhere near the proportions that would threaten the normal inheritance
of English.

21. How do you look up a word in a Chinese or Japanese dictionary?
                                                                [--markrose]

The vast majority of Chinese characters can be divided into two parts, the
radical and the phonetic.  Each part is another, simpler character.  The
_radical_ gives an idea of the meaning-- rather a vague idea, since
traditionally there were only 214 different radicals.  The _phonetic_
identifies the sound, with a bit more precision: generally, all the
characters that share a phonetic rhymed 2000 years ago in Archaic Chinese.

(It's impossible to give examples in ASCII; see the Web page for more:
<A HREF="http://www.tezcat.com/~markrose/lang21.html">http://www.tezcat.com/~markrose/lang21.html</A>)

Characters are arranged in most Chinese dictionaries by radical.  To find
an unknown character, then, you identify the radical, and look up its
section in the dictionary.  The radicals are arranged in order of increasing
complexity.  Each radical's section is ordered by the number of strokes in
the character.  Several characters may have the same number of strokes;
these must simply be scanned till the right one is found.

Sometimes it isn't easy to identify the radical-- it's in an odd position
(e.g. on the bottom or the right rather than the top or left side); or it's
drawn in an abbreviated form; or it's not clear which of several similar
radicals the character is listed under.  It's also important to know the
proper method for counting strokes.

If a character isn't composed of a radical + phonetic, it's usually treated
as one, graphically, for the purposes of dictionary lookup.  For instance,
the character for hao3 'good' is composed of the characters for 'woman' and
'child'-- a _semantic_ compound.  It's simply listed under the 'woman'
radical, although zi3 'child' is not its phonetic.

The People's Republic simplified a number of characters and radicals, and
this changed the number of radicals-- there's 224 in my dictionary, for
instance.  The Japanese have made their own separate simplification.

22. What about Nostratic and Proto-World?
                                                                [--markrose]
In recent years some some linguists have attempted to reconstruct languages
far older than Indo-European.

*Nostratic*, said to underlie the Indo-European, Kartvelian (South Caucasion),
Afro-Asiatic, Dravidian, Uralic, Altaic, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo-Aleut
families, was first proposed by Holger Pedersen in 1903.  More recently
the greater part of work on Nostratic is due to Soviet linguists led by
Vladislav Illich-Svitych, Aaron Dolgopolsky, and Vitaly Shevoroshkin.

The methodology is the traditional comparative method, and over 600 roots
have been proposed.  Most linguists remain skeptical, believing that chance
processes will have obscured any relationship at this level beyond
reconstruction, or question the accuracy of the derivations (a charge which
makes Nostraticists bristle).   Others simply suspend judgment, especially
since much of the supporting material for Nostratic is available only in
Russian.

A good overview on Nostratic is Kaiser and Shevoroshkin, "Nostratic", in
the _Annual Review of Anthropology_, 17:309.  Illich-Svitych's original
Russian article (from _Etymologia_, 1965) has been translated in
Shevoroshkin, ed., RECONSTRUCTING LANGUAGES AND CULTURES (1989).

Joseph Greenberg has proposed a grouping which covers much the same language
areas (omitting Afro-Asiastic and Dravidian, but adding Ainu and Gilyak),
called *Eurasiatic*.  Greenberg's method of _mass comparison_ (which he has
also used to group together almost all Native American languages into one
superfamily, Amerind) basically consists of assembling huge lists of
common words and doing eyeball comparisons.

This methodology has been severely criticized by many historical linguists.
If 'mass comparison' were applied to the Indo-European languages, it would
be bedevilled by false positives (caused by borrowing or chance) and by
specious phonetic or semantic similarites.  Greenberg's methods seem to
linguists to abandon the very methodological severity which has put
Indo-European linguistics on a scientific footing, and distinguished it from
the work of cranks.  Relax the rules enough, and you can derive any language
from any other.

Greenberg replies that the patterns he has found are compelling enough to
justify his methods, and that he is merely following in the footsteps of
the originators of the comparative method: linguists had to decide that the
Indo-European languages were related before attempting reconstructions.

The ultimate areal comparison would be *Proto-World*, the hypothetical
ancestor of all human languages.  Greenberg has mentioned Proto-World, but
since he is not much interested in reconstruction, his proposal is not much
more than a statement of the monogenetic theory (a single origin for all
languages).  Most linguists are skeptical that anything could be
reconstructed at this hypothetical time depth.

Greenberg's work on Amerind can be found in LANGUAGE IN THE AMERICAS (1987);
on Eurasiatic, in the forthcoming INDO-EUROPEAN AND ITS CLOSEST RELATIVES:
THE EURASIATIC LANGUAGE FAMILY.  Introductions to the Nostratic and
Proto-World controversies were published in both _The Atlantic_ and
_Scientific American_ in April 1991.  The essays in Lamb and Mitchell, eds.,
SPRUNG FROM SOME COMMON SOURCE (1991), are also relevant.

Loren Petrich maintains an annotated bibliography on Indo-European,
Nostratic, and Proto-World.  I am also indebted to Peter Michalove for
citations used in this entry.

23.  What are phonemes and why's it so hard to lose a foreign accent?
                                                                [--markrose]
The sounds (*phones*) humans can make are infinite; between any two phones,
there's (almost always) a continuum of phones in between them.

In any one language, however, phones are grouped into 20 to 60 or so discrete
groups of sounds called *phonemes*. The range of variation for each phoneme
is discounted by speakers and hearers of the language, who perceive the
entire range as "the same sound."

The English phoneme /p/ has two phonetic realizations or *allophones*:
aspirated [ph] beginning a word and non-aspirated [p] elsewhere. But
since the two types of /p/ never distinguish one word from another, speakers
of English generally don't even notice the difference. (Linguists
write phonemic transcriptions between /slashes/, and phonetic transcriptions
in [brackets].)

If we can find two words with different meaning but only one difference in
sound between them-- a *minimal pair*-- then we've found distinct phonemes;
e.g. /p/ and /b/ in English 'pit' and 'bit'. If two sounds never occur in
the same phonetic environment (e.g. English [p] and [ph])-- if they're in
*complementary distribution*-- then they're probably allophones of a single
phoneme.  (I say 'probably' because English [h] and [ng] are also in
complementary distribution, but linguists balk at assigning them to one
phoneme.)

Other languages do not divide up the phonetic space in the same way.  For
instance, /p/ and /ph/ are separate phonemes in Mandarin Chinese (as in
/pa1/ 'eight' and /pha1/ 'flower').  And the vowels of 'late' and 'let',
phonemes in English, are allophones of a single phoneme /e/ in Spanish.

We're trained from childhood to make the phonetic distinctions our language
uses to keep its phonemes apart, and to ignore those it doesn't.
Learning to make different distinctions in a foreign language is quite
difficult-- usually harder than making new sounds our native language lacks
entirely.  We'll continue to have an accent in the new language so long as
we hear its sounds through our native language's phonemic filter.
