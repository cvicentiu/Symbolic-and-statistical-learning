						Also chipping in for SHS in the scoring column was TJ Dineen (2 goals), Paul Caso (2 goals) , Adam Mendenhall and Cole Johnson with single tallies.<br />

							Leading the way for the black &amp; gold was senior captain Mike Caso with 2 goals and 2 assists. Not to be outdone by big brother, sophmore forward Paul Caso chipped in with a goal and 2 assists. Alain Labbe added his team leading 10th goal of the season to spot SHS an opening lead with a pretty short side tally. Jamey Silvia-Chandley also lite the lamp with his patented spin o rama from in the slot. Other helpers went to Adam Mendenhall and Shea Burke. Special recognition for the game goes to the defensive pairing of Burke and Geoff Crawford and the defensive play of forwards Mendenhall and Silvia-Chandley. Goalie Joey Giarrusso was solid in the pipes with 27 saves for the victors.<br />

							After a scoreless 1st period, TJ Dineen posted the Sabers to a 1-0 lead with a nice rush and a swift back hander that fooled Somersworth goalie, Derek Lambert (36 saves). The Hilltoppers would then tie it up on a shorthanded tally by Bryan Hogan and then take the lead with only 13 seconds remaining in the period off a funny bounce in front.<br />
							Despite tremendous pressure in the 3rd stanza the Sabers were unable to find the back of the net against the blue &amp; white. At 9:35 of the period Somersworth would net a disputed goal with the Souhegan net displaced from it’s hinges.<br />
							Goalie Joey Giarrusso was outstanding for the Black &amp; Gold with 27 quality saves.<br />
							Special recognition goes to the defensive pairing of Dineen and Larry Engholm, and defensive forwards Adam Mendenhall and Jamey Silvia-Chandley.<br />
							Team USA members Dineen and Mike Caso were courageous in their game participation after having attented the wake and funeral of their fallen friend and teammate.<br />

							The Souhegan Sabers competed with over thiry track teams at the jam- packed UNH facility on January 21. No team scores were kept in the meet billed as a qualifying meet for the Class Meets scheduled in two weeks.<br />
							Notable performances were recorded in several events for the Sabers. The tandem team of Tyler Petropulos and Angela Stauble led the way with a photo finish in the 600 meters with Tyler being the victor with 1:45.5 and Angela back two tenths of a second. They also teamed up with Laura Tebbetts and Mollie Raymond to record the fastest time of the day in the 4 by 160 relay - 1:28.4. That time is the fastest time by the Souhegan girls’ team in over ten years, nearly eclipsing the school record of 1:28.0. That time will also seed them at or near the top for the Class Meet.<br />
							Other top performances by the Sabers were Chandler Wallisch, fourth in the shot at 31’ 0” and Chantal Croteau, fifth in the 1500 meters with a time of 4:57.8. Teydin Hall recorded a sixth place in the 300 meters with a seasonal best of 45.5. The other placement in the top six for the girls’ team was the 4 by 400 relay squad of<br />
							Molly Mirhashem, Brianna Pomeroy, Amy Ferguson, and Teydin Hall with a clocking of 4:34.6. In the boys’ meet Zak Warren recorded fourth place finishes in the high hurdles(8.5) and high jump(5’ 10”0, and Jon Harris placed sixth in the long jump with a season best of 19’ 2”. The boys’ 4 by 400 team of Jon Harris, Ben Lawrence, Sam Lawrence, and Spencer Bapst ran well finishing sixth in 3:50.1.<br />
							The teams travel to UNH again next week for the final qualifying meet, then the Class Meet will be held at Dartmouth on Friday, February 2.</font></p>

							Tom Anderson (SWIMMING) Tom has really added speed to the Sabers team. In the past 2 weeks Tom has been a double winner in his events the 50 and 100 free as well as leading both 200 free and 200 IM relays to wins. Tom also holds school records in the 100 free, 50 free 200 free relay and 200 IM relay. Tom is having a great year, qualifying for state championships and pushing the limit on breaking one of his records from last year. In the Hollis/Brookline no one could come close and the other Souhegan swimmers helped him sweep the 50 free and 100 free events. Tom will make this an exciting year.<br />
							Chantal Croteau (INDOOR TRACK) Chantal set a school record in the 1500 meters on Saturday, December 30 at UNH. Her time of 5:03.9 was a second faster than her existing record of a year ago, and was strong enough for a third place finish in the tough race. She also ran the 1000 meters and finished third in that race. Her doubling up with both events enabled the team to finish second in the eleven team meet.</font></p>

									<strong>Mike Caso </strong>(ICE HOCKEY) Look out D3, Senior Captain Mike Caso is hot. Mike has found his scoring touch and netted 5 goals and 4 assists this week in victories over Pembroke (5-3) and Portsmouth (14-5). Mike continues to be amongst the best players on the ice for SHS and leaque wide in every game. His hustle, back checking and puck possesion is fantastic.<br />
									<strong>TJ Dineen</strong> (ICE HOCKEY) The Jr. Defenseman had an outstanding week for the skating Sabers scoring SHS lone goal in a narrow 3-1 loss to Somersworth on a magnificent coast-coast rush and netting two goals against Portsmouth in a 14-5 rout. TJ is playing outstanding hockey in every zone and has been a rock solid physical presence on the blue line. TJ is playing some of the best hockey we have seen from him in the Sabers black &amp; gold.<br />
									<strong>Alain Labbe</strong> (ICE HOCKEY) Alain netted 6 goals and 2 assists this week in wins over Pembroke (5-3) and Portsmouth (14-5). With a monster 5 goal game versus Portsmouth, Alain demonstrated that he is one of the penultimate power forwards in the division. With bone charring checks on Clipper star Tyler Schwartzmiller and strong on face offs, Alain has notified the leaque that Souhegan will be a force to be reckowned with down the stretch.<br />
									<strong>Ben Lawrence</strong> (INDOOR TRACK) Ben continued his fine sprinting for the track and field team this week. On Sunday competing with ten other Class I M &amp; S teams at Southern Maine University in Gorham, Maine he finished fourth in the 55 meter dash with a quick 6.8 in the 55 meter dash. He also ran the second fastest time on the 4 by 400 relay team, and that team was a strong second in the large meet. On Thursday at the mini-meet held at the Hampshire Dome, Ben stepped out of his usual sprinting shoes into middle distance with much success. He ran the fastest leg (2:15) on the 4 by 800 meter relay team, allowing that team to run a combined time of 9:30.3, their best time of the year. Ben’swillingness to run events out of his comfort zone shows a positive team commitment.<br />
									<strong>ANNA BOLTON</strong> (Girls’ Basketball) - Anna scored a team- and season-high 11 points on 4 of 5 shooting and added 3 assists in the Sabers blowout win over ConVal. On Friday Anna contributed 5 points and had 3 assists as a tough Bow team defeated Souhegan.<br />

									Kelsie Helber (NORDIC SKI) In Saturday’s New Hampshire Nordic Coaches race Kelsie Helberg cracked the top 25, placing 24 out of a field that included female competitors from all New Hampshire public and private high schools.

Kelsie helped lead her team to a 5th place finish out of the 18 scoring schools.<br />
									<strong>LINDSAY BOCK</strong> (Girls’ Basketball) Lindsay scored two points, grabbed 5 rebounds, and added 2 steals and an assist in Souhegan’s comeback victory over Lebanon.

Lindsay added 2 steals and a blocked shot while playing every minute of the second half.<br />
									Grant Davis (SWIMMING) Grant has added great depth to the team this year. Grant picked up 2nd place in the 200 free, 100 back and 100 free at our last two meets. Grant is part of many of the sweeps the Sabers have in the 100 free and 100 back events. He works hard during both in his practices and at all the meets. Grant will be with the team at NHIAA states in the 200 free and is close in the 100 free and 100 back.

									<strong>Marissa Soucy</strong> (SWIMMING) Marissa has always given extra to the team when she competes. Marissa has really grown on the team this year making states with the 50 free and soon to get in with her 100 free time. She works so hard in practice pushing herself as hard as all of the Animals in her lane. She had her best meet at the Goffstown meet pickup a 2nd and 3rd in her events and swimming her best times. Just as she puts effort into her individual events she adds speed to the relays. Her 4-x100 relay is consistently first or second in the meets with Marissa driving the team.<br />
