<PRE>



I'm keyboarding a book on Armenian proximal deixis for my major
professor and am having a few problems with the formats. The
publishers in Germany want it on disk in WordPerfect 5.1, which is
making it difficult to produce some of the special characters I
need. Since the instructions were in German (which I can barely make
out with a dictionary), this is getting a little complicated.

I think there might have been reference made to an additional program
called Polyglott, but neither I nor anyone I've talked to has heard of
it. Is it possibly a font that helps with special characters? From
the context of the instructions, it's difficult to know what this
`Polyglott' is.

Has anyone heard of a program by this name? If you can shed some light
on this and save a struggling grad student, please contact me.

One of our students, an English major, has asked me where she might
apply for graduate study that would include both linguistics and
literature, including a course, or program of courses, in the area of
linguistic/literary stylistics. She hopes to enter an English
Department where she can take work in the structure and history of
English, as well as in stylistics, and in her continuing study of
literature in English. The real question here is whether there are
English departments that offer work in the specialized area of
stylistics. Such study is possible at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison English Department, though the offerings are pretty
slim in stylistics. Are there other English departments where this
kind of study is possible? I will post a summary of replies, even if
there are no replies! Thanks in advance.

<STRONG>Subject:</STRONG> Q: help locating brain/language references<BR>
<PRE>


Being hounded to turn in a long overdue chapter for a book edited by
some friends, I am procrastinating by attempting to track down a
couple of references that were made during the discussions at a
conference I attended a few months ago:

1. An (EEG?) study (or series of studies) of reading acquisition that
indicate that four-year-olds have no visual word form system, that
word-like stimuli begin to show some adult-like wave amplification in
seven-year olds, and that it is not until English-speaking children
reach the age of about 10 years that they exhibit the same wave form
patterns as in adults.

2. An ERP (?) study of syntactic (?) operations in immigrants to the
United States that indicated that those arriving at ages 1-3 show
left-hemisphere lateralization indistinguishable from native speakers,
while those arriving at ages 4-11 show increasingly greater right
hemisphere involvement, and those who arrived after age 11 employ both
hemispheres roughly equally.

I have been unable to locate these in the Eric, Medline or Psyc
databases. This may mean that they represent unpublished or
forthcoming work, or technical reports.

If any Linguist List subscribers recognize either of the studies, and
can provide me with information as to authors, sources, etc. , I would
appreciate receiving a brief e-mail.

Thank you.
