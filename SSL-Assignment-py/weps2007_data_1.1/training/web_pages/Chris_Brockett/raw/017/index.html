Full Title: ACL 05 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages <br> <br> Date: 29-Jun-2005 - 29-Jun-2005 <br> Location: Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America <br> Contact Person: Mona Diab <br> Meeting Email: midab<img src='address-marker.gif' width='20' height='20' align='absbottom'>cs.columbia.edu <br> <br> Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics <br> <br> Language Family(ies): Unclassified Central Semitic <br> <br> Call Deadline: 10-Apr-2005 <br> <br> Meeting Description: <br> <br> CALL FOR PAPERS <br> <br> ACL 2005 WORKSHOP ON <br> COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO SEMITIC LANGUAGES <br> University of Michigan, Ann Arbor <br> June 29, 2005 <br> <br> Submission Deadline April 10 2005 <br> <br> WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION <br> <br> The Semitic family includes many languages and dialects spoken by a large number <br> of native speakers (around 300 Million). However, Semitic languages are still <br> understudied. The most prominent members of this family are Arabic and its <br> dialects, Hebrew, Amharic, Aramaic, Maltese and Syriac. Beyond their shared <br> ancestry which is apparent through pervasive cognate sharing, a common <br> characteristic of these languages is the rich and productive pattern-based <br> morphology and similar syntactic constructions. <br> <br> An increasing body of computational linguistics work is starting to appear for <br> both Arabic and Hebrew. Arabic alone, as the largest member of the Semitic <br> family, has been receiving a lot of attention lately in terms of dedicated <br> workshops and conferences. These include, but are not limited to, the workshop <br> on Arabic Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2002), a special session on <br> Arabic processing in Traitement Automatique du Langage Naturel (TALN 2004), the <br> Workshop on Computational Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages (COLING <br> 2004), and the NEMLAR Arabic Language Resources and Tools Conference in Cairo, <br> Egypt (2004). This phenomenon has been coupled with a relative surge in <br> resources for Arabic due to concerted efforts by the LDC and ELDA/ELRA. However, <br> there is an apparent lag in the development of resources and tools for other <br> Semitic languages. Often, work on individual Semitic languages, unfortunately, <br> still tends to be done with limited awareness of ongoing research in other <br> Semitic languages. Within the last four years, only three workshops addressed <br> Semitic languages: an ACL 2002 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic <br> Languages and an MT Summit IX Workshop on Machine Translation for Semitic <br> Languages in 2003, and the EAMT 2004, held in Malta, had a special session on <br> Semitic languages. <br> <br> This workshop is a sequel to the ACL 2002 workshop and shares its goals of: <br> <br> (i) heightening awareness amongst Semitic-language researchers of shared <br> breakthroughs and challenges, <br> (ii) highlighting issues common to all Semitic languages as much as possible, <br> (iii) encouraging the potential for developing coordinated approaches; and <br> (iv) in addition, leveraging resource and tool creation for less prominent <br> members of the Semitic language family. <br> <br> WORKSHOP TOPICS <br> <br> We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues: <br> <br> - Computational approaches to phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and <br> pragmatics of Semitic languages <br> - Applications for Semitic languages such as, but not limited to, machine <br> translation, summarization and information retrieval <br> - Tools for processing of Semitic languages (e.g. POS taggers, parsers, etc.) <br> - Empirical studies of unique/specific phenomena in Semitic languages <br> - Creating computational resources for Semitic languages <br> - Comparative computational studies of Semitic languages <br> - Leveraging resources in other languages (Semitic or other) to create resources <br> and tools for Semitic languages <br> <br> While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics, or related <br> issues, we particularly welcome work involving Semitic languages with scarce <br> resources. <br> <br> WORKSHOP FORMAT <br> <br> The workshop will last for one day, June 29th, and will consist of: <br> <br> - An invited talk (by Salim Roukos, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center) <br> - Several sessions of regular paper presentations <br> - A panel discussion drawing on aspects of the participating papers and their <br> implications for future collaboration and coordination <br> <br> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <br> <br> Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages, formatted <br> following the ACL 2005 guidelines <br> (<A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles">http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles</A>).

The concepts <br> of entailment and paraphrase are useful in characterizing these relationships. <br> For instance, does the meaning of one text entail all or part of the other, as <br> in the following example? <br> <br> I bought a science fiction novel <br> I bought a book <br> <br> Or are the two texts so close in meaning that they can be considered <br> paraphrases, linked by many bidirectional entailments? <br> <br> On its way to an extended mission at Saturn, the Cassini probe on Friday <br> makes its closest rendezvous with Saturn's dark moon Phoebe. <br> The Cassini spacecraft, which is en route to Saturn, is about to make a <br> close pass of the ringed planet's mysterious moon Phoebe <br> <br> Quantifying semantic overlap is a fundamental challenge that encompasses issues <br> of lexical choice, syntactic alternation, and reference/discourse structure. The <br> last few years have seen a surge in interest in modeling techniques aimed at <br> measuring semantic equivalence and entailment, with work on paraphrase <br> acquisition/generation, WordNet-based expansion, distributional similarity, <br> supervised learning of semantic variability in information extraction, and the <br> identification of patterns in template-based QA. While different applications <br> face similar underlying semantic problems, these problems are typically <br> addressed in an application-specific manner. In the absence of a generic <br> evaluation framework, it is difficult to compare semantic methods that were <br> developed for different applications. One key goal of this workshop will be to <br> stimulate discussion around the issue of developing common datasets and <br> evaluation strategies <br> <br> More generally, our aim is to bring together people working on empirical, <br> application-independent approaches to the practical problems of semantic <br> inference. We welcome papers describing original work on computational <br> approaches to modeling the problems of semantic equivalence and entailment, and <br> encourage submissions on the following (non-exclusive) topics: <br> <br> -- Probabilistic modeling of meaning equivalence/entailment between arbitrary <br> text segments <br> -- Methods for generating textual entailments/paraphrases from novel inputs <br> -- String-based vs. linguistically-informed approaches to measuring meaning overlap <br> -- Developing training/test corpora: novel sources of data and strategies for <br> automating data collection <br> -- Human inter-annotator agreement on annotation tasks: Can humans reliably tag <br> the kinds of inferences that are needed for real applications? What information <br> can humans reliably tag? <br> -- Automated evaluation metrics for meaning equivalence/paraphrase <br> -- Empirical investigations into the types of entailment/equivalence inferences <br> needed for particular applications <br> -- Methods for determining which of many entailments between two text segments <br> are relevant for specific applications <br> -- Modeling lexical-level entailment relationships which are geared to be part <br> of entailment modeling for larger texts (as opposed to more general measures of <br> similarity) <br> -- Specific applications that exploit general measures of semantic overlap <br> -- Extension of MT techniques to problems of monolingual semantic <br> equivalence/entailment relationships <br> <br> The workshop will be anchored by two panel discussions, the first exploring how <br> the problem of semantic overlap has been successfully handled in several <br> applications (question answer, information retrieval, etc.) and the second aimed <br> at developing a shared evaluation task focused on this problem. <br> <br> IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES <br> <br> Paper submission deadline: April 20, 2005 <br> Camera ready copy: May 20, 2005 <br> Workshop date: June 30, 2005 <br> <br> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <br> <br> Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 6 pages, formatted <br> following the ACL 2005 guidelines.. <br> Both submission and review processes will be handled electronically. <br> <br> CORPORA RELEASE <br> <br> Two datasets are being released in conjunction with this workshop, in order to <br> stimulate submissions and thinking around this topic. While we hope that these <br> will be useful for training, evaluation, and analysis, authors are invited to <br> use whatever resources/approaches are at their disposal. <br> <br> -- The Pascal Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge Corpus: 1K sentence pairs <br> that have been human-annotated with directional entailments <br> (<A HREF="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/">http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/</A>) <br> -- The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus: 5801 likely sentential paraphrase <br> pairs gathered automatically from topically clustered news articles. Multiple <br> human raters examined each pair, classifying more than 3900 as close enough in <br> meaning to be considered equivalent <br> (<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/">http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/</A>).
