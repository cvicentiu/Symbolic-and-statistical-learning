He seemed to move all over Eastern Shore&mdash;Stillpond, Middelton, Salisbury, Chestertown Easton, etc managing A&amp;P Stores, selling grain &amp; feed, insurance and so forth.<BR><BR>On 31 August 2001, Robert Darian Moore Jr. wrote to Thomas Darian Moore:<BR>I ... wanted you to know this about my father. When he first came to the Eastern Shore, he settled in Still Pond, where I was born. He operated a grocery store there until he was hired by the A&amp;P Tea Company to manage their store in Centerville. Later he was transferred to Chestertown, where I went through school. He still lived in Chestertown in 1935 when I joined the Navy. After my mother died in Chestertown, and the A&amp;P let him go with no pension, I think he moved to Easton and Howard Moffett helped him to get on with AAA Automobile insurance. He later went to Salisbury where operated a AAA agency and he was there when he died as far as I know.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="15%"><B>1</B></TD><TD WIDTH="85%"><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/ps01/ps01_140.html"><B>Jessie Baynard Bockmiller</B></A>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/wp01/wp01_140.html"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="i_photo.gif"></A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Birth</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">9 Jun 1888, Maryland</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Death</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">9 Feb 1945</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Father</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">Bockmiller</TD></TR></TABLE></TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/wp01/wp01_140.html"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="pi01_140.jpg"></A></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Marriage</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">18 Oct 1910, Baltimore, Maryland</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Children</TD><TD WIDTH="85%"><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/ps01/ps01_142.html">Jessie Katherine</A> (1912-2002)</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%"></TD><TD WIDTH="85%">(Private) </TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%"></TD><TD WIDTH="85%"><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/ps01/ps01_143.html">Margaret Anne</A> (1923-1985)</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="15%"><B>2</B></TD><TD WIDTH="85%"><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/ps17/ps17_424.html"><B>Anna Louise</B></A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Birth</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">abt 1895</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="15%">Marriage</TD><TD WIDTH="85%">9 Oct 1946, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ignore=on --><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD>Last Modified 23 Nov 2005</TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>Created 22 Dec 2006 by Reunion for Macintosh</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ignore=off --><HR><CENTER><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/index.html"><B>Contents</B></A> * <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/wc_idx/idx001.html"><B>Index</B></A> * <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/wc_idx/sur.html"><B>Surnames</B></A> * <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/index.html#CNTC"><B>Contact</B></A> * <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/thomas_moore/genealogy/wc01/wc01_059.html"><B>Web Family Card</B></A><BR>Copyright &copy;2006 Thomas Moore.
