					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">WOW! I am blown away! Despite the fact that I was sick in bed most of the day (from the flu), yesterday will truly stand out as one of the most memorable days of my life thanks to all of YOU!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Yesterday was my birthday, and most of you who know me, know I don’t like to make a big deal out of it. And so I was hoping that yesterday would pass without too much pomp and circumstance, only now to realize what a truly special and wonderful day the people from ALDC made it out to be.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">First I started getting balloon bouquets from Tammy Williams. Thank you Tammy! Then another one came from ALDC and then this GIANT FRUIT BASKET showed up from ALDC. I got so many cards and emails yesterday it will take me a week to thank everyone personally. Then Rob &amp; Lynda show up with dinner from PF Changs and very special homemade birthday cards from their children (very, very sweet), THEN Roderick Semaan shows up with a BIRTHDAY VIDEO CARD from ALDC!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">WOW! How can I ever say thank you for thinking enough of me to put all that together? It really touched my heart and my soul. There was a definite positive response in my body upon reflection of all that happened yesterday. I am truly blessed to have so many friends and so many wonderful thoughts sent my way. Lipo Love was definitely present and continues today!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">The video was absolutely awesome! I am just awestruck! There is no other way to put it. You all really touched my life yesterday in a truly special way. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart! I will never forget yesterday and just please know that Donna and I will relish these moments for the rest of our lives.<span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Then Chuck Hill and his wife Robin show up with gifts and homemade cookies. I’m thinking about backing you Robin in a bakery business. Those cookies are absolutely awesome! They are the best homemade chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. You are a sweet and wonderful person. Thank you so much for all you've done and continue to do to support the flight department and every life you come in contact with.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Chuck, Happy Birthday as today is your special day. You, Robin and Arlon have made so many special concessions for me and once again, I wanted to say thank you. The framed picture of the flight to Bonaire was really special. Thank you so much. I hope you have a great birthday today and I will see you soon.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Woz, got your card and gift. Thanks so much. Jessie! Got your card and Steak n Shake Gift Card. That was really kind and thoughtful. Thank you so much. I miss you! To all the others that sent cards and emails, I will thank you personally. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">WOW! You will probably never know just how much this all meant to me. I had to post this morning and let you all know how deeply moved and thankful I am to have you as my friends. It was truly a landmark day and I will forever count myself more blessed than most because of it. I love you, I will pray for you and yours as you continue to do for me and my family.</span></p>

				<div class="entry-body">
					<p><strong>When Hernando Cortez landed his ships in Mexico in 1519, he may have been concerned about a mutiny, or determined to explore the land before him, or he might have been thinking he would never have to return to the ocean. Whatever he was thinking, he ordered his men to burn the ships. Cortez was totally committed and allowed himself no option of turning back.</strong></p>

<p><strong>------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>

<p>I'm sorry I haven't posted in a while. The last month or so has been a bit hectic. I have tried to come to grips with my cancer and the potential of treatments that lie before me. The truth is, no one can really tell me what is going to work and what isn't. I have made two different trips to New York to Memorial Sloan Kettering, the world's largest and oldest cancer treatment center. After this last trip, what was proposed was a radical surgery that involved removing part of my liver, my gall bladder, my primary cancer site in my colon along with the lymph nodes and implanting a hepatic arterial infusion pump that would deliver 400 times more powerful chemotherapy directly into my liver than I have been given to date.</p>

<p>After long and thoughtful deliberation, prayer and conversations with my family, I have decided to stop all conventional medical treatment and begin a new chapter which will involve only holistic and alternative therapies.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly which course I will eventually take, but I have looked into juice fasting, hyperbaric oxygen treatments and other herbal remedies that seem to have real and permanent results with many other people. These others are sometimes given less than three weeks to live and &quot;miraculously&quot; their cancer goes into remission and they have lived long and healthy lives.</p>

<p>I don't know how to explain how I've come to this conclusion about my treatment, only that I feel better about this decision than any other decision I've made in the past. It just seems so anathema to me that what conventional medicine proposes to &quot;help&quot; me, has in fact hurt me more than I can explain. I'm going to try and give my body, mind and spirit the necessary tools to help cure me of this cancer that will enable a long and healthy life.</p>

<p>I suppose the lapse in my posting had a lot to do with my own confusion about which way to turn. As you have read, I last landed in Houston hoping that the anti-neoplastin drug developed by Dr Burzynski would help me as it appears to have helped so many others. But after my last scan and two more hospital stays, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that it was not working as I had hoped.</p>

<p>However, the overwhelming support that I have received from all of you has been so encouraging and uplifting in the most difficult of times. God has expressed his love to me in so many ways, through you, my wife, my partner, my son, my parents, my wife's family and so many friends that I count myself extremely blessed to be held in such regard by so many. Your continuing prayers, thoughts, cards and telephone calls are appreciated more than words can say, but I will say thank you, I love you all, and I am still a Survivor!</p>

<p>So like Cortez, I have decided to make a full commitment to a new path. A path that I believe will lead me to complete recovery and a full restoration of my health. Please continue to pray for me and my family as we take on this challenge with a renewed strength and vigor. I believe that God will lift me up to be a testament of his Will and his Miraculous Love...</p>

<p>And you are all a part of that Miracle! </p>

<p>--Robert</p>

							<h3 class="entry-header">Back in St Louis!</h3>
			
			<div class="entry-content">
				<div class="entry-body">
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Well, we’re back from Houston finally! After seeing Dr Burzynski yesterday in Houston for the second time he discharged me from the clinic and sent me back home to continue my treatments for the next 2 ½ months. I will return in early December after having had a second full body PET scan here in St Louis around Thanksgiving time. Follow up appointments at the clinic should only take a day, so perhaps the worst of it is behind me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">In the meantime, I will continue taking my oral treatments and have blood work drawn every two weeks and will remain in contact with the clinic to stay on top of my progress. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">The last two weeks have been fairly good though. After receiving IV infusions of Amino Acids and Proteins for 7 days, my immune system began to rebound and today I feel pretty well. I have a lot more energy than I did have on chemo and have finally come out of the “fog”. In truth, I remember more of the last two weeks than I do of the last four months. And for that, I am truly thankful. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I did spike a fever last Monday evening that went as high as 103 degrees, but after running blood work at the clinic several times, Dr Burzynski concluded that my fever was medication related and was in all likelihood a direct result of the tumors breaking down. He based this assumption on the fact that all my blood counts were perfectly normal with the exception of the Uric acid count which he attributed directly to tumor deterioration. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And so after nearly 4 months, I am returning to work today at least part time to help Rob with ALDC. I’ll have to take it day by day for now, as I don’t want to over exert myself. But as long as I’m feeling up to it, I hope to be present at ALDC on a daily basis from this point forward. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I attribute my continued recovery so far first to God and his amazing grace. And secondly to all those who have supported and prayed and comforted me and Donna over the last several months. Your strength and support have consistently helped to hold us up during the roughest times and I praise God that he has lead you to do so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">My number one source of strength has of course come from God and additionally made manifest through my wife Donna who has been a consistent and patient caregiver. Her strength through all this has been amazing and incredible. In addition, my nurse, Jessica Weis has also been extremely helpful and supportive. Despite the fact she is getting married in less than a month, she has traveled with Donna and me over the last several weeks and has consistently applied her knowledge and training to better my care and understand my treatment. In addition, she has shown a remarkable capacity for handling details and making things happen. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">As you might recall from a previous post, I credit her abilities in this regard in helping me to get into the Burzynski clinic on such short notice in the first place. As a result of all that I’ve learned about her and her abilities, I’ve asked Jessica to become my Administrative Assistant at ALDC effective immediately. So please join me in welcoming Jessica to the ALDC family! And I want to tell you personally Jessi, how thankful I am that God put you in our lives. You’ve been a great nurse and a wonderful friend! I look forward to our continued relationship with great enthusiasm. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I understand the R&amp;R Bounty has been quite popular with the employees at ALDC and of course I knew it would be as you all have come to know and love Paula as we do. Paula is a remarkable woman who’s only attributes consist of warmth, compassion and love (In my humble and modest opinion). And her ability to transform a cold septic environment into what is now the R&amp;R Bounty is nothing short of incredible. Thank you so much Paula, I am looking forward to my first meal there today with unbridled enthusiasm and expectation. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Tahoma; mso-hansi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings">J</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And of course there are so many others that have contributed including Todd, Dan, Tank, Andrew and others. I thank you all very much for everything you’ve done and continue to do in this regard. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I will likely not update this blog as frequently unless there is some type of update on my progress. But you can be sure that once I have news, I will let you know as quickly as possible. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Until then, may God bless you all for your continued prayers, love and support. As I stated in my first post, everyone one of you has helped reinforce God’s peace in my life and helped sustain the belief and reality that I am a Survivor! Thank you.</span></p>

							<h3 class="entry-header">2nd Week in Houston</h3>
			
			<div class="entry-content">
				<div class="entry-body">
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Sorry for not posting for a while, but it’s been a little busy here in Houston, along with the aggravation we had to go through to get internet access in our room. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I arrived in Houston on the evening of September 7 and began treatment at the Burzynski Institute on Friday September 8. I have had to go to the clinic every day with the exception of this weekend to receive a 4 hour infusion of Vitamins and Amino Acids to rebuild my immune system, along with the daily regimen of anti-neoplastons and other meds. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I’m actually feeling pretty much back to normal now, with the exception of some minor flu-like symptoms and some general fatigue and weakness. The dexterity in my fingers is coming back somewhat although at times, it feels very frustrating when I can’t do the smallest of tasks like open a bottle or button my shirt. This I believe is just left over from the chemo I was doing and should improve over time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I had a PET scan done last week which definitively showed where the active cancer was in my body. There really has been nothing but good news in this regard, I think I was just wishing it had been a bit better. But overall, the news is good. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">The PET scan showed the cancer in my colon is dormant or dead. There is no active cancer in the colon which is the primary site. It also showed that there was no other metastasis to any other parts of my body including the lymph system except the liver. The radiologist was able to count the number of lesions in my liver and it is now 20. But there has been no change in the size of the lesions from the middle of July, which leads the doctors down here to believe that I stopped responding to the chemo treatments after the 3<sup>rd</sup> treatment. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">They have also done 3 blood draws since I’ve been here and my blood counts have continually been improving to the point they are all within normal range. In fact, my liver enzymes are perfectly normal as well. The only abnormality in my blood was the uric acid count which has been continuing to rise since my arrival. The doctors here see that as a very positive sign that the tumors are deteriorating and breaking down. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I am on a much milder oral form of chemo now in addition to the anti-neoplastons which is called Xeloda. The doctors have also started me on another drug called Tarceva. And they will probably supplement this with another drug tomorrow, called Sutendt. All of these drugs are basically non-toxic and complement one another in my fight against this cancer. The Xeloda is actually a pill form of the chemo 5FU that I was doing on my fanny pack for two days following each chemo infusion. I believe it is responsible for the flu-like symptoms as they are similar to what I experienced during heavy chemo treatment, only they were much more debilitating then. These symptoms are far more tolerable than before.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">So like I said, the news is good and I am optimistic that the news will improve as my treatments continue. I plan to leave here Thursday afternoon and return to St Louiswhere I will continue my daily treatments. Then in 4-6 weeks, I will have another CT scan done in St Louisand we’ll see how things are progressing. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Some things have been happening at ALDC this past week that have dampened my spirits though. I am disheartened to hear about some terminations and problems related to the company. I have also been told there is a rumor that these terminations are due to some cash flow problems at the company. I can assure you THEY ARE NOT! My mother used to tell me, believe NONE of what you hear and only half of what you see. If you are an ALDC employee then I implore you to help quash this rumor as it has no foundation in substance or fact. The only thing we appear to be lacking at ALDC is a unified front in pushing the company forward. Something I hope to help change as soon as I get back. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I appreciate the emails and phone calls. Donna and I are very fortunate and blessed to have so many friends and supporters during this difficult time. I thank God every day for putting each one of you in my life and helping to carve this new path we are traveling. I can’t wait to get back and see everyone and begin a new chapter in my life that will reflect God’s intentions for how I move forward. I get very excited when I think about the prospects for what could be in store. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Until then, we will continue to keep you all in our prayers and thoughts as well. See ya soon!</span></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I know it’s been quite a while since I’ve posted, but I’ve been so toxified by the chemo that I’ve lost my dexterity which impedes my ability to type or even to put coherent thoughts together. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">BUT… there have been lots of things going on and I know everyone is interested in knowing so I am going to try to be as coherent as possible and explain the latest and greatest.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Since my last treatment, which was the 5<sup>th</sup>, things started getting worse for me. I continued to have lower GI problems among the chemo fog, lapse of memory, loss of dexterity in my fingers just to name a few. It was becoming increasingly difficult to even walk from the bedroom to the bathroom. Donna, Dennis and Paula have all witnessed the worst of what the chemo was doing to me and were becoming increasingly concerned about my ability to even continue the chemo treatments, especially now that the oncologists were calling for 7 more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I also was becoming increasingly concerned. Stomach cramps were crippling me and I began to wonder whether I could even survive the chemo. I literally told Donna that I was much more afraid of the chemo treatments than I was the cancer itself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I have been receiving phone calls from others who were encouraging me to pursue alternative, less toxic remedies and as time went on since the last treatment, I began to give this serious thought. One of the recommendations came from Bonnie Lemunyon who suggested that I contact Dr Sam Walters, a naturopath doctor in Scottsdale who specializes in treating Stage IV cancer patients. I had spoken with Dr Walters a few weeks ago and decided to make contact again. Through Jessie’s help, we were able to get an appointment with Dr Walters so we all flew to Scottsdale to meet with him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">By the time I got to Scottsdale I was in a lot of pain. And by the time we got to Dr Walters office and met with him, I was even worse. After a brief examination, he contacted a friend of his, an oncologist at Scottsdale Memorial and they both agreed that I needed to be admitted to the hospital. So I spent the next two days in the hospital. At one point I was on a morphine drip for the pain, but was reacting so badly after 12 hours, they had to remove it and come up with some different pain medications which did work. Dr Walters told me about this famous oncologist at Scottsdale Memorial that would be meeting with me and told me, if he can’t fix you, nobody can.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Well, I never met with the famous oncologist, but I did meet with his partner, Dr Brorad. After all the examinations and evaluations of current CT scans and treatment protocols, and after two personal interviews with me, he concluded that everything that could be done for me, was already being done in St Louis. This of course speaks very highly for my oncologist team in St Louis, but still offered me nothing new in terms of reducing the side effects of the chemo. </span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">At one point, they were going to do multiple tests on me including a colonoscopy to determine where the blood was coming from. I had started bleeding in my stool, sometimes profusely which was very scary by itself. But in the end (no pun intended) they decided that the chemo had severely weakened my intestinal wall and a colonoscopy could result in an intestinal puncture which would then require immediate surgery, so they cancelled that test.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I was discharged after two days in the hospital at my request. They wanted me to stay longer, but I’d had enough and just wanted to go home. So they reluctantly agreed, largely because of Jessie being with me as my nurse to release me in her custody, so to speak. They wrote a few more scripts for pain, some antibiotics and who knows what else. I have been taking a lot of medication and have begun to lose track of all the scripts I’m now on. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Anyway, after I was discharged, Donna and I seriously began to think that chemo was no longer an option for me. It was clearly taking me down physically and the potential harm to other internal organs was becoming a long term concern as well. So we started looking at different options for alternative treatments including Santa Monica Hospital, Oasis of Hope and the Burzynski Institute in Houston.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I won’t go into all the details but after we flew back to St Louis, I met with my oncologist and told her that I was no longer going to continue chemo but instead pursue some alternative treatments. Dr Suresh of course told me this was a bad decision but would monitor my progress if I pursued this option. In short, she scared me quite a bit and I returned home feeling a sense of desperation and helplessness. I prayed that God would help show me the way because I was truly lost and confused as to which way to turn. I knew in my heart that I could not continue the chemo but I also felt I had no other option.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And then another profound miracle happened. Even though I was set to go to Santa Monica hospital next Monday and go through their detox and hyperbaric oxygen treatments, I got a call from Tanya Harter Pierce who suggested that we look more closely at the Burzynski Institute. Apparently, they do molecular gene therapy that targets the cancer cells with no side effects; in fact the treatment is completely non toxic. But she warned me that most patients that apply are turned down for treatment because of heavy FDA regulations.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Jessie got on the phone and despite a lot of pushback, she was able to pull together all of my medical records, get them faxed to the Burzynski Institute and within hours, they agreed to see me the very next morning, which was yesterday. This was a miracle in and of itself since their average lead time is three or more weeks to get a consultation. And as we found out after meeting with them, a lot of cancer patients that apply to the Institute are never invited for a consultation so the fact that we were there was a sign that the doctors felt they could help me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">After several interviews and reviews of my medical records along with a consultation with Dr Burzynski over the telephone since he was in Swedenat the time, they accepted me as a patient and I begin treatment tomorrow morning. I wept with joy when they informed me they would accept me as did Donna. Another miracle and a definitive demonstration of <br />God’s handiwork in my life had just occurred. </span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">It was clear from the moment we walked into the institute, this is where I needed to be. Dr Burzynski’s treatment is based on DNA cellular manipulation. I don’t understand it technically, but in laymen’s terms they manufacture little pac mans to kill the cancer cells and not harm the healthy cells. It is completely non toxic, has a high degree of success of complete and total recovery, and is in fact based in medical science that has been around for more than 25 years. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">So why haven’t you heard about this? That is a question I can’t even begin to answer, but if you really want to know (and you may not want to) then Google his name and read about his history. Apparently for years, the FDA at the behest of the pharmaceutical companies have tried not once, not twice, but three times to quash Dr Burzynski and his treatment protocols, to protect their profits. They tried unsuccessfully to criminally prosecute him and throw him in jail for saving lives. Only now has the FDA after protests at the White house and through Congress agreed to fast track his cancer treatment for public consumption. It may be two to three years before this treatment is generally available to the public and incorporated into mainstream medicine, which is a shame in and of itself, but at least it is finally on track to do so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Check out his web site at <a href="http://www.cancermed.com/"><span style="color: #800080;">www.cancermed.com</span></a> for more information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">So today I fly back to Houston with Donna and begin my treatment tomorrow morning. I will be there for two weeks then return home. My oral medications will be self administered from that point on and I will only have to return every two months for examination and follow up until I am in complete remission. Their goal by the way is to treat me for full recovery and in such a way that surgery will not be required. </span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I am amazed and awestruck by how this all came together. Another true miracle and a demonstration of God’s grace and handiwork. Your prayers and mine have been answered and I know you rejoice in this news as Donna and I do. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Thank you for your prayers, your cards, your emails, your support, encouragement and tears. They have apparently born fruit and I praise God for his mercy and his grace demonstrated directly and indirectly in more ways than I could ever count. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I will update from Houston as the treatments progress. But I am officially off chemo and am told by the doctors in Houston, I will be feeling back to my normal self within the next two weeks. </span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I know that scares most of you… </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"> so I will pray that God gives you the strength to tolerate me once I am back to normal again. <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Tahoma; mso-hansi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings">J</span></span></span></p>

							<h3 class="entry-header">Day 2 of 5th Chemo</h3>
			
			<div class="entry-content">
				<div class="entry-body">
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Today’s Status: C5 D2 I2</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Yesterday I received my 5<sup>th</sup> chemo treatment at the Siteman Cancer Center. After spending some time asking more pointed questions of my Doctor, Rama Suresh, I was given some stronger indications about what I can expect relative to the number of chemo treatments. And by stronger I mean, it hit home harder than it has before that my previous expectations have been set by a combination of wishful thinking and filtered information coming from my medical team.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I understand they (the medical team) have a hard job. They must temper their answers with hope, but not false hope and are likely to give me information on what could be best described as a “need to know” basis. I actually used the analogy yesterday of likening my medical team to an insurance agent. When they are trying to get you to sign up they tell you about all the protection and benefits you will have as a result of becoming a customer. But when you try to file a claim, you might be a bit surprised about some of the discrepancies between your expectations and actual reality. Not that they lie to you so much, they just tend to soften some of the more detailed information up front so that you really don’t pay much attention to the fine print and hope you never need to.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Anyway, the medical team has now reset my expectations from 6 chemo treatments to 12! OUCH! Dr. Suresh was more emphatic about this possibility than she has been in the past, although this is not the first time I’ve heard this information, it’s just the first time it’s been driven home so emphatically. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Apparently, all the studies which went into the protocol for my particular treatment are based on 12 chemo treatments not 6. And although everything I’ve reported in the past is still true, relative to tumor disappearance and shrinkage and lower CEA counts, and the doctor’s astonishment at this result, it may not play all that big of a role when I get my CT scan after the 6<sup>th</sup> treatment. And the reason is so… If the CT scan shows any tumors or scar tissue that cannot be readily differentiated from tumor, then the surgeons (not Dr Suresh) will likely call for an additional 6 treatments since that is the protocol for this treatment regimen. In other words, unless everything has completely disappeared or can be accounted for as scar tissue, the surgeons will err on the side of caution and insist that I finish the protocol, regardless of the eventual outcome, meaning even if an additional 6 treatments yield no new results. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">This “new” information was received with some dread yesterday as you might imagine. This means my chemo treatments may continue throughout the end of the year with surgery being postponed until February next year. I could be an exception to the rule and they may discover that they can operate after 6, but holding out false hope for this result would obviously be gravely disappointing if it did not happen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I couldn’t sleep much last night, got up around 2:30 this morning and have been unable to get back to sleep. I went to bed with some anxiety about this news, but I woke up feeling at peace and knowing that everything was in God’s hands anyway, and my worrying about a particular outcome is lost energy that could be better spent elsewhere. So even though I didn’t sleep much, my prayers for strength and grace to accept these things for whatever they might turn out to be, were answered overnight as I now feel a renewed sense of spiritual peace and strength that will continue to guide me through this treatment. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Please continue to pray for all of us as this news just does not affect me. Donna, Brian, Stephanie, Paula, Dennis, my mom and dad and of course my best friend and partner Rob as well as many others that are affected by this news and would be affected by continuing treatments at a variety of levels. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">As always, I appreciate the continuing emails, card, thoughts and prayers. There are many positive things happening that in spite of this latest revelation, continue to give many of us hope that we are heading in the right direction and that ultimately we will claim victory over this cancer and give God the credit for all he has done and all the people he worked through to orchestrate his grand plan in this regard.</span></p>

							<h3 class="entry-header">2 Days Until Treatment #5</h3>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Today’s Status: C4 D13 I1</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Well, I can honestly say I’ve had better weeks than this last one. This week has harbored some of the more difficult days for me physically than in the past. Tuesday was probably the worst day for me, but then Thursday morning I woke up and felt pretty good. I invited my cousin Jeff from Northern Michigan to come down for the weekend and he did. But then Friday and Saturday were much harder on me than I expected. This morning, for whatever reason, I’m feeling reasonably well and hope that I can maintain now until Tuesday when treatment #5 begins. Hopefully just two more and then I can go to surgery and begin my full recovery.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Woz, Eddie, Amy and Jen Lowther came over yesterday afternoon and brought pizza! Thanks guys! It was great seeing you all again especially Woz and Eddie who flew in for the weekend to see some old friends from the 321 gang. They combed the blog site and found out what kind of pizza I liked and brought it over from Fortel’s. It was great! Thanks again!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And of course the emails, cards and letters continue to come in on a regular basis. Donna and I really appreciate it and are strengthened by your support and love. Even though this is a very difficult time for the Moore household, it will always be remembered as a very special time when our family and friends rallied to support us through prayer and love. I can’t imagine going through something like this without that encouragement, yet I know many people do. I consider myself one of the luckiest people on the planet to have such loyal, loving and supportive family and friends. It’s difficult to rationalize in my mind that I have ever done anything to deserve such affection and support. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I received a very sweet email from Bonnie Lemunyon regarding the post yesterday. Thank you Bonnie. You’re such a sweet and tender hearted woman. I’ve known you a long time and the attributes that stand out in my mind about you are how much you have always been sweet and tender hearted. You’ve already tried so many ways to help including alerting us to the Mangosteen juice that I take every day as part of my home therapy. So the email came as no surprise. Thank you! Donna and I love you too.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">My cousin Jeff has been here since Thursday afternoon and will likely head back on Monday. It’s been a pleasure having him here and seeing him again. It had been a year and a half since we last saw one another, so it’s been great catching up and I know he’s happy that he was able to make the trip and come down and see me before my surgery. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Thanks again for all the continued prayers, love and support. We treasure them and always will. </span></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Today’s Status: C4 D12 I2</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">“So, what’s the big deal about some hole in the ground?” Brian asked sarcastically of his mother and me. “I mean, why do I have to go anyway?” Donna and I looked at one another and cracked a smile. We knew what Brian was in store for, but since he’d never seen the Grand Canyon, he couldn’t equate his giving up a weekend of Nintendo and basketball for a weekend with his parents to go see some “hole” in the ground. Brian was only 12 years old but had already mastered the art of making his parents feel really guilty when they tried to do anything that wasn’t on his top 10 list. But we pressed on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Donna and I tried in vain to explain that it wasn’t just some hole in the ground. This was one of nature’s most awesome and breathtaking wonders. Vista views, magnificent horizons, colors, shading and just the awesome vastness of the Grand Canyon made it something that one just had to see to appreciate. We both searched for the words to describe this incredible landscape, but the words just seemed to get in the way. Brian, dissatisfied with any of our answers, sighed and sulked back into his seat in the car. He was our prisoner for the weekend and he knew nothing short of opening the door and rolling himself out of the car at 60 miles per hour was going to get him out of this one. I guess he decided it wasn’t worth the risk, or maybe I had the child safety locks on, I can’t remember.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">But Donna and I knew, or at least hoped that once Brian was able to take in this incredible scenery first hand, he would understand what we were trying so hard to describe. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">We only lived about 4 hours south of the Grand Canyon in Phoenix, Arizona at that time. So it wasn’t a long drive. By the time we arrived at the South Rim gate, there was still a few hours before sunset, so the afternoon sun was just beginning to make its way down the canyon from our first vantage point. Brian jumped out of the car and exclaimed his amazement at what he was seeing. Donna and I just looked at one another and smiled. It had taken less than 10 seconds for Brian to realize that all we had described to him had paled in comparison to the reality of seeing the Grand Canyon up close and personal. Brian was truly awestruck!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">That first hand experience could not be described, defined, translated or interpreted. It had to be personally experienced to take in the marvelous wonder and awesome beauty that could only be given by the canyon itself. I remember Brian sitting by my side at the canyon wall and thanking me for bringing him along despite his attempts to the contrary. I put my arm around him and told him I loved him and that I wanted to share this experience with him. Brian put his arm around me and said, “I love you too Dad! Thanks again!” And in the immortal words of some future president, I uttered those two simple words to myself, Mission Accomplished!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">There is no substitute for a personal experience. And like most things in life, we can’t entirely comprehend or grasp the beauty of something until we have personally experienced what it is like to be in its presence. I can understand how difficult it may be for some to grasp that God is real and that He can have real impact in their lives, because I was that person until April 21, 1998. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">But on that day, God revealed himself to me as very real and began to unveil his plan for me in a very personal way that continues to this day. I cannot describe it more definitively than I have in the past, I cannot reveal its marvelous and awesome wonder in a way that will make you understand what happened any more so than I already have. This is a miracle that you must see and feel for yourself in order to truly understand what I am talking about. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I praise and thank God every day for the blessings in my life. I thank him for keeping the safety locks on and not letting me roll myself out of the car of life prior to 1998. I thank him for letting me see the awesome spectacle of his will in my life and others that are around me. I thank him and love him for giving me the opportunity to witness first hand to you of the awesome and miraculous events that have transpired along the way. But in the end, no matter what I say or hard I try to describe it, I will fall far short of the up close and personal experience that I pray you find for yourself, if you haven’t already.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Up until yesterday, I thought I had experienced the worst effects of the chemo therapy. I was mistaken. The effects of the chemo fog continue to get worse with each treatment, but even as yesterday was my worst day so far, I started to rebound last night and am feeling a lot better this morning. Perhaps I will rebound more quickly from this point on. I hope so. It’s hard on me, but I know it’s really so much harder on Donna as she feels so helpless when I am going through these days. Please continue to pray for her as she battles her way through this as well.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">But as I said, I am feeling better this morning. I continue to receive so many emails and cards, I can’t thank everyone enough for their love, prayers and support. But I have to send a special thank you go Grandma who sends me one card every day, (like I said I should have bought stock in Hallmark) and to Grandpa who sent me a card this week. I love you both very much! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Our good friends Jeff and Jennifer lost their grandfather to cancer this past week. He was diagnosed just a few weeks ago and passed quickly. I know that Jeff and Jenn are thankful he did not suffer long and Donna and I wanted to say how sorry we are we can’t be with you at the wake today, but our hearts are with you and your whole family. We hope to see you guys soon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Also, thanks to Kristin Hall and Tammie Cooper, I have a private nurse that is working with my doctor to hopefully help prevent any future trips to the hospital between now and surgery, and is also able to administer several medications and fluids here at home to help prevent the same thing. Her name is Jessica Weis and she visits me daily to take vitals and check up on things. If my condition were to worsen, she is available around the clock to work with my doctors and BJC Home Health Care under almost any condition. This has definitely helped relieve some anxiety with respect to fears of having to go back to the hospital. So a big thanks to Kristin and Tammie and Jessie!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Please keep Donna, Dennis, Paula, my mom and dad, my sister, Brian and the rest of our family in your prayers as well. I truly believe this is harder on family members than it is on the one going through it, because of the helplessness they must feel at times. Also, please keep Rob in your prayers as he battles the daily business without the aid of his trusted and wiser business partner! </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Tahoma; mso-hansi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings">J</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"> Rob, I miss you brother, I know you miss me too. </span></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Today's Status: C4 D3 I3</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">One of my earliest childhood memories is very strange, yet very memorable. My grandfather on my mother’s side (actually, I am his namesake, who was also named Robert) took me camping one night when I was around 4 or 5. I remember sleeping under the stars. And I’m pretty sure my father the Baptist Preacher was nowhere around, because my grandfather offered me my first taste of beer that night, and I liked it! However, I’m pretty sure my father found out about it and must have had a pretty stern talk with my grandfather, because he never did it again. Maybe he never had a chance because he died in a car accident just a few years later. He was with my Grandmother who were both thrown from the car, she survived, he didn’t as the car landed on top of him and killed him. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I had a pretty hard childhood. And before you think this is some soliloquy about how hard my parents made it on me, it is not. My parents made their mistakes, just like I did, just like every parent does. But the one indelible impression they made on me, despite their shortcomings, was that they loved me. My father used his meager salary to provide a good home, clothing, food and an emotional and spiritual environment that fostered an honest upbringing. My mother supported my father 100% and to be honest, we three kids never got away with too much. We still argue to this day about who got it the worst, I think I did, and my sisters were let to slide a bit more than me, but that’s water under the bridge and good conversation around the Thanksgiving table.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">But the reason I had a hard childhood had more to do with me than anything else. I was a stubborn, Type A personality, mostly a loner, smallest in my class, had a big mouth and not much to back it up with. Not to brag, but I was also pretty smart, showed an above average aptitude in my class, but became very bored in class and let my mind wander to other things rather than concentrate on my studies. So in short, I didn’t get along all too well with classmates, had very few friends and pretty much deserved it that way because of my introverted personality, which occasionally came off as a holier than thou attitude… and that didn’t always play well with the bigger boys in school. I got in a lot of fights and usually came out the loser.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">By the time I was 16, I was regularly skipping high school and started hanging out with a crowd that we shall call less than perfect. We would go to different houses, where beer and other alcoholic beverages were readily available and we would drink. I remember my first overindulgence where after a morning of drinking, I spent most of the afternoon throwing up and trying to get sober before having to return home after pretending to be at school all day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">By the time I was 17, I was ready to drop out of school. Despite my father’s best intentions to talk me out of this move, he finally conceded and granted the requisite authorization to let me drop out, which I did, under the condition I would pursue a GED and pass. I did within 1 month of dropping out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Then I was ready to join the Marine Corps. My cousin Phillip was in the Marine Corps and I remembered how impressed I was with him after seeing him return home from boot camp. And I wanted to leave home in the worst way, so again, against my father’s best intentions, he reluctantly agreed to sign the papers to allow my voluntary enlistment and on Dec 26<sup>th</sup>, 1977, the day after Christmas, I took off for San Diego Marine Corps Boot Camp. But before I left, I was tested downtown to determine my aptitude and what my MOS (military occupational specialty) would be. I scored so high on their aptitude tests, that they gave me my choice of MOS. What would you like to do Robert, they asked. I told them I wanted to be a pilot and fly jet aircraft. To which they replied that was the one thing I could not do. I had to be an officer to fly a jet fighter and in order to be an officer I had to be a college graduate. SO, next best thing was Air Control Electronics Operator. Apparently a step above Air Traffic Controller, and I was going to be working with jet fighters, so I agreed and off to boot camp I went.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I think it was about 1 week into boot camp that I called home crying and sobbing to my father to get me out of this hell hole. I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. First they shaved my head, called me every low life name in the book, gave me very little sleep and generally just screamed all the time at everyone. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Long story short, my dad didn’t bail me out, I stayed for the entire 16 weeks of boot camp and graduated, one of the proudest days of my life. My parents couldn’t make it out to California, but my cousin Philip who wasn’t stationed too far away at Camp Pendleton, came to my graduation and took me to the airport so that I could visit my family in St Louis on a 10 day leave, before reporting to 29 Palms for training as an Air Control Electronics Operator. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">My mother claims she didn’t recognize me when I came to the door. I had put on quite a bit of weight, all muscle, and when they sat me down to talk in the living room, they were amazed by how little I talked and only spoke when spoken too. I think my dad still refers to this time as the Golden Years, though they might have lasted a bit less than years. But they were quite amazed that I was so reserved and so responsive to authority. Boot camp was good for me in many ways, but what was to follow was only to begin to unveil God’s plan for my life.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">After my 10 day leave in St Louis, I was transferred to 29 Palms. Although drinking was discouraged during boot camp, it was exactly the opposite by the time I reached 29 Palms. Drinking was not only condoned, it was encouraged. There was always plenty of booze in the barracks and even though I wasn’t of legal drinking age, I was able to go to the Enlisted Bar on base and drink to my hearts content. And if that wasn’t enough, all the drinking establishments off base were more than happy to serve anything you wanted without carding for the proper age for drinking. In short I learned three things in the Marine corps, I learned to run, I learned to drink and I learned I didn’t like to run. I remember staying up all night drinking with buddies until 5 am, taking No-Doz and reporting to work by 7am. It was a weird time. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Despite my many overindulgences, I was able to make it through my school and believe it or not, graduated at the top of my class. I was given my choice of duty, Hawaii, Germany, Cuba, El Toro or Cherry Point, North Carolina. Since I wanted to be close to St Louis as possible, I chose Cherry Point North Carolina. So after another brief leave back home, I reported to Cherry Point, NC. Since this is already a long post, I will try to skip through some of the more sordid details and tell you that in 1979, I was honorably discharged and returned home. But by this time, I had developed an insatiable appetite for drinking and partying.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">When I returned home, my new patterns of behavior were incompatible with my parents expectations, and I soon sought refuge in the company of others, staying away from my parents as much as possible. I soon met my wife Donna and after a short courtship, asked her to marry me, and on January 25, 1980, my father married us in her parents home. Brian, our son was born 8 months later on September 14, 1980. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I really didn’t know how I was going to support Donna and Brian. I took odd sales jobs, selling cars, selling insurance, and at one point moved to Nashville, Tennesseeto pursue a dream of being a songwriter and singer. I did get signed as a songwriter and actually published one song that I co-wrote with another songwriter that was recorded by Razzy Bailey on his one and only album. The Grammy eluded me and after 9 months we were forced to move back with Donna’s parents just before Brian’s 1<sup>st</sup> birthday. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">But during all this time, my drinking became worse, more insatiable and was starting to take its toll on all my relationships most especially with my in-laws who were growing tired of supporting what appeared to be a loser husband for their very young daughter. Those were some tough years. My invasion of my in-laws home contributed to many emotional upsets in their home, especially with her dad, Darrell, and eventually contributed to the divorce between Donna’s mom and dad. In fact, those times contributed to an almost 25 year long silence of communication between myself, Donna’s dad and Donna and her dad. Meaning they never spoke much after 1984. It also highly affected Laurie and Cherie, Donna’s sisters. Something I deeply regret and actually had the chance to speak to Darrell and begin the reparation process with him 6 days before my cancer diagnosis. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Eventually, I started to grow up at least financially and started taking responsibility for my family. I continued to drink and party, but managed to hold jobs for a while. I eventually went to programming school and then dropped out with my Logical Concepts Professor and founded my first company, Data Programming Consultants. The two of us developed video rental software and sold it to VHS and BETA rental stores. We did pretty well and it appeared that I found my nitch.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Unfortunately, as things would start to go well for me in any particular direction, my drinking would always rear its ugly head in some way and I would cut off my nose to spite my face. I would argue incoherently with partners, customers and family in a manner that would alienate them completely from my life. And then when everyone disappeared, I would just start over again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">You see, I’ve always had this God given talent to rally people to a cause, persuade them to join me in some new business venture. I’ve had this ability to be a natural born leader for some time and it was being refined, but as many steps as I would take forward, I would often take more than twice that backwards by indulging in my favorite pastime, drinking.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Friends would try to talk to me, even as early as in the Marine Corps, I remember senior staff trying to talk to me in earnest about my drinking and how it was negating all the good they saw in me. But I wouldn’t listen, I was too smart for them and never really considered I had a problem, especially when I compared myself with so many others who did what I did or worse.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Some of my friends reading this post remember those years. Very few friends from my past have stuck by me, but they are at ALDC now and remember these times as a dark period for me. Others reading this post have absolutely no idea that I ran with this demon for many years since most of you have never known me to drink.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And before I go any further, this is not a story about me being an alcoholic or a problem drinker. I don’t believe in these labels, if you do, that’’s fine, but I don’t and hopefully the real meaning of this story will be explained in this regard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">This is truly a story of a miracle that began on April 21, 1998. A miracle that continues to expand and bless me and everyone around me. This is a story of a true God that stopped me in my tracks and changed my life and the life hereafter in a way that only be described as a true miracle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">How Donna stayed with me all those years is a miracle even of itself. Only a true love on her part kept her around through many ups and downs, most of which I created by being so self centered and so self serving. But she did stay around. She threatened to leave many times if I didn’t stop drinking. I tried, I failed miserably every time. The truth is I loved my drinking more than I loved myself and my family. I couldn’t stop, I didn’t really want to stop. And the toll it took on Brian as a young boy is one story that he could spend lots of time telling all by himself. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Then on one particular day, April 21, 1998, I woke up, having had no special problems with Donna at that time but I felt as though a rock was hanging over my head and was going to drop soon and kill me. I woke up with the distinct impression that I needed to pray and find someway out of the hole I had dug myself in and everyone around me, especially my family.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I asked Donna to attend an AA meeting with me that morning. She did and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. People all around me that were talking about being sober or falling off the wagon, they did nothing for me. I left the AA meeting feeling more depressed than ever thinking I would never beat this problem and I was destined to die in my own vomit, probably divorced, with very few if any friends and I felt the lowest I had ever felt in my life.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Donna and I came home, she went to work and I decided to sit at the end of my dining room table and do the last thing I could think of doing. I prayed and sobbed to God that he would intervene in my life, take control and remove this insatiable desire to drink and help me clean up my life. I prayed and cried for hours, feeling no return for my emotional investment. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">And then as if lightning from the sky had hit me all at once, I felt a surreal spiritual and emotional awakening. I almost remember the exact second this happened. Out of the blue, God spoke to me, not in voice but in spirit and I could tell it was really something from without me, something that was truly intruding my spirit and speaking to me in a way I have never experienced in all my life. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">God made an instantaneous compact with me. He would remove the desire for me to drink IMMEDIATELY and I would compact with him to keep this commitment to never picking up another drink voluntarily again. And his spirit moved within me to accept this a true gift from God and to accept his unconditional gift as just that. It wasn’t deserved, it wasn’t earned, it had nothing to do with my own will or power. God was granting me a true miracle and all I had to do was recognize it as a true gift and miracle from God.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I have never had another drink or even experienced the slightest desire to drink since that very moment!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Now I want to make some things clear to everyone reading this. I don’t believe I was an alcoholic, I don’t believe in that label. I don’t pre-judge people that drink. I’ve seen social drinkers and not so social drinkers, but I believe that God has a plan for everyone in their lives and if drinking or some other vice is holding them back from realizing that blessing and that spiritual direction, then I pray that God will find a way to show them through their vice and allow them to grow spiritually as God intended for each one of them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">My drinking had prevented me for many years from realizing the plans that God was to set in motion for me following this miraculous event. It started with this miracle, but the ongoing miracles as a result of that initial miracle that I have personally been the recipient of, would never have come to me, had this not started on April 21, 1998. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I also want to make it clear, this was not my own doing. I didn’t have the willpower to stop on my own. This was truly a gift and miracle from God that he imparted to me without any effort on my part. He gave me the grace to cry out to him and moved my spirit to cry out for help, but it was his decision to grant this miracle and he has used this miracle to bless my life in so many ways that I can’t begin to count or praise him for all that he has done.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Having been diagnosed with this cancer, I wake up and thank God for that very special day and all the special days he has given me and my family since then. The business successes, the personal successes in my family, the many friends and supporters that I have now, that I never had prior to 1998. And most of all the respect of my peers, friends and partner who despite my other mental quirks, truly love and respect the person that God has been transforming me into since that very special day. I would much rather be in the place I am now, with cancer, than be in that place I was before April 21, 1998 and be healthy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I don’t like labels, I mentioned that before in a previous post. But I truly wanted to share one of the most awe inspiring moments of my life with you to take what you can from it. As you can tell, this is a pretty personal post. But more importantly, it is my testament that God is real, has a specific plan that continues to unfold in my life and has a specific plan for your life as well. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be alive and reading this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">I’ve had this deep yearning to share this testimony with you on my heart for some time, and in fact wake up in the middle of the night as I did last night and wonder why I hadn’t yet taken the time to write this down. God has been moving within me to share this experience with all of you, but I have already done so personally with some of you as well. But I guess it was finally time. I apologize for the long post, there was much more that I could have written. But I just wanted you to know that I am at peace with my situation if for no other reason than the many blessings and miracles from God since that day that I would never experienced otherwise. I thank God for manifesting his love to me personally and through each and every one of you. Thank you everyone!</span></p>
