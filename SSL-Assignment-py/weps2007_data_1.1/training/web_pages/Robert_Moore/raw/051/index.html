            <p> <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robert 
              Moore had hiked world class terrain for more than 10 years from 
              the mountains of Alaska and Canada to the Rocky Mountain's Wind 
              River range. His friends and climbing partners call him an elite 
              alpinist who spent up to 80 days a year traversing rock and ice 
              walls. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So his day trip Sunday to Maple Canyon in Sanpete 
              County seemed routine -- especially considering he'd done it before. 
              But just 20 feet from the top, Moore, 35, noticed a horizontal crack 
              in the ice. Thinking it would hold, he placed another two screws 
              into the frozen wall as he advanced up the rope. "He was just about 
              to the top when the whole thing collapsed," said Mike Morris, one 
              of three climbing partners and friends, who choked back tears while 
              talking to reporters Monday. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore died after plunging 100 feet, despite his 
              climbing partner's frantic attempts at resuscitation. The Sandy 
              man leaves behind a wife, two boys ages 5 and 3 and a 3-week-old 
              daughter. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends say Moore, who was born and raised in 
              Sandy, was a dedicated family man, who loved outdoor adventure, 
              golf and worked in real estate. "He was funny and lo</font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ud 
              but gentle as a deer," Morris said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 
              2:30 p.m., Moore and partner Marcus Porter were climbing the day's 
              second route -- what hikers call Frankenchrist -- when the thick 
              wall of ice broke free. Porter trekked out through thigh-deep snow 
              and found hikers with a cell phone who called search and rescue. 
              But due to massive trauma, immediate care could not have saved his 
              life, friends say. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike Morris, Moore's friend, who guides for climbers 
              around the world, said the duo had "favorable" conditions Sunday 
              even though the window for ice climbing in Maple Canyon can be as 
              short as two months. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's pretty safe if you're well-educated like 
              Robert and Marcus were," he said. "If Robert would have sensed [trouble] 
              he probably would have come back down." <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore placed six ice screws for protection in 
              the wall as he climbed, but when the ice collapsed, it took with 
              it the top two screws, and a third screw failed. The combined weight 
              of the climber and the slab of ice stressed the rope, causing Moore 
              to hit the ground. "A lot of it was rope stretch," said Nole Walkingshaw, 
              a climbing companion. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His love of mountaineering notwithstanding, friends 
              say Moore was most devoted to his children and thrilled about the 
              recent birth of his daughter. Friends of the Moore family hope to 
              pass Moore's passion for outdoor recreation on to his children as 
              they get older, said Walkingshaw. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trust fund for The Children of Robert Moore 
              has been created at Zions Bank. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morris, said those close to Moore feel "shattered" 
              by the loss. And losing an experienced member of Utah's climbing 
              community, he says, changes the sport. "This will always be in the 
              back of my mind for the rest of my life as I go into the mountains."
