  <p><b>A Tribute in Honor &amp; Memory of Robert (Pat) Edward Moore, Co Founder 
    of Rolfe Pentecostal Holiness Church, Rolfe, WV, in McDowell County.</b> </p>
  <p>Born in Dublin, Ireland, Robert Moore came to the United States when he was 
    a young man. He was of the Catholic faith. He became acquainted with the Pentecostal 
    through the healing of his child. He received the Holy Ghost and became a 
    strong Pentecostal believer. Most everyone knew him as Pat.</p>
  <p>It was in the spring of 1939, when the Rolfe Pentecostal Holiness Church 
    became a reality. Robert Edward Moore, who was the caretaker of Rolfe Grade 
    School felt the need of a Pentecostal Holiness church in the community. He 
    talked with the school board and they agreed to let Reverend C. A. Hensley 
    conduct a revival in the school. The revival was a great success. Many people 
    were saved, sanctified, and received the Holy Ghost. The Rolfe Church was 
    born and organized with Rev. C. A. Hensley as the first Pastor. Robert Moore 
    an his wife were very well known in the community, and Mr. Moore went to business 
    places and ask for contributions to help buy the lumber to build the church. 
    He worked along with the rest of the volunteer help. He worked as cofounder 
    along with Rev. Hensley. The first deacons were Roy Lambert from Algoma, George 
    Thornhill from Gilliam, and Dewey Adams from Rolfe, WV. Frank Morelock from 
    Algoma became the secretary and treasurer and then Sunday School teacher.</p>
  <p>Later on, Robert Moore and his wife Lula built the house that is still there 
    on the hill beside the church. There home was the home of all the evangelists 
    that came including Sylvia Harvey, who later became Sylvia Sexton, wife of 
    Dan Sexton, who became pastor in 1954. Rev. Joe Lilly spent every weekend 
    at the Moore home while pastoring the church. Joseph W. Moore, son of Robert 
    and Lula preached in the church after his safe return as POW during World 
    War Two.</p>
  <p>There is so much more I could say about my Father and his work in the church, 
    but I am happy to know that the church is still strong in the Lord after 57 
    years.</p>
