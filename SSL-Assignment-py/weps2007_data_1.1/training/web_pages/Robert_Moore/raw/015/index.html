<p>As a psychoanalytic scientist, Dr. Moore has worked on decoding and mapping the deep structures of the human self. His work on ritual process and the masculine psyche is today in the forefront of theory in masculine psychology, spirituality, and initiation.</p>
<p>The men's movement in the United States received a certain amount of notoreity for the practice of drumming. This practice needs to be understood in terms of ritual processes. Many of our human ancestors worked out ritual processes, some of which did involve drumming and dancing and singing. From his cross-cultural study of ritual processes, Dr. Moore became convinced of the value of ritual process in actuating human potential. More specifically, he became convinced that ritual processes at their best can provide liminal experiences for certain participants that are instrumental in enabling those participants to actuate the potential of archetypal sources of energy (that is, sources of energy at the archetypal level of the human psyche).</p>
<p>So far as we can tell, ritual processes have been a hit-and-miss business throughout all of human history. When they are most efficacious, they enable certain participants (but not necessarily all participants) to have a well-contained liminal experience that is instrumental in fostering further personal growth. However, ritual processes can fall short of this level of effectiveness for some participants (and at times perhaps for most), in which case the experience of the ritual process for the participants is refreshing (which Moore, following Victor Turner, styles a liminoid experience, as distinct from a liminal experience).</p>
<p>Moore's views regarding ritual processes can be found in the transcribed lectures and essays published in <i>The Archetype of Initiation: Sacred Space, Ritual Process, and Personal Transformation</i> (2001), discussed below.</p>
<p>In addition to writing and editing numerous books, Dr. Moore has frequently given short courses at the C. G. Jung Institutue of Chicago, many of which are available from the Institute on audiotapes.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_L._Moore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Five key books">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Five key books</span></h3>
<p>Moore is probably most widely known as the senior author, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Gillette" title="Douglas Gillette">Douglas Gillette</a>, of a series of five books on the in-depth structure of the human psyche, drawing on the account of the archetypal level of the human psyche developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">C.G. Jung</a>.</p>
<p>(1) <i>King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine</i> is an introductory overview of four key sources of energy at the archetypal level of the human psyche.</p>
<p>(2) <i>The King Within: Accessing the King in the Male Psyche</i> centers on the most important and most difficult source of energy for men to access.</p>
<p>(3) <i>The Warrior Within: Accessing the Knight in the Male Psyche</i> centers on the source of energy that boys and men usually learn how to access relatively early in life, but it takes time and effort to learn how to access the optimally mature form of this source of energy in the human psyche.</p>
<p>(4) <i>The Magician Within: Accessing the Shaman in the Male Psyche</i> centers on another form of energy that boys and men usually learn how to access at a relatively early age, but, once again, it takes time and effort to learn how to access the optimally mature form of this source of energy in the human psyche.</p>
<p>(5) <i>The Lover Within: Accessing the Lover in the Male Psyche</i> centers on a very tricky source of energy in the human psyche.</p>
<p>According to Moore and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Gillette" title="Douglas Gillette">Gillette</a>, for each optimal orientation for each of these four key sources of energy, there are two corresponding "shadow" forms of the source of the energy -- two ways for each of them to be misdirected for only one healthy or optimal way for each of them to be oriented. Just as the authors have given four key sources of energy in the human psyche very colorful names that seem to personify each source, so too the authors give each of the bipolor "shadow" forms very colorful names that seem to personify them.</p>
<p>Even though Moore stresses the positive potential of the archetypes of maturity, as he styles the healthy forms of the archetypes (as distinct from the "shadow" forms), he also stresses that archetypes are not friendly. By this he means that they can be dangerous because they can take over a person. So they are best approached with caution.</p>
<p>Moore has also noted that various forms of masculine behavior are immature, and so he thinks it is important for men today to develop guidelines for directing their own personal development and decision making.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_L._Moore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Works of related interest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Works of related interest</span></h4>
<p>One reviewer has sharply criticized Moore and Gillette for failing to advert explicitly to the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Dum%C3%A9zil" title="Georges Dumézil">Georges Dumézil</a>. No doubt credit should be given where credit is due, and the reviewer pointedly faults the authors for giving credit to Dumezil for his work along some similar lines of thought. Regardless of whatever the merit may be in the reviewer's criticism, it is also possible to acknowledge that Moore and Gillette have not explicitly adverted to certain other works as a way to broaden the horizons of their discussion to take into account to show certain parallels and connections with related works.</p>
<p>Moore and Gillette do not happen to advert explicitly to Maurice B. McNamee's compendious survey of certain efforts in the past to develop explicitly a sense of masculine maturity and greatness in <i>Honor and the Epic Hero: A Study of the Shifting Concept of Magnanimity in Philosophy and Epic Poetry</i> (1960). The term "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity" title="Magnanimity">magnanimity</a>" means "great spirited." As the sub-title indicates, the concept of what exactly constitutes great-spiritedness has shifted over the centuries, at least in part because of changing cultural conditions. In <i>Nietzsche Humanist</i> (1998: 110-11), Claude Pavur has in effect picked up the historical survey about where McNamee left off. As Pavur notes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Renaudet" title="Augustin Renaudet">Augustin Renaudet</a> (1958) has characterized the early modern humanists as pursuing "a mystique or ethic of human greatness or nobility." Pavur, then, locates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>'s famous formulation of the Ubermensch in the context of humanist thought, where it fits in.</p>
<p>Moore and Gillette explicitly acknowledge that the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> of St. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola" title="Ignatius of Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a> represents one way to access and actuate the energies of the archetypal level of the human psyche (see <i>The King Within</i>, 1992: 105). In Renaudet's terminology, the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> aims to develop a mystique or ethic of human greatness or nobility. Ignatius of Loyola is one example of the kind of great-spirited man that Nietzsche envisioned as the Ubermensch.</p>
<p>Moore and Gillette do not happen to advert explicitly to Plato's famous imagery in the <i>Phaedrus</i> of a charioteer (logos) directing two strong horses (eros and thumos). But in the <i>Phaedrus</i> and the <i>Republic</i> three parts of the psyche (logos, eros, thumos) are discussed that are equivalent to three of the archetypes discussed by Moore and Gillette (Magician, Lover, Warrior, respectively). The philosopher-king discussed in Plato is probably best understood as embodying the mature form of the King archetype discussed by Moore and Gillette.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_L._Moore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Three recent books">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Three recent books</span></h3>
<p>The 21st century has seen the publication of three new books by Moore that carry forward certain dimensions of his thought.</p>
<p>(i) <i>The Archetype of Initiation</i> (2001) contains selected lectures and essays by Moore on sacred space, ritual process, and personal transformation. By the term "archetype" here Moore means the structure of personal initiation. By the term "initiation" here he means the processes whereby one leaves behind certain aspects of one's earlier life and moves toward a new constellation of one's life.</p>
<p>(ii) <i>The Magician and the Analyst</i> (2002) is a short treatise on the archetype of the Magus in occult spirituality and Jungian analysis. One usually moves from one constellation of one's life to a new constellation with the assistance of someone else, or of several others. The person(s) who plays this pivotal enabling role for someone else is drawing on energies at the archetypal level of the human psyche that Moore refers to as Magician energies or Magus energies.</p>
<p>(iii) <i>Facing the Dragon: Confronting Personal and Spiritual Grandiosity</i> (2003) is a collection of essays about various aspects of grandiosity. The point is to distinguish between grandiosity and true human greatness.</p>
