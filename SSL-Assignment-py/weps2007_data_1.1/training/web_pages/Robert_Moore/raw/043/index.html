</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#FF0099"><FONT SIZE=4></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=4></FONT>ROBERT E.  MOORE . ARCHITECT was formed in 1987 in Monroe, NC as full service Architecture firm.  Since our formation we have designed projects throughout the Southeast with a concentration in commercial construction.  These projects have varied in size and scale as well as contexts; urban, suburban, and rural.  We have developed new buildings, additions to existing structures and renovations.  These  experiences have allowed us to respond to a variety of client needs and aspirations while developing designs of creative distinction.<BR>
Although our work is a collaboration of the client and our staff each project is managed by our principal in order to allow the client ease of access to decisions affecting their project.  <BR>
We provide support for our clients in the form of programming, planning, design development, construction documents and administration.  We use engineers as consultants in structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineering, allowing our firm to remain flexible in determining the best consultants for each project.<BR>
Our firm was recognized by METAL ARCHITECTURE magazine in with Honorable Mention Award in the Renovation category for a project in Charlotte, NC.  This award was based on work throughout the United States.  Although recognition by a national publication is welcome it is our belief that ultimately recognition through client satisfaction by quality design is our goal as well as the goal of all good architecture.<BR>

</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#FF0099"><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=2></FONT>Our approach to design begins with the client, and develops through our response to their needs, goals and aspirations.  By working closely with each client we are able to respond to their concerns of program, site context, budget, as well as  environmental concerns.  Essential to this approach is the ability to listen.  Only by listening can careful attention be given to the client's concerns.  The response to these concerns can be a knowledgeable and creative translation of these concerns and aspirations into built form.  <BR>
In a sense our approach is like an adventure in which we attempt to discover what is specific to the program, the client, the time and place of each project.  In essence it is a search for what a building wants to be and what it can achieve.<BR>
As we have said our process begins with the client.  After further development and enrichment of their program we develop alternative schemes that allow us to fully investigate the potentials of the site as a response to the program.  Then together with the client we evaluate these alternatives to determine which one is most appropriate.  Communication throughout this process is essential to success.  Testing the alternatives with respect to program, budget, architectural character, and other concerns helps to assure a satisfactory response.<BR>
Since our formation we have purposely stayed away from developing a particular look or style.  Instead we have attempted to develop an approach that allows the architectural character to evolve from all the relevant determinants.  We believe the architectural character of a building can be as diverse as the institutions they serve.  We hope our work will be recognized for its clean, fresh, and sincere qualities that reflect its cultural and geographic context.<FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR="#996633"><B><BR>
