<p>Night Fishing offers a different perspective on fishing in Charlotte Harbor and can
sometimes be a very productive method in fishing for gamefish. During the Winter months
the nights are cool and can offer some fantastic Snook action in and along the local canal
systems fishing lighted docks and bridges. During the late spring &amp; summer months when
the sun starts to fall and the moon rises, the Tarpon action becomes explosive along the
shadow lines of the local bridges that cross Upper Charlotte Harbor. Snook &amp; Tarpon
are nocturnal feeders and sometimes feed better at night depending on the tide and moon
phase. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Capt. Robert offers two types of night trips: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>Night Snook Fishing: During the winter months, Snook look for refuge in the deep water
canal systems along Upper Charlotte Harbor and can offer an exciting alternative to
fishing snook during the day. Live shinners, jumbo shrimp, finger mullet and artificial
baits are the best bets. Tides dictate the success of fishing for snook, therefore there
is limited nights available for this type of fishing. Contact Capt. Robert for the best
nights available. </p>

<p><img src="catch9.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="240"> <br>
<br>
Night Tarpon Fishing: Night fishing for Tarpon in the late spring and summer months is
truly an experience everyone should experience. The nights are cool and comfortable
following the typical afternoon thunderstorms and with the right tides the Tarpon action
can only be described as unbelievable. A shadow line is formed from the lighted bridges
that cross over Charlotte Harbor which can create a buffet for feeding Tarpon as bait fish
are swept through. There is a wide range on the size of Tarpon during night fishing with
the average Tarpon weighing in at 25lbs. But the possibility of hooking a 100lb+ Tarpon is
always a definite possibility. Live and artificial baits &amp; possibly a fly are the best
bets. As with snook, tides dictate the success for Tarpon. Contact Capt. Robert for the
best nights available during the late spring and summer months to fish for Tarpon. </p>

Charlotte area. While specializing in light tackle, flyfishing is available upon request.

season, get in some <b>World Class Tarpon</b> fishing in the Boca Grande area . He is

<p>One of the best kept secrets in Southwest Florida is how great the Tarpon Fishing is in
Upper Charlotte Harbor during the summer months. The secret is getting out though as many
guides are now traveling from as far as Tampa Bay, Orlando, Naples and other areas of
Florida just to fish Charlotte Harbor for the magnificent <u><em><strong>Silver King</strong></em></u>.
As a native to Charlotte Harbor, Capt. Robert has been fishing this area for Tarpon for
over 10 years and is known by many as the <em>&quot;Tarponman&quot;.</em> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Capt. Robert offers several types of Tarpon Fishing in this area:</b>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Smith-Tarpon.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="316"> </p>
<b>

<p>Upper Charlotte Harbor &amp; River Tarpon Fishing:</b> Fish the darkened waters of
Charlotte Harbor, Peace River or Myakka River for Tarpon Ranging in size from 40-150 lbs.
Live Bait, pass crabs or artificial baits offer a variety of fishing methods. Sight
fishing for rolling Tarpon or drifting live baits through schools of roaming fish are the
best bets. The months May through Septembe<strong>r</strong> are traditionally the best
months for this type of fishing. </p>

<p><b>Light Tackle Tarpon Fishing:</b> Fishing around bridges &amp; local canal systems
using light tackle for Tarpon ranging in size from 10-40 lbs. These frisky and fun to
catch juvenile Tarpon are best taken on live or artificial baits using light weight
tackle. The months May through September are traditionally the best months for this type
of fishing. </p>

<p><b>Beach Tarpon Fishing:</b> Sight fish the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico for rolling
and &quot;daisy chaining&quot; Tarpon using live bait, pass crabs or artificial baits.
Average size ranges from 60-150 lbs. The opportunity for this type of fishing is short and
the month of May is traditionally the best month. </p>

<p>Since it involves the magnificent <em><strong>Silver King</strong></em> each of the
above types of fishing is unique and exciting and will certainly challenge anyone's
angling skills. </p>
