<P><FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT>n September 23, 1984, Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) epidemiologist James Curran was in Manhattan to address a meeting
of the New York Physicians for Human Rights. &quot;AIDS will certainly be
the major cause of death during the lifetime of everyone here, and probably
through the twenty-first century,&quot; he told the group of two hundred
gay physicians. &quot;In spite of good intentions and continuing efforts
of the gay community and scientific sector, we should not expect scientific
technology to rescue us from AIDS in the next few years, although eventually
technology may help conquer the disease.&quot;</P>

<P>As the U.S. government's unofficial AIDS ambassador, Curran traveled
around the nation and the world helping people understand the deadly power
of the epidemic. To underscore how widespread the problem would become,
he informed the assembled doctors that in the next five years twenty-five
thousand Americans would have AIDS.</P>

<P>&quot;Ironically, Curran's projections that night vastly <I>underestimated</I>
the scope of the AIDS epidemic,&quot; journalist Randy Shilts wrote in <I>And
the Band Played On</I>, his in-depth examination of the AIDS crisis. &quot;There
would be twenty-five thousand AIDS cases within two years, not five, and
by then, the estimates of infected Americans would increase fivefold.&quot;</P>

<P>Things have only gotten worse. Since the first AIDS case was identified
in 1981, 270,870 Americans have died from the disease, and the World Health
Organization estimates that by the year 2000 between 30 million and 40 million
people worldwide will test positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But the most disturbing facet of the crisis surrounding AIDS, which researchers
have described as &quot;the nastiest microbe humanity has encountered in
centuries, if not in all of human history,&quot; eschews numerical tabulation.
According to Curran, &quot;We're really just at the beginning of the disease.&quot;</P>

<P>After more than two decades of work with the CDC, Curran recently accepted
the position of dean of the Rollins School of Public Health. Before joining
the University, he was acting director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS
Prevention and assistant surgeon general of the United States. When President
Bill Clinton learned about his career move, he sent Curran a letter of thanks
for his efforts at the CDC. &quot;Your work at the CDC and as an Assistant
Surgeon General in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps has exemplified
the energy, compassion, and scientific integrity that makes our nation a
pioneer in disease prevention and health promotion worldwide,&quot; the
President wrote. &quot;Your leadership in the area of HIV and AIDS prevention
has strengthened our global response to this epidemic and served as a calm
voice of scientific reason during some difficult times.&quot;</P>

<P>Curran said he was drawn to his new position for two reasons: the reputation
and the location of the School of Public Health. &quot;Although it's only
five years old, the School of Public Health has its strong roots within
the medical school and <A HREF="http://www.cc.emory.edu/WHSC/">Health Sciences
Center</A> at Emory and is really poised for the next move up in distinction,&quot;
says Curran from his corner office on the eighth floor of the <A HREF="http://www.cc.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/summer95/pubhealthsidebar.html">Grace
Crum Rollins Building</A>, which boasts a spectacular view of downtown Atlanta.
&quot;It is already one of the better schools of public health in the country,
and it has, of course, wonderful facilities.&quot;</P>

<P>In 1990, the School of Public Health became the first new school founded
at the University in more than seventy years. Offering both master's and
doctoral degrees, it is one of the nation's fastest growing public health
programs, and it recently moved into the state-of-the-art, 140,000-square-foot
Rollins Building. Dedicated to promoting health and preventing illness in
the United States and around the world, the school has ninety full-time
faculty members and more than two hundred adjunct faculty in six academic
departments: behavioral sciences and health education, biostatistics, environmental
and occupational health, epidemiology, health policy and management, and
international health. Some 650 students representing more than forty nations
are enrolled in the School of Public Health, and to date <A HREF="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/summer96/proescholdcomm.html">graduates</A>
have gone on to work in more than forty-five nations.</P>

<P>Another factor that motivated Curran's move is the School of Public Health's
location in what he describes as the &quot;public health capital of the
world&quot;--adjacent to the CDC and near the <A HREF="http://www.cc.emory.edu/CARTER_CENTER/">Carter
Center</A>, CARE, and the American Cancer Society's national headquarters.
Curran says one of his primary goals will be to strengthen the already solid
bonds between Emory and those institutions. &quot;We have to build upon
our unique situation,&quot; he explains. &quot;We clearly want to improve
what we do in international health and improve our collaborations with the
Carter Center, CARE, and the CDC. We want to take advantage of our ability
to add value to these partnerships.&quot;</P>

<P>Even though his main task will be running the School of Public Health,
Curran will continue his research and work in HIV/AIDS, and he will use
his connections at the CDC to facilitate greater involvement of the School
of Public Health in HIV/AIDS research. &quot;I've been working in the areas
of surveillance, research, and prevention of HIV since 1981,&quot; he says.
&quot;I intend to retain a very strong interest in that area. It's not quite
clear the extent that I'll be involved in HIV research, but I would like
to help Emory University contribute and also personally contribute to the
prevention of HIV in the United States and throughout the world.&quot;</P>

<P>The School of Public Health is already heavily involved in the fight
against AIDS, and numerous research projects are underway. For the past
two and a half years, Ronald Braithwaite, an associate professor in the
<A HREF="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpbshe.html">Department of Behavioral
Sciences and Health Education</A>, has been examining and evaluating HIV/AIDS
prevention programs in prisons. Claire Sterk-Elifson, an associate professor
and associate director of the <A HREF="http://www.sph.emory.edu/catalog/wcc.html">Women's
and Children's Center</A>, is researching women and HIV infection and is
involved in an evaluation of an outreach program that aims to reduce HIV
transmission in Atlanta's inner-city neighborhoods. And Professor of Biostatistics
Ira Longini is working on two projects. He and several colleagues are developing
methods for estimating the efficacy of a prophylactic HIV vaccine to be
used in upcoming vaccine trials, and he is overseeing a Ph.D. student who
is continuing research he began on developing statistical models for monitoring
the progression of HIV-infected individuals. According to Longini, those
models have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions such
as AZT and other anti-virals and to project the size of the HIV epidemic.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/summer96/diiorio.html"><IMG SRC="diiorio2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="12"
hspace="12"></A>Colleen DiIorio, a professor in the Department of Behavioral
Sciences and Health Education, is the lead investigator on several AIDS-related
projects, including a study of the influence of family on whether or not
children practice HIV-prevention strategies, and a study of the use of HIV-prevention
practices among Atlanta-area college students. DiIorio is one of several
public health faculty members working to evaluate &quot;Let's Talk About
AIDS,&quot; a theatrical performance for middle school students designed
to increase AIDS awareness and postpone sexual activity, funded by the non-profit
Project M.A.G.I.C. (Making AIDS Go away In Children). She is also involved
in Project Light, an intervention program for people living in downtown
Atlanta who are at high risk for contracting AIDS. According to DiIorio,
&quot;We teach them about HIV and AIDS, as well as skills they can use to
prevent HIV, such as condom use and negotiation for safe sex in their relationships.&quot;</P>

<P>Another School of Public Health faculty member heavily involved in AIDS
research is Stephen Thomas, an associate professor of community health in
the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education and director
of the Minority Health Research Laboratory. <A HREF="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/summer96/thomas.html"><IMG SRC=
"thomas2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" vspace="12" hspace="12"></A>Thomas is currently
working with the African-American faith community to help strengthen its
ability to influence the behavior of young people at risk for HIV. He says
the aim of this project &quot;is for the faith community, mass media outlets,
gospel music radio stations, and other community partners to link together
to enhance HIV education and related services that support AIDS risk reduction.&quot;</P>

<P>Even though Thomas says he is looking forward to the expertise and leadership
Curran will bring to AIDS research at the School of Public Health, he is
quick to recognize that Curran was a mentor for many on the faculty even
before he arrived. &quot;Dr. Curran is dean of the Rollins School of Public
Health, but he is also the `dean' of AIDS prevention all across the nation,&quot;
says Thomas. &quot;His leadership at the CDC shaped much of the national
and international research agenda on the prevention of HIV disease. He is
a national treasure, and his influence stretches around the globe.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>J</FONT>ames Curran was one of the first scientists to
come in contact with the disease that would eventually become known as AIDS.
After attending the University of Notre Dame, he earned a medical degree
from the University of Michigan in 1970 and a master's degree in public
health from Harvard University in 1974. He then worked in Columbus, Ohio,
as assistant commissioner of health, assistant professor at the Ohio State
University College of Medicine, and as a clinical research investigator
and coordinator for the CDC's Venereal Disease Control Division. In 1978,
Curran moved to Atlanta to be the CDC's chief of the Research Branch, Sexually
Transmitted Disease Control Division. One of the projects he was involved
in was hepatitis-B vaccine trials in gay men. In early 1981, he was asked
to review the draft of an article submitted to the CDC's journal <I>Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report</I> . The article concerned five cases of a
rare immune-system-related disease, <I>Pneumocystis carinii</I> pneumonia
(PCP), all of which were discovered in gay men. Curran says because the
cases were found in openly gay men, &quot;it looked like it could be something
that might be sexually transmitted.&quot;</P>

<P>The week of the publication of that article, Curran was in California,
where colleagues who were also working on the hepatitis-B study told him
they too had seen cases of PCP, and he began to think the problem could
be more widespread. Soon after that trip to California, Curran was asked
to fly to New York to examine a man suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare
skin cancer that would become a common ailment in AIDS patients. Curran
says it was during that meeting that he developed a personal connection
to the plague that he would spend his professional life fighting.</P>

<P>&quot;The man was a very handsome actor who was almost precisely my age,&quot;
Curran recalls. &quot;He had come from suburban Detroit as I had and had
attended a private college as I had. He had left Detroit in part because
he wanted to be an actor and in part because he was gay and he wanted to
be in a different community. And he had these funny little blotches on his
skin. I was thinking how similar this man's background was to mine, and
as I continued to know him over the next year before he died, and watched
him lose some one hundred pounds and lose his hair and waste away, I continued
to have a personalized link to this case. I realized that this was another
example of how diseases aren't fair, and that preventable illnesses shouldn't
be accepted, and that we needed to get to the bottom of this and make things
better.&quot;</P>

<P>Because of AIDS' lengthy latency, which can last for years, Curran and
other researchers had no idea of the extent of the epidemic. In the first
six months, there were about one hundred documented cases, but it wasn't
until the first hemophiliac developed AIDS in late 1982 that all the pieces
began coming together. &quot;It then became absolutely apparent to everyone
that this was a condition which was likely to be transmitted by a virus
in the blood supply,&quot; Curran explains. &quot;And that had implications
beyond the ability to control risk through personal behavior and beyond
our borders, since blood products for persons with hemophilia were shipped
worldwide from the United States.&quot;</P>

<P>But the staggering proliferation of the disease wasn't finally understood
until 1985, when an antibody test was developed that could detect HIV infection
in the blood. According to Curran, the application of the antibody test
to populations that had been previously used as controls, including hemophiliacs
and gay men without the disease, showed that the presence of the antibody
was many hundreds of times more common than the disease. It was then, he
says, that researchers &quot;realized that in the United States there were
literally hundreds of times more people infected with the virus than had
been diagnosed. In the United States, we probably had a quarter of a million
people infected before the first five cases were reported.&quot;</P>

<P>Curran says the disease is now leveling off in this country. &quot;Not
going down,&quot; he cautions, &quot;but leveling off. In the next half
dozen years, we'll see fifty to sixty thousand deaths per year, and since
1982 AIDS has become the leading cause of death of men and women between
twenty-five and forty-four.&quot;</P>

<P>Curran fears the biggest roadblocks in the fight against AIDS are apathy
and acceptance. Ironically, he attributes these problems to medical and
research advances that have been made in the fight against AIDS. He says
it was remarkable what was accomplished in the first five years of the epidemic--the
disease's modes of transmission were discovered, prevention recommendations
were made, the virus antibody test was discovered, the blood supply was
protected, and AZT was licensed as a treatment for AIDS. However, Curran
says those breakthroughs led to unreasonable expectations as people began
to expect a vaccine by 1988 and a cure by 1989. In fact, in the spring of
1984, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler predicted
at a press conference announcing the development of an HIV test that in
two years a vaccine would be developed. When those advancements didn't happen,
people began to see AIDS as an intractable situation, and when hope went
by the wayside, attention and concern for the epidemic began to wane.</P>

<P>&quot;The thing I'm concerned about worldwide is that AIDS will become
a part of our landscape and it will be acceptable,&quot; he says. &quot;There
is a risk that we will begin to see AIDS at some inevitable level in industrialized
countries and we will lessen our concern and commitment about it, which
translates into virtually no concern worldwide. We need to maintain worldwide
concern, and I think the commitment on a worldwide basis is clearly on the
decline, from the U.S. government's point of view, the Agency for International
Development's point of view, our own congressional interest, and U.N. support,
and I'm worried about that.&quot;</P>

<P>Still, Curran is not without hope. In the past several years, scientists
have made several breakthroughs that are helping AIDS patients live longer.
They include improvements in the management of opportunistic infections
and the development of protease inhibitors, drugs that block the enzyme
that creates protease, a building block of the virus. &quot;We're not anywhere
near where we need to be, but I think we now see more avenues for therapy
approaches,&quot; he says. &quot;These things take some time, and the important
thing is steady progress.&quot;</P>
