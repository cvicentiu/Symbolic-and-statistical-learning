    <P><B>1. FAVOURITE CURRENT PLAYER &amp; WHY? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Mark Janney, he is so fast and
      he shouldn't be wasted on the subs bench. </P>
    
    <P><B>2. FAVOURITE PLAYER OF ALL TIME &amp; WHY? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Ian Richardson, he used to play
      for the team and not for himself. I was a bit upset when he left for Notts
      County, but he seems to have done ok for himself.</P>
    
    <P><B>3. BEST TEAM PERFORMANCE? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Umbro Trophy semi-final replay
      against Gloucester City at Slough, and we went a goal down.</P>
    
    <P><B>4. WORST TEAM PERFORMANCE? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> A few to choose from, probably
      away to St.Albans last season when we were beat 2-0. I still can't believe
      Cobb was subbed off !!</P>
    
    <P><B>5. BEST GOAL 1997/98 SEASON?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Danny Shipps scissor kick vs.
      Southend in the Essex Senior Cup semi-final.</P>
    
    <P><B>6. BEST GOAL OF ALL TIME?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> John Stimson's superb shot in
      the semi-final again versus Gloucester City. (His second one, I mean.)</P>
    
    <P><B>7. MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Arriving at the twin towers in
      my Dagenham &amp; Redbridge shirt. It was worth all of the stress. </P>
    
    <P><B>8. MOST FORGETTABLE MOMENT?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Must be Tony Rogers being sent
      off. . </P>
    
    <P><B>9. BEST COMMENT HEARD FROM THE TERRACES</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> &quot;Oi Shippy, you carthorse.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P><B>10. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO THE CLUB TO IMPROVE IT?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Drainage, lower admission
      prices for children, and veggie burgers. </P>
    
    <P><B>11. DO YOU FOLLOW A FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUB IF SO WHO? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> None</P>
    
    <P><B>12. WHAT OTHER QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ON THIS QUESTIONAIRE?
      </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> What do you think of the press
      coverage D &amp; R recieve? </P>
    
    <P><B>13. WHY DO YOU SUPPORT A NON-LEAGUE CLUB LIKE DAGENHAM &amp;
      REDBRIDGE F.C </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> It is more fun supporting a
      local team because you get to know the supporters and the players, which
      you can't really do in the Premiership. </P>
    
    <P><B>14. FAVOURITE MATCH BEEN TO NOT INVOLVING THE DAGGERS? </B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Plymouth Argyle VS Exeter </P>
    
    <P><B>15. FAVOURITE NON &amp; FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUND VISITED EXCLUDING
      WEMBLEY?</B><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">J.C.</FONT></B> Aldershots Rec, because of the
      space behind the far goal.</P>
