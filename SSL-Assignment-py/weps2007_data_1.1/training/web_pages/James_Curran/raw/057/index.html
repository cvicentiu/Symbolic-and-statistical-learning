      <h1>The end of identity? Reflections on political leadership and Australian 
        nationalism in the post 1960s era</h1>
      <h4>Dr James Curran</h4>
      <p>It is worth recalling that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the 
        Queen&#8217;s 1954 Royal Tour to Australia. The first ever visit by a 
        reigning monarch to Australia produced the most significant demonstration 
        of British race sentiment in Australia&#8217;s history. This was the moment 
        the nation had long waited for: A regal footprint on <em>terra australis</em> 
        became the indelible proof for many that Australians would forever be 
        a British people. On the day of the Queen&#8217;s arrival in Sydney, The 
        <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> affirmed that 'To Australians the Queen 
        especially represents the tradition they have inherited from England &hellip; 
        Australia is still and always will be a British nation whose greatest 
        strength lies in the tradition she has inherited from England'. The Queen 
        embodied the 'supreme achievement of the British race'. The <em>Bulletin</em> 
        declared that 'the Royal visit completes the nationhood of Australia'. 
      <p>That was a mere half a century ago, but when the idea of Britishness 
        imploded under the weight of changing circumstances in the decade that 
        followed the Royal Tour the result was a crisis of national meaning. Ten 
        years following the Queen&#8217;s visit, Australia witnessed the emergence 
        of its first truly national daily newspaper, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s <em>Australian</em>. 
        And whilst it greeted its new readers with the rather strained headline 
        of 'Good Day' instead of &#8216;G&#8217;day &#8211; surely a cheap gesture 
        to respectability &#8211; its first editorial was entitled &#8216;facing 
        the challenge of adulthood&#8217;. The message was unequivocal: Australia 
        had not yet grown up. Sound familiar? </p>
      <p>The difference was that <em>The Australian</em> was not cynically pursuing 
        its own self-interest and setting itself up as the new organ of national 
        debate &#8211; it was reacting to a profound set of international developments 
        &#8211; the retreat of the old British, French and Dutch colonial powers 
        back to Europe, the rise of Asian nationalism and the emergence of what 
        it termed the &#8216;brooding power and &#8230; intelligence of the new 
        China&#8217;. No longer, the argument went, could Australia close its 
        eyes to the rest of the world and curl up under a cosy blanket of British 
        comfort. Even the economic imperative of making money was simply not enough. 
        If Australia was to be a real nation &#8211; it needed maturity &hellip; 
        and it needed it fast. But how are we to explain this sudden desire to 
        stand up and be counted, to throw off the shackles of the past and grasp 
        the nettle of independence? </p>
      <p>In the eyes of <em>The Australian</em> in its very first issue in July 
        1964, there was one hard fact which stood out above all: 'Of all the rapid 
        changes we have had to digest in recent times', it noted, 'it may be that 
        one event helped to bring all this home to us, to make us realise that, 
        like children facing adulthood, we had indeed left home. That event was 
        the British desire to join the European Common Market. Having fought against 
        the Motherland for so long, the burning desire of Mother to leave us to 
        our own affairs was a shock. It was a salutary shock. For it helped to 
        make us understand that now, as never before in our short history, we 
        stand alone. To many of us this is still a frightening thing to think 
        of. We are reluctant to consider long-standing policies and attitudes 
        which may now be inappropriate for the times &#8211; and for our national 
        survival &hellip; we are reluctant to think about the need for sacrifice 
        in areas like defence, foreign aid, cherished immigration policies and 
        racial attitudes &#8230;' </p>
      <p>Editorials are wont to adopt an absolute stance, but on this occasion 
        <em>The Australian</em> had hit the mark. In his important and timely 
        work, <em>Australia and the British Embrace &#8211; The Demise of the 
        Imperial Ideal </em>(MUP 2001), Stuart Ward critically examined Australian 
        reactions to Britain&#8217;s decision to seek membership of the European 
        Economic Community between 1961and 1963 and concluded that the &#8216;remarkably 
        sudden realisation that Britain was determined to pursue a new relationship 
        with Western Europe, which could no longer be reconciled with the idea 
        of a worldwide community of British peoples, served to render the imperial 
        imagination obsolete in Australian political discourse, and ushered in 
        new ways of thinking about an exclusively national Australian future'.</p>
      <p>Thus from this time Australian Prime Ministers were faced with an emotional 
        muddle and a rhetorical dilemma. The inability of Britishness to act as 
        a focus for Australian policies and priorities left a void in the Australian 
        self-image. One of the most fundamental ideas in Australian cultural and 
        political life, the belief that Australians were part of an &#8216;organic&#8217; 
        worldwide community of British peoples, had to be significantly revised 
        at this time. A people who had identified themselves so intensely with 
        the British race, who saw themselves as a bastion of this race in the 
        southern seas, now had to shelve their race consciousness and embrace 
        the notion of being a &#8216;multicultural&#8217; community. As the old, 
        monolithic British story lost its vitality these leaders had to make sense 
        of a new era, characterised by a diversity of cultures, especially those 
        of Asia. Since Britishness had given such powerful meaning and cohesion 
        to the people, what would replace it?</p>
      <p>Only gradually &#8211; and in some cases reluctantly &#8211; are Australians 
        coming to realise that the demise of Britishness constitutes perhaps the 
        single most important theme in 20th century Australian history. The emergence 
        of multiculturalism as a response to this once intense white Britishness, 
        the attempt to bring the Indigenous peoples &#8211; for so long excluded 
        from an idea of the nation &#8211; into the concept of a &#8216;new Australia&#8217;, 
        and the beginning of a serious attempt by governments to engage with the 
        countries and cultures of Asia are all to a greater or lesser extent connected 
        with the implosion of the British race idea. But in an era of such vast 
        and rapid social, economic and cultural transformation, Australians have 
        not found it easy to balance a respect for the British heritage with the 
        declining relevance of the British connection, and they have found it 
        difficult to construct a new language of community from the ashes of the 
        old British imperial lexicon. Indeed since the breaking of ties with Britain 
        there has been a curious attempt to either ignore or to play down the 
        significance of the British heritage in the Australian experience. If 
        we are a nation of immigrants, so this orthodoxy runs, why give the British 
        heritage pride of place? The problem has been one of what to do about 
        the nation&#8217;s British-centred past. </p>
      <p>The initial response to the collapse of Britishness as a defining idea 
        in national life betrayed a sense of shock and uncertainty about how to 
        deal with Australia&#8217;s new circumstances. In addition to finding 
        new markets for Australian products and confronting the basic economic 
        implications of Britain&#8217;s decision, both the intellectual and political 
        class were forced to confront the problem of identity. But as Harold Holt 
        admitted in early 1966, there had been no need for Australian leaders 
        to question the foundations of the national self-image since the late 
        19th century, remarking that Australia had been &#8216;jolted by events 
        to adulthood in circumstances of such complexity as to call for a maturity 
        and understanding perhaps as has not been expected of us in earlier periods 
        of our history&#8217;. For Holt therefore, Australian &#8216;adulthood&#8217; 
        was circumstantial, a product of historical forces beyond its control. 
        Far from being actively sought, &#8216;adulthood&#8217; had been thrust 
        upon them, and the shock caused a form of emotional paralysis on the question 
        of &#8216;national community&#8217;. Addressing the first convention of 
        the Young Australian Foundation at the University of Melbourne in March 
        1966, just two months after taking over the prime ministership from Sir 
        Robert Menzies, Holt confessed:</p>
      <p class="miniindent">In my day, we looked to the United Kingdom and the 
        British Navy. People thought in terms of the British Isles as home. Here, 
        while our affection remains for the lands of our kith and kin &#8211; 
        for most of us that has been the situation &#8211; we have now realised 
        that Australia has a national independent entity of its own and that Australia 
        faces problems and has obligations which are quite unlike anything the 
        earlier generations of Australians had to meet. And so we can&#8217;t 
        offer you a tremendous amount by way of guidance because a precedent hasn&#8217;t 
        been able to serve us for the kind of situation we now face. But what 
        we &#8211; and I now speak for the older generation of Australians &#8211; 
        do offer to you is a comradeship together as we face the difficulties 
        and at the same time the fantastic possibilities that we see ahead of 
        a growing nation.</p>
      <p>Holt, though clearly hapless in trying to address the question of a possible 
        new Australian identity, was nevertheless fundamentally correct in his 
        view of history. Precedents did not exist. The past could neither instruct 
        nor guide. Britain&#8217;s decision that she would withdraw her military 
        presence from East of Suez by the early 1970s only added to the angst. 
        The dawning of the idea that Australia might be now &#8216;independent&#8217; 
        carried not only a certain responsibility, but also the need for self-confidence 
        and self-assurance which, by implication, Australians had previously based 
        on a British identity that had now been taken from them. The air of resignation 
        in Holt&#8217;s words betrayed puzzlement, almost helplessness, as if 
        such a reorientation of the traditional framework of Australian loyalties 
        was beyond the comprehension of those of his ilk. The sense of Britishness 
        had been so deeply internalised that its rapid removal left leaders such 
        as Holt grasping for alternatives. </p>
      <p>The problem, as I have said, was not the preserve of the political class 
        alone. As historian Geoffrey Serle commented in 1967, &#8216;There has 
        been such a vacuum since the decline of standard imperial patriotic rhetoric 
        that it is difficult to make any sure statement&#8217;. And Serle was 
        not confident that a distinctively Australian sentiment was strong enough 
        to withstand the onslaught of Americanisation. &#8216;Anzackery&#8217;, 
        by which Serle meant &#8216;the recent flowering of a sense of Australian 
        history, the feeling for the bush tradition&#8217; was insufficiently 
        rooted in the national self-consciousness to withstand the strong cultural 
        winds blowing in from the other side of the Pacific. In 1969, Prime Minister 
        John Gorton admitted that he had not known a time &#8216;when change is 
        more in the air, both in our external policies and in our internal reappraisals 
        of things which have for so long been taken for granted. It is a time 
        when statements never previously questioned are increasingly subject to 
        analysis and criticism&#8217;. </p>
      <p>One of the more perceptive witnesses to the national mood at this time 
        was Donald Horne. In the mid 1960s he admonished the nation&#8217;s political 
        class because he felt that they did not know what to say once the idea 
        of Britishness had shown itself to be no longer relevant. Posing the hypothetical 
        question of how they were to respond to events other than those dictated 
        by the daily crises of domestic politics, he asked them: &#8216;what use 
        is Britishry to you now? &#8230; what point of reference does your Britishry 
        give you as a prompting to action? And when you speak to the people you 
        govern what do you say to them, when almost all that still touches your 
        imagination is something they are likely to laugh at anyway?&#8217; By 
        this reading, the Britishness of the Menzies era had become not only a 
        laughing stock but a dangerous anachronism &#8211; a mindset that threatened 
        to stifle the long-awaited process of national self-renewal. The problem, 
        though, was what to put in its place. In <em>The Lucky Country</em>, Horne 
        argued confidently that: &#8216;The very lack of any definite nationalism, 
        of statements on who Australians are and where they stand in history, 
        cannot be wholeheartedly deplored in an age that has seen so much horror 
        and cruelty unleashed in the name of nationalism&#8217;. Two years later, 
        at the beginning of John Gorton&#8217;s prime ministership, he similarly 
        observed that &#8216;There is a commendable emptiness in Australians about 
        their place in the world, the need for a new rhetoric, a new approach, 
        as if Australia were beginning all over again&#8217;. Horne understood 
        the dangers of nationalistic excess and the problem of the void in national 
        meaning, but he did not have an alternative national myth to which the 
        people might turn. Though he called for a return to the rhetoric of &#8216;comradeship&#8217;, 
        he knew that the image of Australia as a nation of &#8216;bushwhackers&#8217; 
        was unworkable &#8211; in the demographic and ideological sense. And he 
        might well have added that the radical nationalist bush legend never in 
        any case seriously challenged Britishness as the core national myth giving 
        meaning to the people. </p>
      <p>So how have Australians fared in this endeavour of finding a new language 
        of national community to fit the new circumstances? If we are to accept 
        the verdict of an editorial in <em>The Australian</em> of January 2003, 
        the answer is not very well at all. Approaching the celebration of Australia 
        Day, the editorial announced that &#8216;the days of great unifying statements 
        that define national identity are probably gone forever&#8217; and further 
        that &#8216;there is no point in lamenting if we cannot find any form 
        of words which explains our nation&#8217;s history, defines its values 
        and sets out its aspirations for the generations to come&#8217;. The debate 
        over a constitutional preamble showed how difficult it was to achieve 
        a workable yet eloquent statement of national values and priorities. For 
        his part, the Prime Minister on more than one occasion recently has remarked 
        that &#8216;we&#8217;ve brought to a respectable conclusion this perpetual 
        seminar on our national identity that went on&#8217;. Australia had &#8216;lifted 
        its head again&#8217;. For John Howard there should never have been the 
        &#8216;agony&#8217; of &#8216;navel-gazing&#8217; over being &#8216;too 
        Asian &#8230; or too British, too American. We&#8217;ve suddenly realised 
        what we&#8217;ve been all along, we&#8217;re just 100 per cent Australian&#8217;. 
      </p>
      <p>How is it, then, that in the space of only four decades Australia is, 
        in one sense, right back where it started, echoing Donald Horne and emphasising 
        the difficulty of finding a new language to give meaning to the life of 
        the nation. Or have we really gone beyond the problem of identity? In 
        getting to the heart of the matter what needs to be explained of course 
        is the problem of nationalism itself and how it has been understood in 
        the Australian experience. </p>
      <p>Writing in the mid-1960s, Hans Kohn argued that &#8216;the twentieth 
        century since 1945 has become the first period in history in which the 
        whole of mankind has accepted one and the same political attitude, that 
        of nationalism&#8217;. It should be remembered therefore that the &#8216;world-views&#8217; 
        of Prime Ministers Holt, Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke, Keating 
        and Howard were being shaped in an era where nationalism was the key idea 
        or myth connecting the individual to society. But this classical idea 
        of nationalism had a turbulent past, given its prescription for cultural 
        and racial uniformity, its absolute need to differentiate the unique qualities 
        of a &#8216;people&#8217; from those of their neighbours and its intrinsic 
        capacity for hostility to and oppression of the outsider. The nationalist 
        myth tells the story of a people becoming progressively aware of their 
        distinctiveness and of the gradual awakening of a national spirit which 
        will ultimately lead them to their independent &#8216;destiny&#8217;. 
        But scholars are increasingly questioning the aura of inevitability in 
        which nationalism clothes itself &#8211; the pre-destined journey towards 
        being a &#8216;nation at last&#8217;. </p>
      <p>In a perceptive series of articles in the early 1970s the historian Douglas 
        Cole emphasised the confusion which had beset those attempting to explain 
        the concepts of &#8216;nationalism&#8217; and &#8216;imperialism&#8217; 
        in British settlement colonies. The essential problem, according to Cole, 
        was that &#8216;The historians of Dominion nationalism have usually been 
        believers in the nationalist legend&#8217;, and that the &#8216;study 
        of the ideology has been infected by the ideology&#8217;. Hence Cole asserted 
        that &#8216;[a]n Australian nationalism, based on a consciousness of ethnic 
        differentiation, would have been incompatible with an imperial ideology 
        based upon the unity of blood, language, ancestry and tradition&#8217;. 
      </p>
      <p>This is not to deny the efforts of those who seemed impatient to break 
        free of this pervasive Britishness and establish for Australia a nationalism 
        of her own. In the 1940s and 1950s a &#8216;radical national&#8217; myth 
        claimed to locate an &#8216;organic&#8217; concept of national community, 
        one which sprang not from the &#8216;crimson thread of kinship&#8217;, 
        but from the connection with and response to the unique Australian landscape 
        and &#8216;bush&#8217; experience. Russel Ward&#8217;s book, <em>The Australian 
        Legend</em>, for example, was the most sophisticated and coherent expression 
        of a self-sufficient national myth, a myth that set Australians apart 
        from all other peoples. Ward examined the growth of an &#8216;Australian 
        national mystique&#8217; and traced its origins to the convicts, Irish, 
        itinerant bush workers, gold diggers and bushrangers of the nineteenth 
        century. He described them as a &#8216;singular social group&#8217; with 
        &#8216;an ethos which, though similar to those of certain other communities 
        distant in time and place, was in some ways unique&#8217;. The qualities 
        and values that they were seen to embody &#8211; mateship, collectivism, 
        improvisation and anti-authoritarianism &#8211; had been conditioned in 
        response to the harsh Australian frontier environment. By the time of 
        Federation, Ward argued, the &#8216;noble bushman&#8217; was enshrined 
        in both the popular and literary imagination. Yet even he was forced to 
        acknowledge the appeal of Britishness. Once the bitterness of the conscription 
        crises of 1916&#8211;17 had &#8216;faded into the background of consciousness&#8217; 
        Ward conceded &#8216;Australian patriotism does not usually or necessarily 
        involve weakening of attachment to Britain, but rather the reverse&#8217;. 
        The &#8216;radical nationalist&#8217; protest was against Britain treating 
        Australians as colonials, not against Britishness as such. </p>
      <p>But no Australian leaders invoked the &#8216;radical national&#8217; 
        bush myth and placed it in opposition to the British race myth as that 
        which might unify Australians and give them the sense of being &#8216;one 
        people&#8217;. </p>
      <p>More recently historian Neville Meaney has argued that what needs to 
        be remembered in dealing with nationalism is &#8216;the nature of the 
        phenomenon&#8217;, and that &#8216;the tests of nationalism for Australians 
        are not how partisan Australian spectators are at Test Matches, whether 
        Australians have different accents from the English or whether Australians 
        dislike inherited class distinctions or warm beer&#8217; in English pubs. 
        What has to be examined is the &#8216;idea that Australians have of themselves 
        as a people&#8217;. Meaney suggests it is worth contemplating &#8216;the 
        possibility that in the nationalist era &#8211; that is from the late 
        19th century down to the 1960s &#8211; Britishness was the dominant cultural 
        myth in Australia, the dominant social idea giving meaning to the people&#8217;. 
        In oaths of loyalty recited at public schools, in history curricula, on 
        public ceremonial occasions such as Anzac Day and Empire Day, and in their 
        anthems and patriotic songs, it is clear that Australians from the late 
        19th century down to the 1960s thought of themselves as &#8216;primarily 
        a British people&#8217;. </p>
      <p>And the nation&#8217;s leaders gave resonant voice to this idea. Even 
        a cursory glance at the rhetoric of Britishness reveals that the common 
        bonds of blood, heritage, history, language and literature tied Australia 
        firmly to the &#8216;mother country&#8217; for much of the 20th century. 
        Both sides of Australian politics embraced the basic tenets of the myth 
        of &#8216;British Race patriotism&#8217;. Alfred Deakin, in his 1905 Imperial 
        Federation address, articulated the kindred nature of the relationship 
        between Australians and Britons and the mystic ties of Empire: &#8216;The 
        same ties of blood, sympathy, and tradition which make us one Commonwealth 
        here make the British of today one people everywhere&#8217;. Whilst Deakin 
        used the word &#8216;nation&#8217; seven times in this address, only once 
        did it refer to Australia. He mostly implied a British &#8216;nation&#8217; 
        &#8211; which included Australians. Andrew Fisher&#8217;s 1914 pledge 
        to fight &#8216;to the last man and the last shilling&#8217; and Billy 
        Hughes&#8217; 1921 declaration that Australia was &#8216;a nation by the 
        grace of God and the British Empire&#8217; were the types of statements 
        which led Australian historian WK Hancock to express in the late 1920s 
        the classic assessment of Australia&#8217;s dual loyalties, that &#8216;among 
        Australians pride of race counted for more than love of country&#8217;. 
        Or as Hancock even more decisively put it, the Australians, proclaiming 
        themselves to be '98 per cent British' were &#8216;wont to boast&#8217; 
        that they were &#8216;far more British &#8230; than that diluted (and 
        therefore inferior) mixture in the British Isles&#8217;. </p>
      <p>The language of Labor Prime Minister John Curtin on this point is quite 
        instructive. Despite the cable battles with Churchill over the return 
        of Australian troops from the Middle East and the rancour caused by the 
        supposed &#8216;great betrayal&#8217; over the fall of Singapore, Curtin 
        was nevertheless of the view that closer imperial cooperation was necessary 
        to give substance and coherence to the Empire in a postwar world. In December 
        1943 he won the overwhelming endorsement of the Australian Labor Party 
        conference to take his proposal of a permanent Imperial secretariat to 
        the 1944 Prime Ministers' conference in London. Though his proposal was 
        torpedoed he was not reluctant in giving full voice to Australia&#8217;s 
        Britishness. Australia was defined as a &#8216;replica&#8217; of Britain, 
        a &#8216;microcosm&#8217; of the British way of life and Australians were 
        seen as being &#8216;not a bit different&#8217; to the British themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>During his speech to the Australian Club on that visit, he said:</p>
      <p class="miniindent">I can say that the dominant point of view in Australia 
        &#8211; and I know it to be the dominant point of view here in Britain 
        &#8211; is that we are one people. We are not only kith and kin, we have 
        the same cultural heritage, we speak the same language, we claim that 
        all the struggles for liberty that have been waged in this land, the motherland 
        and cradle of the rights of the people, were just as much the history 
        of the people of Australia as they were the history of the people of Britain.</p>
      <p>And it is this idea of being &#8216;one people&#8217; that constitutes 
        the true test of nationalism. Curtin and Chifley, it must be remembered, 
        also defined Australians as a &#8216;bastion of the British speaking race&#8217;, 
        and they used the phrase both in Australia and in Britain. Notwithstanding 
        the significant changes in the Australia&#8211;Britain relationship in 
        the postwar period &#8211; particularly in the areas of trade, defence 
        and diplomacy &#8211; the Prime Ministers in their rhetoric still maintained 
        the emotional link to the United Kingdom, recognised it as the foundation 
        of their values and traditions, and saw in the halcyon days of British 
        colonialism the birth of their own story. The key point here is: Curtin 
        and Chifley may not have pronounced themselves &#8216;British to their 
        boot-heels&#8217;, and they may not have referred to Britain as &#8216;home&#8217;, 
        but the imperial connection and the crimson thread of kinship were as 
        central to their idea of Australia as it was for that of the subsequent 
        Menzies ascendancy. </p>
      <p>The crisis of meaning for Australian leaders from the mid-1960s was therefore 
        double edged. On the one hand they had to accommodate the lingering attachment 
        which many felt to the idea of Britain as the &#8216;mother-country&#8217; 
        and as the great protector. On the other hand they had to discard the 
        more problematic aspects of their British-centred past &#8211; namely 
        its prescription for a white, British Australia &#8211; and fashion a 
        new language about the nation as a multicultural community. Initially, 
        the old language lived on side by side with the new. Thus Harold Holt 
        could talk of White Australia and British Imperialism dropping &#8216;away 
        into the mists&#8217; &#8211; a poignant image which still left the question 
        of what might appear once the mists cleared. As historian RG Collingwood 
        might have said &#8211; the prime ministers were indeed &#8216;wrestling 
        with a fog&#8217;. </p>
      <p>Holt&#8217;s successor, John Gorton, realised a problem of identity that 
        Curtin, Chifley and Menzies could never have imagined: &#8216;Who would 
        have thought&#8217;, he told a Liberal party dinner in 1968, &#8216;that 
        suddenly at this point in our nation&#8217;s history, all the old conceptions 
        would have to be taken out, have to be re-examined, to be re-assessed 
        because the world had changed and we had changed &#8230; no longer, as 
        was the case until a short time ago, do we live under the protection of 
        Great Britain and the British navy. That has gone&#8217;. Though Gorton 
        had shown an awareness of the problem, he did not make any significant 
        progress in resolving it. But he did, in a serious way, commence the process. 
        For him, Australia was almost a nation &#8211; reverting to the more traditional 
        familial metaphors of Australia having been a &#8216;child of the mother 
        country&#8217;, he said that it had grown to be an &#8216;adolescent nation&#8217;, 
        as he put it, &#8216;between the child stage and the world leader stage&#8217;. 
        As political journalist Alan Reid noted, Gorton wanted to &#8216;deepen 
        the sense of Australian nationalism, the type of emotional nationalism 
        that caused him to advocate adoption of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; as 
        Australia&#8217;s national song, but he clearly had not thought how to 
        achieve rather than exhort&#8217;.</p>
      <p>My recent book is an attempt to show that the central challenge for the 
        five major prime ministers in the post- Menzies period has been whether 
        or not they could offer an alternative myth of community which would preserve 
        social cohesion in the new era. Each of these leaders has brought his 
        unique &#8216;world-view&#8217; to this question, but there is nevertheless 
        a discernible pattern in their rhetoric.</p>
      <p>Gough Whitlam&#8217;s &#8216;new nationalism&#8217; of the early 1970s 
        was to be above all &#8216;benign and constructive&#8217;, emerging as 
        it did from Australia&#8217;s &#8216;quiescent and colonial past&#8217; 
        and rejecting the need for cultural and racial unity. For Whitlam, the 
        lack of &#8216;focus for nationalistic fervour and popular emotion&#8217; 
        in Australia was cause for optimism rather than despair. Whitlam had recognised 
        that Australia&#8217;s national story could not match nationalism&#8217;s 
        European equivalent for blood or civil strife, and he would not wish it 
        to do so even if it could. As one who had lived through and participated 
        in the second great European war of nationalism, Whitlam valued the Australian 
        difference. In early 1974 he urged the people to commit themselves to 
        a &#8216;greater Australia, not in any bombastic or chauvinistic sense, 
        but generously, humanely, out of regard for the welfare of our fellow 
        man and our neighbours&#8217;. In this guise the &#8216;new nationalism&#8217; 
        was equated with the welfare state at home and liberal internationalism 
        abroad &#8211; that is: for the most part, commitment to the United Nations 
        and an abiding faith in the international rule of law. The radical nationalists 
        may have cheered Whitlam&#8217;s rise to the prime ministership, but his 
        own rhetoric is a study in care and caution in the articulation of a new 
        kind of Australian nationalism. Whitlam&#8217;s achievement was to argue 
        with greater self-confidence and assertion than his predecessors the need 
        for Australia to stand on her own two feet. He introduced a new Australian 
        honours system, replaced God Save the Queen with Advance Australia Fair 
        and, following Deakin&#8217;s example, refused a privy councillorship. 
        But he was not attracted to the radical nationalist position of anti-Britishness. 
        Whitlam preferred an appeal to reason and logic rather than to tribal 
        emotions.</p>
      <p>Malcolm Fraser similarly dismissed the need for a boisterous Australian 
        nationalism, and was unequivocal in his acceptance that the British race 
        myth was no longer compatible with Australia&#8217;s changing circumstances. 
        In his Australia Day speech of 1977, he said: &#8216;Fortunately the days 
        of Anglo-Saxon conformity are over&#8217;, he said, &#8216;and I believe 
        we are all better off as a nation and as individuals because of this'. 
        He defined the new realities of Australian political culture thus: &#8216;Ethnic 
        cultures have added a new dimension of diversity and richness to the traditions 
        of those other migrants, the English, Scots and Irish. What is emerging 
        from this is a distinctive Australian culture &hellip;&#8217;. This was 
        the first time an Australian Prime Minister had so enthusiastically welcomed 
        an end to Australia&#8217;s once coveted racial homogeneity. The very 
        word &#8216;conformity&#8217; carried a negative, oppressive connotation, 
        and the idea of Britishness itself was fragmented into its constituent 
        parts: the English, Scots and Irish were merely &#8216;those other migrants&#8217; 
        who were incorporated into a continuum of migration. The idea of a &#8216;British-speaking 
        race&#8217; had been forever split asunder.</p>
      <p>But the question remained, how precisely had this &#8216;distinctive 
        Australian culture&#8217; emerged and what was its content? Fraser&#8217;s 
        embrace of the concept of &#8216;multiculturalism&#8217; &#8211; he defined 
        it as Australia&#8217;s &#8216;unique achievement&#8217; &#8211; gave 
        him the opportunity to try to define what held the nation together. For 
        Fraser, it was the &#8216;relative speed&#8217; with which the British 
        myth had been diluted in the postwar period which had made the multicultural 
        &#8216;achievement&#8217; all the more remarkable. But beneath this confidence, 
        Fraser gave voice to the residual difficulty in marking Australia&#8217;s 
        transition from monoculture to &#8216;multiculture&#8217;. Australia, 
        &#8216;small in size and insular in outlook&#8217;, had more or less &#8216;stumbled 
        into the multicultural epoch&#8217;. Like Holt&#8217;s image of &#8216;White 
        Australia&#8217; simply dropping &#8216;away into the mists&#8217;, Fraser&#8217;s 
        description of the nation &#8216;stumbling&#8217; into an era of ethnic 
        diversity evinced a similar haziness, as if the change was unforeseeable, 
        as if it had taken them by surprise. Multiculturalism may well have offered 
        a new myth of Australian distinctiveness, by virtue of its stark contrast 
        to British racial homogeneity, but it still struggled to offer a new myth 
        of national cohesion.</p>
      <p>Bob Hawke faced the problem of how to marry his deep-seated commitment 
        to consensus politics to a nation rapidly opening itself to the outside 
        world. But he too was keenly aware of nationalism&#8217;s tendencies to 
        the jingoistic. Hawke was adamant that the Australian Bicentenary in 1988 
        was no time for &#8216;vain glory or empty boasting&#8217; nor &#8216;meaningless 
        flag-waving or drum-thumping&#8217;. Australia, he believed, had reached 
        a &#8216;new maturity&#8217;, the purpose of which was to indicate that 
        Australians acknowledged the detrimental impact of European civilisation 
        on the Aboriginal population and appreciated the role of diverse immigration 
        in national life and growth. On Australia Day 1988 he described Australia 
        as a &#8216;nation of immigrants&#8217; and defined the cardinal virtue 
        of a &#8216;true Australian&#8217; as being the &#8216;commitment to Australia 
        &#8230; None of us is entitled to claim real &#8216;Australianness&#8217; 
        on the basis of ancestry alone&#8217;. However, at a citizenship ceremony 
        later that year Hawke was much more assertive in establishing what it 
        meant to be &#8216;Australian&#8217;: </p>
      <p class="miniindent">In pinpointing what makes us distinctively Australian&#8217;, 
        we acknowledge the enormous debt we owe to Britain. Britain has given 
        us the basis of many of the institutions of our free society: our system 
        of parliamentary democracy, the principles of rule by law and the protection 
        of the rights of the individual under the law, our system of liberal education. 
      </p>
      <p>Hawke formalised this view when he provided the foreword to the 1989 
        <em>National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia</em>. Australia&#8217;s 
        British inheritance was placed at the centre of Australian multiculturalism: 
        &#8216;Immigrants and refugees, selected from more than 140 countries, 
        have been attracted by our British heritage and institutions&#8217;. </p>
      <p>Thus Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke had all recognised that the need for an 
        intense nationalism had long since passed. Their response to the world 
        and to history had convinced them that a conformist, race-based nationalism 
        was a danger to freedom. </p>
      <p>However, Paul Keating could not so easily let the idea of nationalism 
        fade from the Australian political spectrum. His was a concept of nationhood 
        which &#8216;went beyond constitutional things&#8217; to the question 
        of &#8216;attitudes&#8217; &#8211; primarily those Anglo-centric attitudes 
        which he believed had &#8216;cost&#8217; Australia a more independent 
        voice in world affairs in the postwar era. Keating said that he understood 
        Australian history with a &#8216;capital A&#8217;. And so he berated Menzies 
        for having a &#8216;compromised nationalism&#8217;, that is a nationalism 
        which in Keating&#8217;s view had been unable to differentiate between 
        Australian and British interests, he lambasted the British over the fall 
        of Singapore during the Second World War and claimed that the event marked 
        the explosive beginning of Australia&#8217;s engagement with Asia. Keating&#8217;s 
        &#8216;capital A&#8217; history heralded Australian Prisoners of War as 
        the first pioneers of Australians in Asia and further held that in fighting 
        against the Japanese in the jungles of South East Asia, Australians had 
        learnt once and for all that they were fundamentally different &#8211; 
        in race as much as in outlook &#8211; from the British.</p>
      <p>Above all, Keating was impatient to claim Australian &#8216;independence&#8217;. 
        Speaking to the Australian book publishers awards in June 1992, he remarked 
        that:</p>
      <p class="miniindent">In the 1990s, without the slightest disrespect to 
        a country for which I have the greatest admiration, and to whose language 
        and institutions I am a very grateful heir, I want to see us leave home. 
        Of course, we do not remain there in any substantial material way &#8211; 
        but we are there emblematically and to a degree psychologically, and it 
        would be much better for us in the real world that we now inhabit if we 
        removed the emblems and excised the doubts. We need very badly that spirit 
        of independence and faith in ourselves which will enable us to shape a 
        role for ourselves in the region and the world.</p>
      <p>For Paul Keating political &#8216;leadership&#8217; in the 1990s was 
        primarily concerned with the goal of national self-realisation. In his 
        quest to find that seemingly elusive &#8216;spirit of independence&#8217;, 
        Keating by implication had stressed the limits of the symbolic changes 
        to Australian nationhood associated with the &#8216;new nationalism&#8217; 
        of the Whitlam period, the confidence with which Malcolm Fraser had greeted 
        the end of &#8216;Anglo-Saxon conformity&#8217; in the late 1970s, and 
        the passing of the Australia Act in 1986 under Hawke. For him, such measures 
        had not yet clinched Australia&#8217;s independent nationhood, Australia 
        could not yet pronounce itself to be &#8216;a nation at last&#8217;. Australians 
        in the 1990s, he argued, needed not only a new flag and a new oath of 
        citizenship, but also to be &#8216;independent in ways that we&#8217;ve 
        never been&#8217;. Essentially this entailed the creation of an Australian 
        republic and engagement with Asia. Yet the constraints on this &#8216;independence&#8217; 
        were both old and new. Not only had &#8216;&#8230; old imperial supports 
        contrived to make the matter of our independence a secondary concern&#8217;, 
        Australia&#8217;s ethnic diversity had added new complications to the 
        problem of defining &#8216;national community&#8217;: </p>
      <p class="miniindent">In the age of multicultural Australia we have not 
        by any means entirely replaced the old sentiments with unequivocally new 
        ones. Indeed, in a sense, multiculturalism has combined with the lingering 
        Britishness of the place to circumvent the emergence of a singularly Australian 
        identity to replace the old imperial one. </p>
      <p>Keating, although a consistent supporter of the principles of multiculturalism, 
        nevertheless seemed frustrated by its implications for the emergence of 
        a uniquely Australian cultural identity. He could not accept the viability 
        of a multicultural nationalism. In this speech Keating had balanced the 
        conspiratorial tone of &#8216;radical nationalism&#8217;, in which the 
        British heritage and multiculturalism had mischievously &#8216;thwarted&#8217; 
        the realisation of Australian &#8216;independence&#8217;, with a more 
        moderate statement of his &#8216;admiration&#8217; for the language and 
        institutions which Australia had derived from Britain. This is the central 
        conundrum of the Keating prime ministership: his sometimes vigorous &#8216;radical 
        nationalist&#8217; language in combination with near Churchillian overtures 
        of respect for Britain and Australia&#8217;s British heritage.</p>
      <p>Keating&#8217;s &#8216;aggressive Australianism&#8217; again sought for 
        Australia a romantic nationalism. He wanted Australians to have an identity 
        separate from the British race patriot tradition, since British imperialism 
        had denied them a true nationalist experience of their own. Yet Keating 
        also came to express an awareness of nationalism&#8217;s limits. Forced 
        by the demands of national leadership to periodically relinquish his deeply 
        internalised view of Australian nationalism, in which &#8216;Britishness&#8217; 
        and &#8216;Australianness&#8217; were irreconcilable, Keating came to 
        express a more moderate, inclusive concept of &#8216;nation&#8217;.</p>
      <p>As I have argued in <em>The Power of Speech</em>, the idea that Australians 
        have never been an overtly nationalistic people is only half-right. For 
        much of last century, there was simply no need for Australians to craft 
        their own unique national myth, because the myth of Britishness fulfilled 
        so much of their cultural and emotional needs. Australians were once fervently 
        patriotic &#8211; for the British race. Australians did once define themselves 
        as &#8216;ancient&#8217; and &#8216;unique&#8217; &#8211; but also as 
        valued members of an indissoluble worldwide community of British peoples. 
        The implosion of this idea sometimes left Australian leaders confused 
        and confounded. Almost overnight they saw their identity fade &#8216;into 
        the mists&#8217; and then they &#8216;stumbled&#8217; into a multicultural 
        era, leaving their own history behind and instead imposing on the past 
        a new but ultimately artificial story &#8211; that Australia had been 
        multicultural since the beginning. Only gradually did they come to recognise 
        that it was the British institutional heritage &#8211; adapted by Australians 
        to suit their own circumstances &#8211; that provided the framework within 
        which a tolerance of diversity could thrive.</p>
      <p>The ongoing confusion about the content and context of an Australian 
        nationalism is very much a product of this transitional era. The slogan 
        adopted for the Centenary of Federation in 2001&#8211; &#8216;Australia: 
        it&#8217;s what we make it&#8217; &#8211; did not call forth a shared 
        Australian experience nor did it evoke any specific values or ideals that 
        might shape the life of the Commonwealth in its second political century. 
        It showed that the dismissal of the British heritage in all its forms 
        denied the very values and traditions which help to shape a sense of political 
        community and social cohesion. </p>
      <p>Doubtless the argument about the national self-image will continue. But 
        Australian prime ministers have, for the most part, resisted the lure 
        of nationalism. Not for them the purple prose of the Oval office. Not 
        for them providentialist missions about manifest destiny. Australia presents 
        a unique case study for scholars of nationalism. At Federation it created 
        a nation but remained firmly ensconced within the empire, but when that 
        empire and its myth faded Australians did not call forth their own exclusive 
        nationalism to fill the void. Instead they quickly shuffled their Britishness 
        to one side and embraced diversity. In this transition lies the source 
        of so much of the ongoing angst about the nation&#8217;s identity. My 
        expectation is that the emotional muddle and the rhetorical dilemma will 
        continue for some time to come. <br>
