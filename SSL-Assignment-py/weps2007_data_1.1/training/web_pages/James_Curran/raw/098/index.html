<H1>Teaching</H1>
<BR>
I am not currently involved in any tutoring of CS at Edinburgh, but I
intend to get involved in the coming term, after my PhD project has started
to take shape.
This page describes the courses I have previously tutored/demonstrated/marked
in the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of Sydney, Australia.

<H2>1901 Introductory Programming (Advanced) (February 1999, February 2000)</H2>
<P>
The IP course introduces programming concepts and some formal computer science.
The teaching language Blue (first developed at Basser) has been used for the past
few years to introduce 1st year students to programming and simple object-oriented
design.  Blue is a simple
object-oriented language with many similarities to Eiffel.  It supports a single
inheritance hierarchy, simple templates and comes complete with a useful standard
library of classes and collection templates.  IP is also interesting because the
course structure is based around the Problem-Based learning (PBL) paradigm, in
which the learning is driven by carefully chosen projects which last about 1/2
a semester, and are worked on in groups.  There is much more emphasis on laboratory
and tutorial time than lectures.  1 lecture per week, 1 tutorial hour and 3 laboratory
hours.  The tutorials and labs are taken by the same tutor.  In the past couple
of years this major project has been some form of simulation.
There is a significant focus on personal and group organisation, planning and communication.
Programming by contract is introduced.

<H2>1902 Introductory Computer Science (Advanced) (July 1999)</H2>
<P>
The ICS course takes off where IP finished and is also based on PBL.
The advanced version of the course moves from Blue to Java in the first couple of weeks.
The course gives further programming experience, expands on object-oriented design,
introduces some more formal concepts such as big-O notation and recursive descent parsing.
The course is based around a single project, which is an information management system
which must support a query language parsed using a recursive descent parser.
There are also a number of other activities in the tutorial, which involve other
aspects of design and algorithm analysis.  I have also marked several questions of the ICS exam.

<H2>2004/2904 Programming Practice in Unix (July 1999)</H2>
<P>
This course introduces C/C++ to students who already have a background in
Java (from the Design and Datastructures course in the February semester).
It also introduces some Unix programming tools, such as make, lex and yacc.
In 1999, it was taught by my Honours supervisor, Dr. Raymond Wong, and as
a result I became heavily involved with the course syllabus and assessment
tasks, as well as tutoring and marking.  In that particular year, the syllabus
was extended to include learning to use external libraries (a persistent objects
database library) and learning to use Unix sockets.  I marked the much of the exam
for this course.
</P>

<H2>3006/3906 Declarative Programming Languages (February 2000)</H2>
<P>
This course introduces declarative programming with half a semester each
of Prolog and Scheme (a variant of Lisp).  This can be a rather difficult
course to take after 2 years of procedural and object-oriented programming.
Once again, this course was taught by Dr. Wong, and I was again heavily
involved with the syllabus and assessment.  I set the exam marking scheme
and marked the exam as well as taking tutorials.
</P>

<H2>Other activities</H2>
<P>
I have also done extra marking for other courses including exam and
assignment marking for Object-Oriented Programming (C++ and OO methodology),
Design and Datastructures and Personal Database Tools.  I have also
I have also worked on the helpdesk which covers course, assignment and system
administration problems for students.
