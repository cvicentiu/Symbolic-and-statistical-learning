          <h3>INTERNET SEXUALITY: PLEASURE or PATHOLOGY?</h3>
<h2>by Alvin Cooper, Ph. D., Coralie R. Scherer, Ph.D.,<br>
Sylvain C. Boies, Ph.D. and Barry L. Gordon, Ph.D.</h2>
</center>


<p>While approximately 15 percent of the 57 million Americans
logging onto the Internet visit sexually oriented sites without any negative
impact, these sites do pose risks for some people.  Those individuals who
spend large amounts of time on the Net in sexual pursuits may be at risk for
developing psychological difficulties, such as sexual compulsivity,
according to new study in the April issue of Professional Psychology:
Research and Practice, a journal published by the American Psychological
Association.

<p>While it is clear that large numbers of Americans use the Internet for
sexual pursuits - previous studies suggest that 'sex' is the number one
searched word on-line - this survey-based study sought to determine who was
using the Internet for sexual pursuits, where they were going on the Net,
what they were doing there, and how it was affecting their lives.

<p>The study found that although on-line sexuality appears to be a form of
sexual exploration or recreation without negative consequences for most
people, those who spend 11 hours or more time on line in sexual pursuits
show signs of psychological distress and admit that their behavior
interferes with some areas of their lives. Time spent on line for sexual
pursuits may be an indicator of other problems that exist in users' lives,
or may even create further dependence, according to the study's authors.

<p>The study, a 59-item questionnaire, was conducted over a 7-week period
during March and April of last year.  The questionnaire was posted on the
MSNBC Web site and was completed by 13,529 individuals.  After discarding
surveys which were incomplete or filled out by people under 18 years of age,
a final simple of 9,177 respondents (all anonymous) was evaluated.

<p>According to the study, men are the largest consumers of sexually
explicit material on the Internet.  Male respondents (86%) outnumbered
female respondents (14%) by a ratio of 6:1.  Women, however, favor the use
of chat rooms, which offer more interaction and the development of
relationships (49% females to 23% males) to visual erotica (50% males to 23%
females).  Most individuals reported that they go on line for sexual
pursuits from home (78.8%); 5.8 percent admitted using an office computer;
and 12.7 percent  said they do both.  In addition, most individuals (64%)
were either married (47%) or in a committed relationship (17%), and, of the
single individuals (36%), half were dating and half were not.

<p>Time spent on line for sexual pursuits was a strong predictor of both
sexual compulsivity and distress.  Although, on-line sexual compulsivity is
a relatively rare condition, eight percent of the survey respondents were
found to be most at risk to develop serious problems from their heavy
Internet use.  This estimates compares to the estimated five percent of the
general population who deal with issues of sexual compulsivity.   The
majority surveyed (92%) spend under 11 hours a week in on-line sexual
pursuits, and half spend less than 1 hour a week for on-line sexually
related activities.  Most people appear to use sexual material on the
Internet as a source of entertainment more than for sexual release and
reported that on-line experiences were satisfying but not particularly
arousing.

<p>Honesty on the Net and regarding Internet sex activities does seem to
suffer.  Most respondents, 61 percent, reported occasional &quot;pretending&quot;
about their age while on the net.   Thirty-eight percent admitted presenting
themselves as a race different than their own.  Additionally, three out of
four respondents indicated keeping secret from others how much time they
spend on line for sexual pursuits, although most (87%) reported that they
did not feel guilty or ashamed about the time they spent on line.

<p>&quot;This study provides the first step in understanding the common use of
the Internet and can help mental health professionals to develop guidelines
to prevent, diagnose, intervene and treat sexual compulsivity and related
disorders,&quot; according to its lead author, Dr. Alvin Cooper of the San Jose
Marital and Sexuality Centre.  &quot;In addition it may be useful in the
identification of other issues that may be going on in users' lives for
which they wish to escape by turning to their keyboards.&quot;
