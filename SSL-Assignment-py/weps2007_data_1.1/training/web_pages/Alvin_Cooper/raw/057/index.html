						The history of Citizens National Bank, Macomb,  Illinois, was written by J. Binnie Wolfe in 1990 for the bank&rsquo;s centennial anniversary.  Addendums have been included that address the history of the bank since 1990.</b></font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The

					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="jbportrait_sm.jpg" border=1 align=left
width=68 height=100> John Binnie (see photo), the founder of the Citizens Bank 
						of Macomb, was born in Falkirk, Scotland, in 1845 in a 
						stone house which had a small iron gate with the insignia 
						in iron (Standa Lane, which means end of the lane). His 
						father, Andrew Binnie and his mother, Agnes Waddell, had 
						seven children, five of whom survived. In 1849 Andrew 
						Binnie decided he and his family should move to America. 
						They came by sailing vessel from Glasgow, Scotland, June 
						5, 1849, and arrived in New York one month later. They 
						then traveled by boat up the Hudson River, across the 
						Erie Canal and the Great Lakes, then down the Ohio River, 
						and finally up the Illinois River to Sharp's Landing near 
						Astoria, Illinois. In a short time they traveled overland 
						to Scotland Township, McDonough County, where they established 
						their home. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Andrew 
						Binnie passed away during the severe winter six years 
						later, leaving his twin sons, John and Robert, 15 years 
						old, a younger son, James, and a daughter, Annie (who 
						later married John F. Watson), for the widow to raise 
						and look after. The family was well educated for the times, 
						but just how they all survived and got along is hard to 
						imagine. We know the mother passed away when she was 66 
						years old. In the meantime, John and Robert formed a partnership 
						to buy and sell livestock, which must have been quite 
						successful. Robert purchased a farm in 1866 and the following 
						year John purchased another farm. He had to pay for it 
						in five installments, with the first due January 15, 1868, 
						in the amount of $3,500; the second due June 6, 1868, 
						in the amount of $4,000; the third installment of $2,000 
						was due January 1, 1869; the fourth of $2,000 was due 
						January 1, 1870; and the final installment of $3,700 was 
						due on January 1, 1871, for a total of $15,200. The farm 
						consisted of 320 acres due east of Macomb, known as the 
						East Farm, now held in the name of John Binnie Wolfe, 
						a grandson. Mr. John Binnie was attracted to the farm 
						because it was rolling, allowing the land to dry quicker 
						after a rain, and also because it was six miles east of 
						Macomb. </font> </p>
					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="mrs_jb_sm.jpg" align=right border=1 width=56
height=107> John Binnie at the time was 18 years old, and he was attracted to 
						the girl who lived at an adjoining farm. He always stopped 
						by her place to have Effie Savage (see photo) tie his 
						tie properly before he called on anyone he wished to impress. 
						On one evening Effie Savage suggested that he would save 
						a little time by calling on her, and she told him he would 
						have as much fun. As a result, he married her. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During 
						the years Mr. and Mrs. John Binnie were blessed with two 
						daughters, Eleanor and Eunice. Still later a son, Otho, 
						was born he was a handsome young man, but died of perontinitis 
						at the age of 19. </font> </p>
					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="jbinnie_sm.jpg" align=left width=72 border=1
height=145 alt="Photo of John Binnie"> John Binnie (see photo) was a vigorous 
						man standing six feet tall with broad shoulders and a 
						weight of 190 pounds. He was able to walk through snow 
						drifts when snow was so deep that horses could not travel 
						the country roads. He would walk across the fences on 
						the way to Macomb, which incidentally was approximately 
						six miles from his home. He was elected Tax Assessor of 
						Scotland Township for at least one year. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1889, John Binnie decided to build the bank building in 
						Macomb. The square was not, at that time, paved; but the 
						Courthouse was eight years old, and the population of 
						Macomb was 4,052. In 1890, John Binnie and his family 
						moved to 521 North Lafayette Street in Macomb. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
						Binnie brothers' bank was operated as a private bank without 
						any supervision or regulation of any kind from 1890 to 
						1920. Early in the first year, Robert Binnie decided that 
						he could make as much money farming, and he sold his stock 
						to Elmer T. Walker, the cashier. The story is told that 
						Robert Binnie did not like to wear a necktie, which was 
						required when the officers met to discuss the loans, and 
						that was the real reason for his decision. </font> </p>
					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="jasb_sm.jpg" border=1 alt="Photo of James Binnie"
align=left width=60 height=103> <img src="etwalker_sm.jpg" border=1 align=left
width=56 height=102> John Binnie and James Binnie (see photos) discussed all the 
						loans along with Elmer T. Walker, Cashier (see photo). 
						James Binnie was Vice President of the bank and was one 
						of the original stockholders. He was a veteran of the 
						Civil War and was also an active farmer. His wealth of 
						experience was a constant source of assistance to the 
						bank. He was the grandfather of Dorothy Allen. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1907, Edward C. Wolfe, husband of Eleanor Binnie and father 
						of J. B. Wolfe, who had been born and raised on a farm 
						of 360 acres just south of Walnut Grove, Illinois, and 
						had attended Butler University, decided he would like 
						to be a banker. In 1913, Lawrence Fisher, husband of Eunice 
						Binnie and father of John Fisher, who had graduated from 
						St. John's Military Academy, decided he wanted to be a 
						banker as the Fisher Foundry was closing. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1920, the State of Illinois passed the legislation stating 
						the banks had the privilege of being a state bank or joining 
						the national banking system. The Citizens State Bank of 
						Macomb was organized with John Binnie as President; Lawrence 
						Fisher as Vice President; Elmer T. Walker, Cashier; and 
						Edward C. Wolfe, Assistant Cashier. All of these men were 
						veteran bankers with 21, 7, 21, and 13 years of banking 
						experience. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
						ladies of the family decided that John Binnie should wear 
						a better looking hat to work. They were quite surprised 
						how quickly he acquiesced to their suggestion. Quite some 
						time later they found out that he always went through 
						the horse barn at the back of the house on his way to 
						work where he deposited the new hat on a peg and took 
						his old, comfortable hat and put it on his head and walked 
						on through to the alley, which was a shorter route to 
						town. When he returned he would walk in the same places, 
						go through the barn, exchange hats, and walk into the 
						house; and everybody was satisfied. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1927, John Binnie died. Then later in the same year, James 
						Binnie also passed away. Mrs. John Binnie was elected 
						Chairman of the Board; E. T. Walker was elected President; 
						Lawrence Fisher, Vice President; E. C. Wolfe, Cashier; 
						Mable Edie, Assistant Cashier. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1929 to 1930, the stock market crash caught the bank in 
						the midst of a remodeling program. It included a new stone 
						front; a new vault and vault door; and low walnut teller 
						window fixtures, the first in this area without bars or 
						cages. Deposits declined, but these improvements plus 
						an extension to the rear of the bank were completed on 
						schedule. Unquestionably, the improvements of the bank 
						did help to make the bank more accessible and helped to 
						keep it going. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After 
						President Roosevelt declared the nation-wide bank moratorium 
						in 1933, the Citizens Bank was allowed to re-open its 
						doors the first day designated for outlying country banks. 
						However, the large city banks of New York and Chicago 
						had received their authority to re-open the previous day. 
						</font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1936, J. Binnie Wolfe decided he would like to be a banker, 
						after graduating from Knox College and entering Northwestern 
						Business University and gaining experience as Assistant 
						F.D.I.C. Bank Examiner. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1939, a national charter was applied for and was granted. 
						This action was prompted by banking laws and the elimination 
						of duplication by both the state and federal agencies. 
						At that time the total assets of the bank were just under 
						$1,000,000. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Edward 
						C. Wolfe passed away in 1942, and J. B. Wolfe was elected 
						as Cashier of the bank. <img src="war_sm.jpg" alt="War Bonds" border=1 align=left
width=46 height=70> During World War II when the U. S. Army troops were stationed 
						at Camp Ellis, 23 miles east of Macomb, the Citizens National 
						Bank cooperated with the Army by establishing a banking 
						facility. Mr. John Fisher, who formerly was a practicing 
						attorney but also had previous banking experience, was 
						placed in charge of the facility. He had previously been 
						turned down by the armed services because of a physical 
						impairment. Camp Ellis was operated by the Army for training 
						purposes. The number of men assigned there varied from 
						50,000 to over 60,000. The facility opened July, 1943, 
						and was in constant use until October 1, 1945. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During 
						the World War, the bank officers formally were reduced 
						to three men in charge, Elmer Walker, J. B. Wolfe, and 
						John Fisher. The remainder of the people who helped us 
						were young ladies whose husbands had been drafted and 
						were in the service of the U. S. Government. They were 
						quite efficient in their work and to recall some of them 
						were Mable Edie, Thelma Farr, Kathryn Gaddis, Lucille 
						Cox, Shirley Woolam, Nancy Dobey, Dorothy Spicer, Barbara 
						Markley, Marilyn McDaniel, Elizabeth Hall, Pauline Rigg, 
						Ella Bugg, Wanda Miller, Dorothy Rigg, Pauline Newell, 
						Alza Blakely, Barbara Brown, Carol Henkle, Doris Trone, 
						Lorraine Rockhold, and Maney Dunbar. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1946, Captain Al Cooper returned from the Army and later 
						on that same year, so did Clarence Leighty and Morris 
						Arnold, former employees. John Fisher decided to stay 
						in the banking business because deposits had grown and 
						earnings had improved. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
						installment loan department was established in 1946 to 
						finance customer purchases of automobiles, farm machinery, 
						household appliances, and so forth. In the following year 
						microfilming of all important bank records was inaugurated, 
						followed by the installation of a central air conditioning 
						system. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. 
						Lawrence Fisher, Vice President, died in 1948. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1951 to 1952, under the direction of Elmer T. Walker, 
						Chairman; J. B. Wolfe, President; John Fisher, Vice President; 
						Alvin Cooper, Cashier; Clarence Leighty, Assistant Cashier, 
						the bank was completely redecorated and remodeled. New 
						blond mahogany teller windows were installed, and the 
						bank was extended back to Washington Street, where a combination 
						drive-up, walk-up teller window was placed in operation 
						for the convenience of our customers. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1954, at the suggestion of Fred Herndon, the friendly 
						bank slogan was adopted. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1955 the Farm Department was set up under the direction 
						of Raleigh J. Solomon to serve the farming interests of 
						the area and to accommodate the farm loan and farm management 
						field. R. J. Solomon had formerly been with the Production 
						Credit Association and later was in charge of the farm 
						loan department of McDonough and Henderson County. </font>					  </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1955, Elmer T. Walker died, and Mrs. Eleanor B. Wolfe, 
						daughter of John Binnie, was elected Chairman of the Board. 
						From 1930 to 1955, the officers of the bank kept the par 
						value per share at $100, which made $100,000 and the total 
						assets were $7,300,000. However, in 1960 as a result of 
						the increased business, they authorized a stock split 
						of 100%, which made the stock $200,000 and then added 
						to by selling an additional 100 shares to the public making 
						the total value $300,000. </font> </p>
					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="60out_sm.jpg" align=right border=1 alt="1960s
exterior of CNB" width=104 height=75>In 1960 to keep pace with the steady growth, 
						the entire front section of the bank was remodeled. Al 
						Cooper was largely in charge of the final plans, along 
						with the help of the Bank Building Corporation of St. 
						Louis. An open house was held July 6, 1961 with over 3,000 
						guests to personally inspect the red brick front, the 
						spacious lobby with its 10 teller windows, and separate 
						consulting rooms for officers. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
						Trust Department was organized in January of 1963, with 
						Clarence Leighty designated as Trust officer. To provide 
						for further expansion in 1964, the bank acquired the corner 
						property to the east which formerly housed the A &amp; 
						P Grocery. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1965, a 20% stock dividend was declared increasing the 
						total stock to $360,000. <img src="drup_sm.jpg" alt="Drive-up bank" align=left
border=1 width=96 height=49> In the latter part of 1965, the back part of the 
						corner property building was demolished and a new motor 
						bank was constructed at the corner of Randolph and Washington 
						Streets, which consisted of four drive-through windows 
						and one glass-enclosed walk-up window. The plan for this 
						building was largely designed by Al Cooper along with 
						the Bank Building Company of St. Louis. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						the latter part of 1965, Eleanor B. Wolfe, Chairman of 
						the Board passed away at 83 years of age. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1966 all checking accounts were placed on a data processing 
						system at the Commercial National Bank of Peoria. In the 
						future the bank would find many more uses for the computer 
						in other departments. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> John 
						Fisher, Vice President, died in 1967. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
						1968, a 16 2/3% dividend was declared increasing the capital 
						to $420,000. The bank did make a steady and continuous 
						growth with total assets currently amounting to $15,000,000. 
						A staff of 40 persons, including 12 officers were employed 
						in the various departments of the bank. The officers at 
						that time were J. B. Wolfe, President and Chairman of 
						the Board; Alvin R. Cooper, Senior Vice President; R. 
						J. Solomon, Vice President and Farm Department Manager; 
						Clarence Leighty, Vice President and Trust Officer; David 
						Carson, Vice President; R. N. Shult, Auditor; M. L. France, 
						Assistant Vice President; James B. Schisler, Cashier; 
						Harold Summey, Assistant Cashier; Calvin C. Spencer, Assistant 
						Cashier and Assistant Farm Department Manager; K. W. Wyatt, 
						Assistant Cashier and Assistant Farm Department Manager. 
						Directors were A. R. Cooper, T. Mac Downing, Frank J. 
						Horn, C. L. Leighty, J. Dixson McRaven, Keith F. Scott, 
						R. J. Solomon, James M. Trapp, Randall W. Watson, and 
						J. B. Wolfe. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
						bank, as a result of the supervisory service decided to 
						sell some additional debentures. These debentures could 
						be included as stock at the time; and we, therefore, avoided 
						selling additional bank stock. So on April 3, 1970, we 
						sold 250,000 shares, consisting of $29,000 to mature December 
						31, 1975, at 7%, $35,000 to mature December 31, 1977, 
						at 7.5%, $186,000 to mature December 31, 1980, at 8%. 
						In addition, we sold $420,000 on July 1, 1972, to mature 
						on December 31, 1979, at 7%. However, such procedures 
						are not now allowed under the improved banking laws of 
						the country. But as a result of this action, the bank 
						did increase the amount of capital assets to $2,140,000. 
						</font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At 
						this time Macomb and our own employees were having parking 
						problems. To relieve the situation Al Cooper contacted 
						the owner of the vacant lot across the street back of 
						the bank on Washington Street and was able to strike a 
						bargain. In doing so he also found that our own director, 
						Senator T. Mac Downing owned the two adjacent lots to 
						the west of the one we had already purchased. In addition, 
						he found that Mr. Downing also owned both of the lots 
						back of the lots on Washington Street on Jefferson Street 
						plus a property to the east on the corner of Jefferson 
						Street. The bank immediately drew up an agreement to purchase 
						the above listed properties owned by Mr. Downing as soon 
						as possible. This action gave more room and also helped 
						the city as much as it did our own customers. </font>					  </p>
					  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="s_sm.jpg" alt="View from South" align=right border=1
width=84 height=47> A year later the bank decided to enlarge the bank building 
						back to Washington Street. In doing so it had to purchase 
						additional space for this purpose. We purchased all of 
						the properties located on the north end of Jefferson Street 
						including the W. C. Miner property plus the properties 
						located along the street all the way to South Lafayette 
						Street, with the exception of the Industry Fire Insurance 
						Company. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A 
						new drive-thru facility was built with six drive-thru 
						stations and one walk-up station, plus a night deposit. 
						The building was located on the center of the property 
						with a parking lot on either end. The traffic and the 
						business has been good and the bank is quite pleased to 
						have additional parking available. </font> </p>
					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. 
						Richard H. Severs, the President of Farm King, was placed 
						on the Board of Directors in 1973, where he served for 
						12 years and then because of increased business, he asked 
						to be relieved of his duties as Director of the bank.

align=left width=60 height=88> In 1973, J. B. Wolfe (see photo), who had been 
						President for 22 years, turned the position over to Alvin 
						R. Cooper, who had an excellent background in banking 
						and many years of experience. He was well-liked by both

					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In

                        and software systems. A decision was made in the first

                        systems and installed an IBM AS 400 computer and software 
                        from Jack Henry Associates. This move resulted in significant 
                        costs but the Board was committed to take all necessary 
                        steps to ensure the bank's ability to continue to provide 
                        efficient and quality financial services. A decision was 
                        made later in 1997 to replace the bank's on-line teller 
                        system, the Customer Service Platform system and the Load

					  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As

						between the bank and the insurance agency and on September 
						1, 1997, the Roseville Hometown Insurance Agency was purchased 
						and moved into the bank lobby in the Roseville Office. 
						The owner of the agency joined Citizens and became the 
						manager of the agency, known as the Citizens Hometown 
						Insurance Agency. The bank added a customer service representative 
						to work in the agency and also added a new sales representative

                        the bank to acquire an Internet Banking product called 
                        NetTeller. The bank acquired the NetTeller system and 
                        put it into a test mode in September 1998. The product 
                        was made available to customers in the fourth quarter 
                        of 1998. Plans immediately got underway to include a bill-payer 
                        service as part of the Internet banking product and the 
                        bill-payer product was scheduled to be offered in the

<br>
After the 1999 acquisitions the bank continued with its plan to further define its market area and a decision was made to sell the Mt. Pulaski office early in 2001. The closing date of the sale was in the third quarter of 2001. <br>
<br>
A larger building had been purchased in Bunker Hill in 1999 and it was completely remodeled with the addition of two drive-up lanes as well as a drive-up ATM. A new vault was constructed which allowed the installation of safety deposit boxes for customer use. The grand opening of the new Bunker Hill office was held in June 2000. <br>
<br>
Improvements were made in the fall of 2000 at the Galva office, and they included a drive-up ATM and a drive-up window for customer banking services. In addition safety deposit boxes were installed to add that convenience to the Galva office customers. <br>
<br>
The Carlinville office was remodeled in 2004 by adding three offices and redecorating the lobby. The additional space was used for lending and insurance products and services. New CSR and customer reception areas were part of the remodeling project and a drive-up ATM was also installed next to the existing drive-in units. <br>
<br>
Members of the senior management team in 2000 included President and CEO T C Flemming, Executive Vice President J B Schisler and Senior Vice Presidents G B Grimm, K A Pico, and Todd Lester, who had joined the senior management team in late 1999. In its continuing emphasis to expand non-financial banking services including brokerage and trust, G W Turner was appointed First Vice President in late 2004 and he joined the senior management team as head of the bank's brokerage and trust departments. <br>
<br>
During the years from 1999 to 2004 the bank had grown in total assets to approximately $220 million. Net outstanding loans had increased to over $140 million. Total capital had increased to over $22 million by the end of 2004 from $15.1 million in 1999. <br>
<br>
The board of directors on December 31, 2004 included Chairman of the Board Mary E Satter and directors T C Flemming, J G Satter, P J Burke, J K Dively, N L Foster, W C Gossett, J D McRaven, J B Schisler and R W Watson. <br>
<br>
The bank began an expansion in 2000 to broaden its base of insurance and investment services by acquiring three insurance agencies. Two were located in Lewistown, Illinois, and one in Macomb. A professional insurance agency manager was brought into the agency in 2000. <br>
One of the bank's next goals was to establish a presence in Rushville, Illinois, and a de novo insurance agency office was established there in 2001. By the end of 2003, the annualized written premium had increased to nearly $3.5 million, more than triple the level in 2000. <br>
 
<br>
The bank established a de novo insurance agency in the Carlinville banking office on January 1, 2004. In July 2004, the bank acquired an agency in Rushville and merged the two Rushville offices into a single office location. <br>
<br>
At the end of 2004 the bank had six Illinois banking locations in Macomb, Roseville, Galva, Carlinville, Bunker Hill and Staunton. Investment and trust services were available in each office in addition to the traditional deposit and lending services. <br>
<br>
At this time, Citizens was offering insurance services at the Macomb, Roseville, and Carlinville banking offices and also had insurance agency offices in the communities of Lewistown and Rushville. The staff of the insurance center at year-end included the manager, five insurance producers, five CSRs and one employee in operations. Through internal growth and agency acquisitions, total annualized premium written exceeded $5 million by early 2005. <br>
<br>
The board of directors of Citizens Central Bancorp, Inc., of which the bank was a wholly owned subsidiary, determined in 2004 that in order to best serve its customers, shareholders and staff, various options should be identified and researched that would allow the bank to achieve its goals over the longer term basis. Realizing that it would require increased financial strength and a greater range of financial products in order to allow Citizens to continue its 115 year history of growth in providing quality and efficient financial services, the holding company board entered discussions in late 2004 with individuals whose objectives in providing community banking financial services were consistent with their own. <br>
<br>
After numerous discussions with several investor groups concerning the future of Citizens National Bank and comparing long term goals in providing quality financial services in a community banking environment, an agreement was reached on April 27, 2005, to sell the subsidiary bank to the JGS Investment Group located in Oak Brook, Illinois. The group, owned by Mr. John Gorman and Mr. Gary Svec , had previously acquired and managed several banks and had developed a consistent reputation for maintaining strong local community ties and relationships by working with existing staff and systems not only to maintain, but to increase those relationships and provide greater access to financial services and products. <br>
<br>
The transaction of the sale of the bank by Citizens Central Bancorp, Inc. to JGS Investments was scheduled for the first quarter of 2006 upon the ratification of the transaction by the shareholders of both parties and the receipt of the required regulatory approvals. <br>
<br>
The bank  purchased a new deposit and loan platform processing system early in 2005 and one of the benefits of the deposit system was the feature of an automated record keeping and tracking system for referrals for new business opportunities. Upon the installation of the new software in May, 2005, the bank immediately recognized the benefits of a fully automated referral system through a significant increase in successful referrals between the various departments of the bank including the brokerage, trust and insurance divisions of the bank. </font></p>

					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bank purchased a new accounting software system called  ProfitStar in the second quarter of 2005.&nbsp;  The software would be used to enhance the monthly balance sheet and  profit and loss reports, and later in the year, be used to prepare the monthly  board of director reports.&nbsp; The software  provided for increased efficiencies by allowing data to be automatically  downloaded from the bank&rsquo;s mainframe accounting system and this significantly  reduced the manual effort required to prepare the monthly and quarterly  reports.&nbsp; The system also provided  additional detailed reports on interest rates and interest margin analysis.</font></p>
                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later in the second quarter of 2005 the bank purchased a new  software package called &ldquo;Yellowhammer&rdquo; which was specially designed to identify  unique or unusual check or deposit transactions on certain deposit  accounts.&nbsp; The software was designed to  reduce fraudulent or unauthorized transactions that were occurring at an  increasing frequency.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It became obvious very soon that the new software would play  an important role in reducing fraud, and therefore losses, to both the bank and  its customers who had been targeted for fraudulent transactions by individuals  both in the United States and also several foreign countries.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A special shareholder&rsquo;s meeting was held July 22, 2005, for the purpose of  acting upon the recommendation of the board of directors to approve the sale  and merger agreement of April 27th.&nbsp;  All shares voted were in favor of the agreement.&nbsp; The date of the pending transaction was  tentatively set for the end of January 2006.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The board of directors and management spent much of the  remainder of 2005 working on the legal, regulatory and accounting aspects of  the transaction.&nbsp; In addition to the  December 31, 2005, year-end accounting requirements, additional preparation was  required in order to again close out the books on the date of the actual sale  and merger.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, on January   31, 2006, the sale and merger of Citizens National Bank was  consummated and a new board of directors was elected. </font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Retiring directors included outgoing Chairman of the Board Mary  E Satter, great-granddaughter of John Binnie.&nbsp;  As noted in the second page of this history, Mr Binnie was one of the  bank&rsquo;s founders in 1890.&nbsp; Other retiring  directors included John G Satter, President &amp; CEO Timothy C Flemming, and  Jon K Dively.&nbsp;  In addition, directors J Dixson McRaven  and Randall W Watson retired from the board, after serving on the board of  directors since January, 1961.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;The members of the  new board of directors elected January   31, 2006, were Bruce J Biagini, Patrick J Burke, Curtis C Farr,  Nancy L Foster, John E Gorman, William C Gossett, Todd V Lester, G Michael  Plaiss, Max R Rexroat, J B Schisler, Gary L Svec, and Gregory W Turner.&nbsp; Gary L Svec was elected Chairman of the Board  of Directors.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also on January 31,   2006, James B Schisler was appointed Chief Executive Officer and  Todd V Lester was appointed President and Chief Lending Officer of Citizens  National Bank.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the CEO and President, the Senior Management  Committee included Senior Vice Presidents Kent A Pico, Data Processing,&nbsp; Gene B Grimm, Branch Offices, and Gregory W  Turner of the Trust and Investment Financial Services Departments.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the second quarter of 2006 the bank was approached by  another bank in Galva indicating an interest in acquiring the assets and  liabilities of Citizens&rsquo; Galva office.&nbsp;  After careful consideration of the efficiencies of operating the Galva  office, a decision was made by the Board of Directors  in May to enter into an agreement to sell the office.&nbsp; Total deposits of the office were  approximately $6 million and there were a minimal number of loan transactions  at the office.&nbsp; The transaction included  the sale of the building and land where the office was located.&nbsp; The transaction was expected to be completed  in August, 2006, after receipt of the required regulatory approval and the coordination  of the accounting and conversion processes.</font></p>
					                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the bank entered the second half of 2006, the board of  directors and management were very pleased with the progress the bank has made  since January 31, 2006, in  both performance in earnings and growth in assets and liabilities.&nbsp; In addition, the bank has received very  positive customer feedback in the communities in which the bank had offices.  The bank continues to grow by increasing new business in loans and deposits and  also by expanding its activity in the trust, brokerage and insurance divisions.</font></p>
