<p>Destin Joseph Cooper, or “Joe,” as his friends called him, knew he didn’t feel quite right.<br><br>It was the summer of 2004, and he’d been spending less time at Quinley’s, his downtown Petaluma burger stand across from Walnut Park.<br><br>Though he didn’t yet know what was causing his illness, he felt it was time to step away from the business he had been running for more than four years. He and his brother, Alvin Cooper, decided not to renew their 10-year lease that was set to expire, and Quinley’s closed.<br><br>When the place was shuttered, it left a lot of unanswered questions in the minds of hungry patrons. Now, following the Nov. 15 death of his brother, Alvin Cooper wants to tell what took Joe away from the restaurant and the customers he loved.<br><br>“He was diagnosed about six months after the restaurant closed,” Alvin said this week, recounting his brother’s fight with colon cancer.<br><br>With a box full of Quinley’s memorabilia in hand — the brothers’ grandfather started the first Petaluma Quinley’s in 1945 — Alvin described his little brother Joe as a Petaluma-loving jack-of-all-trades who did everything from serving in the Air Force Reserves to delivering Clover milk to appraising real estate during his 41 years of life.<br><br>“He tried to do a lot for the community,” Alvin said. “If he wasn’t your milkman, he was the guy selling you burgers. He particularly liked to run the front counter because he was so friendly with people and liked talking with people.”<br><br>But Joe’s life took a sharp turn after learning about the cancer. Though he knew he was sick, sick enough to quit Quinley’s, the diagnosis confirmed the worst.<br><br>But Alvin said Joe didn’t want to make a big fuss over his illness.<br><br>“He was pretty private about it,” Alvin recalled. “He just wanted to live what normal life he could for the last little bit of his life. None of his customers really knew he was sick. It was just a family thing and he wanted it private that way.”<br><br>For the Coopers, family is a strong bond. The tiny stand on D Street where they served up one-third-pound burgers was opened by their maternal grandparents, Alvin and Faye Quinley, in 1952.<br><br>Back then it was the PDQ, advertising 19-cent hamburgers and using a milkshake mixer sold to Al Quinley by Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonalds. The PDQ was the Quinleys’ second Petaluma site. In 1945, after Al Quinley got out of the war, they opened a self-titled diner on Petaluma Boulevard South, across from where the Buckhorn bar is now.<br><br>It was considered to be the first drive-in in the North Bay, Alvin Cooper said. At one time, his grandparents had 16 restaurants, including what became Cattlemens in Petaluma and Santa Rosa.<br><br>They sold the Petaluma PDQ in 1959, though it lasted for another 30 years (Alvin Cooper said the “19-cent hamburgers” sign changed to “19-cent fries” and then “19-cent coffee” through the years).<br><br>From 1989-’94 it sat empty, until Alvin restarted it as part of a new six-store “Quinley’s” chain.<br><br>“My mom worked there as a kid,” he remembered. “She met my dad through that very window. So one day, when it looked like it was going to get torn down and bums were living behind it in 1994, I re-opened it.”<br><br>After running six restaurants for six years, Alvin realized he missed too much of his daughter’s early childhood. With his wife pregnant with their second girl, he decided it was time to get out of the restaurant management business.<br><br>He leased the six Quinley’s locations to other restaurants. Joe took on the Petaluma site.<br><br>“When I opened the Petaluma Quinley’s, the very first one, Joe was there. He ran the counter with me,” Alvin said. “And because he worked there, he really felt the sense of community when we were running it. The people we had grown up with would come in and buy our hamburgers.”<br><br>When it was time to find new management in 2000, “He came to me, because he knew I was letting them all go,” Alvin said.<br><br>For the next four years, Joe made Quinley’s his own. He lived on 12th Street and could walk to work, where often there were classic ’50s cruisers in the parking lot — that is, when there wasn’t a wooden dance floor set up for an old-time sock hop.<br><br>“You couldn’t even get out on the dance floor, it was so packed,” Alvin recalled. “On parade day, he would take the parking lot and put in a bunch of hay bales, like bleachers. And then one day he actually put in bleachers so that people right across from the post office could sit and watch the parade.”<br><br>When July 2004 came and the restaurant closed suddenly, “A lot of people wondered,” Alvin said. “Everybody wants to know why. Basically, he was feeling ill. He didn’t know that he had colon cancer, but he’d had it for at least three years. He probably had it the whole time he was running Quinley’s Drive-in.”<br><br>Despite his illness, Joe’s part of the franchise had outlasted all the others.<br><br>“Petaluma was the holdout,” Alvin said. “I was hoping the Petaluma Quinley’s would run on until I got ready to open up Santa Rosa again.”<br><br>He’s planning that now, just as the Petaluma location’s owners are planning on bringing in another ’50s-style drive-in. It won’t be named Quinley’s, but Alvin hopes Petalumans will still remember the name, and remember his brother.<br><br>“He fought for the country, he was the milkman, he was a real estate appraiser, he sold hamburgers, he was really involved with his high school reunion,” Alvin said. “He did a lot for the community and I think the community’s really going to miss him.”<br><br>(Contact Corey Young at <a href="mailto:cyoung@arguscourier.com">cyoung@arguscourier.com</a>)</p><br clear="all" />
