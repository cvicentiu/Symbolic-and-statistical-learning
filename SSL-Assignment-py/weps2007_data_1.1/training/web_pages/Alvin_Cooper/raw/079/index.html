Founder and Director of Project JAMAD (Jamaica-Madison Cultural Exchange)&#44; President of the Board of Directors of the Early Childhood Learning Center&#44; visiting professor&#44; lecturer&#44; educational consultant&#44; and activist as well as a generous and steadfast friend&#44; Dr. Cooper will be long remembered and deeply missed by his family&#44; friends and the many lives he touched. Born on Oct. 25&#44; 1935&#44; in Brunswick&#44; Ga.&#44; to Zachary and Mary (Rogers) Cooper&#44; Dr. Cooper was the first of eight children&#44; with five brothers and two sisters: David Cooper&#44; Alvin Cooper Whitaker&#44; James Whitaker&#44; Jerry Whitaker&#44; Jay Whitaker (deceased)&#44; Patricia Whitaker&#44; and Linda Whitaker. Dr. Cooper served in the U.S. Army for two years and was a member of the Medical Corps&#44; stationed in West Germany. After leaving the military&#44; Dr. Cooper settled in Madison&#44; attending the University of Wisconsin&#44; where he earned a bachelor of arts in European history&#44; a master of arts in American history&#44; and in 1979 earned his Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction. Dr. Cooper was an accomplished and published scholar&#44; devoting significant energy to researching and documenting the contributions of African-American families to the settlement and growth of Wisconsin&#44; creating teaching guides and tools and lecturing at schools and meetings throughout the state.

Dr. Cooper served on the Lancaster Area Chamber of Commerce and also hosted a weekly program on community television station WYOU and served on its Board of Directors. Dr. Cooper&#39;s greatest joy came in mentoring and teaching young people. Through his dedication to Project JAMAD&#44; a program that fosters self-esteem&#44; independence&#44; cultural awareness&#44; and learning&#44; Dr. Cooper was able to help provide an enriching and memorable travel experience for more than one-hundred Madison area youth.

He was born on Nov. 27&#44; 1958&#44; in Elkhorn&#44; to George Rohner and Betty Jane (Stickle) Hansen. Bill attended  Madison Memorial High School and Culver Military Academy&#44; Culver&#44; Ind. He was fluent in Spanish&#44; talented in mathematics&#44; played the alto saxophone&#44; and was a proficient disc jockey by the age of 16 years old. Bill loved music and singing. He also lived with a gentle funny kindness that not even his years of mental illness from schizophrenia could diminish. Bill was 6&#39; 11&#34; tall and a gentle giant of a man. He was a good brother&#44; and loving&#44; kind uncle. Bill was also a good friend to many and generous of spirit&#44; shared what he had with anyone who might be in need or whom he thought could be better off than he would be in having what was his. He was a butterfly and now is free from the frailty of his body and mind&#44; to be all he was not permitted by his health&#44; to be here in his short life. Bill was my beloved younger brother by 18 months and I can not recall life before him&#44; and certainly will feel the space his great heart took up&#44; now that he has gone on before me. I am grateful that in this life&#44; I was blessed to have him as an example of what a kind soul&#44; fair eye&#44; and gentle hand could be. I was also blessed that Bill inherited our mother&#39;s sense of fun and humor&#44; and even in his mental illness or poor health&#44; he found reasons to laugh and love&#44; often at himself&#44; and certainly at me. Bill was a real gift. He is survived by his sister&#44; H. Devon Hansen Chastain of Madison; a stepbrother&#44; Anthony Cassatt of New Orleans&#44; La.; a nephew&#44; Benjamin William Hansen Chastain; a niece&#44; Anna Colleen Elizabeth Chastain; and hermano&#44; Darwin Guevera and Veronica Vega&#44; and family. Bill was preceded in death by his parents&#44; who adored him from his long hard struggle into this world&#44; until they died; step-brothers&#44; Alexander Cassatt and Jacques Cassatt; and other family members. Memorial services will be held at GUNDERSON EAST FUNERAL HOME&#44; 5203 Monona Drive&#44; at 2 p.m. on Saturday&#44; Nov. 18&#44; 2006. In lieu of flowers&#44; please make donations in Bill&#39;s name to Madison&#44; Wisconsin&#39;s Homeless Shelters&#44; Dane County Mental Health Center&#44; or Chrysalis Inc.

Also&#44; especially to Darwin&#44; Vero&#44; Ingrid and Donna&#44; who exemplify what real friends are.
