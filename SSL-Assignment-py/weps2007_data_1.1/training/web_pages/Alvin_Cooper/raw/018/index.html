More than 20 years of sales and project management experience, a passion for real estate and a focus on total customer care are the foundation as Alvin Cooper carves his niche as the Realtor of Choice.
</p>
<p>
“With a strong service background, Alvin is a wise counselor who takes a long-term approach to his real estate business,” says Virginia Cook, chief executive officer and founding partner. “His goal is to build lasting customer relationships by delivering the highest level of satisfaction and expertise.”
</p>
<p>
Alvin has earned numerous sales achievement awards and a reputation as a problem solver who can implement change and make the tough business decisions.
</p>
<p>
Now these abilities work to the advantage of his clients. “Alvin truly represents grace under fire,” says Cece Case, vice president and manager of the Plano office of Virginia Cook, Realtors. “His keen business sense and calm, professional demeanor are valued by home buyers and sellers who are going through one of the biggest transactions in their lifetime.”
</p>
<p>
Alvin also brings financial knowledge, having earned his bachelor’s degree in accounting from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Throughout his career he has received advanced training in sales, marketing, customer service, project management and leadership.
</p>
<p>
“Every successful, lasting relationship starts with listening,” says Alvin, who has been a speaker for the National Alliance of Businessmen’s Youth Motivation Task Force and a Junior Achievement Advisor. “By taking a consultative approach, I help my clients and customers recognize their true needs and preferences so that we can achieve a satisfying transaction.”
</p>
<p>
Alvin says that he was drawn to Virginia Cook, Realtors by the professionalism and energy displayed companywide. 
</p>
<p>
“This is an environment that motivates and supports each of us in our drive for success,” he explains. “We really believe that when it comes to making customers happy, anything is possible.”
