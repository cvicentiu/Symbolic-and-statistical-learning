<p class='classAd'>Cooper&#44; Zachary L. <br>> MADISON - Zachary L. Cooper. died peacefully Wednesday&#44; Nov. 1&#44; 2006&#44; at the Ellen and Peter Johnson Hospice Care Residence&#44; at the age of 71. Dr. Cooper was a widely respected educator&#44; historian and local philosopher known for his intellect&#44; wit&#44; tenacity and his deep and abiding commitment to young people and his community. Founder and Director of Project JAMAD (Jamaica-Madison Cultural Exchange)&#44; President of the Board of Directors of the Early Childhood Learning Center&#44; visiting professor&#44; lecturer&#44; educational consultant&#44; and activist as well as a generous and steadfast friend&#44; Dr. Cooper will be long remembered and deeply missed by his family&#44; friends and the many lives he touched. Born on Oct. 25&#44; 1935&#44; in Brunswick&#44; Ga.&#44; to Zachary and Mary (Rogers) Cooper&#44; Dr. Cooper was the first of eight children&#44; with five brothers and two sisters: David Cooper&#44; Alvin Cooper Whitaker&#44; James Whitaker&#44; Jerry Whitaker&#44; Jay Whitaker (deceased)&#44; Patricia Whitaker&#44; and Linda Whitaker. Dr. Cooper served in the U.S. Army for two years and was a member of the Medical Corps&#44; stationed in West Germany. After leaving the military&#44; Dr. Cooper settled in Madison&#44; attending the University of Wisconsin&#44; where he earned a bachelor of arts in European history&#44; a master of arts in American history&#44; and in 1979 earned his Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction. Dr. Cooper was an accomplished and published scholar&#44; devoting significant energy to researching and documenting the contributions of African-American families to the settlement and growth of Wisconsin&#44; creating teaching guides and tools and lecturing at schools and meetings throughout the state. His video&#44; &#34;Coming Together&#44; Coming Apart&#34; used oral histories&#44; photos&#44; and diaries&#44; to preserve precious evidence of Wisconsin&#39;s historical heritage. Dr. Cooper authored &#34;Black Settlers in Rural Wisconsin&#34; as well as &#34;The Decade of Discontent&#44;&#34; documenting the Milwaukee racial turmoil of the 1960s. A wide variety of educational institutions called upon Dr. Cooper to share his expertise and his love of young learners&#44; including the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#44; Edgewood College&#44; Madison Area Technical College&#44; the Madison Public Schools&#44; and the Wisconsin Historical Society. At Oakwood Village&#44; he taught courses on African-American history and&#44; most recently&#44; met weekly to discuss current events and other matters of interest with a group of Oakwood residents who held a special place in his life. Dr. Cooper served on the Lancaster Area Chamber of Commerce and also hosted a weekly program on community television station WYOU and served on its Board of Directors. Dr. Cooper&#39;s greatest joy came in mentoring and teaching young people. Through his dedication to Project JAMAD&#44; a program that fosters self-esteem&#44; independence&#44; cultural awareness&#44; and learning&#44; Dr. Cooper was able to help provide an enriching and memorable travel experience for more than one-hundred Madison area youth. A memorial service to celebrate the life of Dr. Cooper and his legacy will be held on Saturday&#44; Nov. 18&#44; 2006&#44; at 4 p.m.&#44; at JAMES C. WRIGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL&#44; 1717 Fish Hatchery Road&#44; Madison. The family is deeply grateful and thankful for the wonderful care given to Dr. Cooper by the Hospice staff and other caregivers.
