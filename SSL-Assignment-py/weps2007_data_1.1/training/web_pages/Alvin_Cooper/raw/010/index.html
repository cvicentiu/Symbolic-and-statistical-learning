<span id="articlebody"><P>
<P>Destin Joseph Cooper Was born at Hillcrest Hospital in Petaluma, January 15, 1965 and died at 308-12th St., on November 15, 2006. He was surrounded by family. He is survived by his parents Ray and Dodie Cooper; his brothers Ray Allen Cooper, Jr. and Alvin Cooper (Jill); nieces, Eustacia and Tessa Cooper and nephew, Kevin Cooper. His grandmother, Faye Busalacchi predeceased him, March 6, 2006. Dusty was the principal caregiver for his grandmother with whom he shared a special bond. His paternal grandparents were Buck and Billie Cooper and he was a delight in their lives. His aunt, Kathy May and cousin Pam Glenn helped make his transition from hospital to home loving and caring. He leaves numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Joe's friends were primary in his life and none more loving and attentive than John Barragon, who was with him on this last year's journey every day of his illness. Wendy Taylor and Jon Raj made up the trio of strength and love that got him through this debilitating and painful cancer. From the time he was a child, he was compassionate and generous with everything he had, especially emotionally. He was used to being the first on the scene when there was trouble and would take control and make everyone's way easier. This time he had to accept the love and support that came back to him from his friends and family. He often remarked he couldn't get over John's devotion and love and he was grateful and gracious in accepting that love. Joe leaves many, many friends. He attended Petaluma schools and retains many friends from that period. Joe traveled extensively during his stint in the Air Force Reserve and later in life. He loved to travel and was planning trips two weeks ago. He even managed some trips this last year to Las Vegas, Tacoma, and Palm Springs. Joe did many things in his life from milkman, restaurateur, limo driver, etc until he finally settled into real estate and small developments, for which he had fine talent. His most lasting legacy was his loving heart and generous soul. The hope is that will sustain those who he leaves behind. We are all grateful for the time we shared. Friends and family are invited to attend the Funeral Service, Monday, November 20, 2006 at 10:30 AM at the PARENT-SORENSEN MORTUARY & CREMATORY, 850 Keokuk St., Petaluma, CA (707) 763-4131. A Visitation will be held Sunday, November 19, 2006 from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM at the Mortuary.
