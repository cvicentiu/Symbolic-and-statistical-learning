<h1>Unusual Sex Messages Are Commonplace In...</h1>
<p>The death of a woman police
say was told by
e-mail from a North Carolina man that he wanted to sexually torture
and kill her was the end result of a scenario that many sexual
abuse professionals say is commonplace in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Chat rooms on the Internet deal with almost every sexual
proclivity known to man. Sex abuse professionals say some women,
often abused as children, seek such abuse as adults. And Internet
chat rooms, like the ones Mrs. Lopatka frequented, while providing
a place to talk about their desires, also expose them to sexual
predators.</p>
<p>The body of Sharon Lopatka was found buried in the yard of a
Caldwell County, N.C., man who, according to court documents, had
corresponded with her via computer about plans to sexually torture
and kill her.</p>
<p>Dr. Alvin Cooper, director of the San Jose Marital and
Sexuality
Centre in California, and the author of a column on sexuality found
on the World Wide Web, said the Internet is attracting people with
a variety of fetishes to chat rooms. And, those chat rooms are
attracting sexual predators.</p>
<p>``There's something about the way communication on the 'Net
works that fosters a sense of intimacy, security, connection. You
really feel you know the person,'' Cooper said.</p>
<p>``There definitely are predators lurking around and sexual
predators who know these sites are going to pull in people with
specific sex interests. And again, you don't have any sense of
whether the person has any contact with reality or is really
totally out there,'' Cooper said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lopatka may have suffered from sexual masochism, said Fred
Berlin, founder of the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorder Clinic.</p>
<p>``We're not sure what causes it, but certainly in my clinical
experience, all the women who are having these masochist cravings
were themselves abused sexually during childhood,'' said Berlin.
``The feelings of sexual excitement can become confused with
abuse.''</p>
<p>Mrs. Lopatka, 35, of Hampstead, was found Friday strangled to
death near a mobile home owned by Robert Glass, who has been
charged with killing her.</p>
<p>Glass, a 45-year-old computer systems analyst who separated
from
his wife this spring, told investigators that Mrs. Lopatka may have
died during a sexual act in which a rope was tightened around her
neck during intercourse.</p>
<p>Investigators believe they met in a sexually oriented ``talk
group'' or ``chat room'' on the computer network.</p>
<p>Graphic e-mail messages found on Mrs. LoPatka's computer detail
how the person she corresponded with planned to sexually torture
and kill her, according to affidavits filed in the case.</p>
<p>Maryland State Police spokesman Mike McKelvin said it could
take
up to two weeks to investigate all of LoPatka's e-mail messages.</p>
<p>``Anywhere upwards of 100 messages were between her and Mr.
Glass... ranging from less than a half a page to full pages, so
there's a lot of work to do,'' McKelvin said.</p>
<p>``There were several messages where they were just talking to
each other. Maybe less than half of them had anything to do with
the crime,'' he said.</p>
<p>Internet use by women has increased dramatically in the past
two
years, said Bonnie Raindrop, co-owner of Doubleclick Publications,
an on-line publishing firm where Mrs. Lopatka posted three World
Wide Web pages for a business she ran from her home.</p>
<p>And many of those women, whose free time is consumed by work
and
family demands, are turning to the Internet as a social outlet, she
said.</p>
<p>``People will disclose some pretty intimate things on e-mail
and
feel safe about that, and it can progress to a point where normal
defenses are down,'' Ms. Raindrop said.</p>
<p>Cooper said the Internet can sometimes prevent people with
problems from getting help.</p>
<p>``It gives the person enough of a relief for their unhappiness
where they don't take any more progressive action, like seeing a
therapist,'' Cooper said. ``They don't say `I need help because I
feel like getting beat up.' They get onto these sites where people
say `That's fine, that's great.'''</p>
<p>Cases of women seeking abuse are not unusual, said Lynn
Reynolds, clinical director of The Institute Against Social
Violence in New York, a for-profit clinic that works with abusers
and victims.</p>
<p>Women who find themselves involved in abusive relationships
often are trying to address abuse suffered during childhood, she
said.</p>
<p>``This time as an adult she feels she can control what happens
to her. She might deny the extent of the danger, which sounds
amazing, but it's true,'' Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Lopatka's own motivations remain a mystery. Attempts to reach
her husband were unsuccessful. One neighbor in the rural area 25
miles northwest of Baltimore said the couple kept to themselves.</p>
