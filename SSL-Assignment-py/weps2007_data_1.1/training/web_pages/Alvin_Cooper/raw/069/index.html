                                  <p align="left"><span class="content">Born April 19, 1920, in Rockwood, he was the son of Adele Stone Bernard and Joe Bernard, both of whom preceded him in death. He attended public schools in Rockwood and was a member and president of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, where he was a member of the Owl Club, the Ace Club and lettered in baseball before graduating in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in economics. A World War II veteran of the U.S. Navy, he was promoted to lieutenant senior grade officer and participated in the invasion of North Africa and fought in the Pacific Theater, where his ship was engaged in the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. One of his proudest memories was being present when the American flag was raised on Mount Suribachi. He settled in Nashville after the war and began a career in the wine and spirits industry of Middle Tennessee by establishing B. and G. Wholesalers Inc. Recognized as one of the more influential promoters of the appreciation of fine wines in this region, he was a charter member of the Ete du Vin charity wine auction and was president of the Wine and Spirits Association of Tennessee for seven years. He enjoyed golf and fishing and was an avid spectator sports fan and longtime supporter of the Vanderbilt athletic program. He retired from the business in 1988 after suffering a major stroke, but maintained his wonderful spirit and remained a joy to his family and many friends. He will be best remembered for his love of people, his generosity, loyalty and good humor.<BR /><BR />In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by sister, Carolyn Bernard Greif; and brother, Jack Bernard.</span>
