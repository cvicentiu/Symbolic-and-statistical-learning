film about what it once meant to be American."</font></font></b>
<p><b>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</b>
<p><b>John Ford's epic Western about America and its racial past is the
quintessential American film about what it once meant to be American, more
than any other film that I could think of and that includes </b><i>Citizen
Kane</i><b>. It is Ford's best, one that is much more than the Western
it appears to be; it is a film that is about the self-discovery of a man's
love and hate and about his country's past racism, seen symbolically through
the eyes of one man, John Wayne. </b><i>The Searchers
</i><b>tells of the
perilous and obsessive 5-year quest to find 10-year-old Debbie, the niece
of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), who was abducted by a raiding Comanche party,
under Chief Scar (Brandon).</b>
<p><b>The embittered Ethan arrives home in 1868 after serving in the Confederacy.
He has been riding on his own for the last 3 years since the war is over,
probably supporting himself by robbing banks (He does not explain how he
got the bags of newly minted coin in his saddlebags). Ethan appears at
the isolated Texas ranch of his brother Aaron (Coy) and his wife Martha
(Jordan) and their three children--Ben (Lyden), Lucy (Pippa), and Debbie
(Lana), and the part-Cherokee (one-eighth) son they adopted, Martin Pawley
(Jeffrey Hunter), whose parents were slaughtered by Comanches and was found
by Ethan.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Ethan treats Martin with utter disdain, saying he could take him
for a half-breed, and refuses to have the child call him uncle. Soon after
Ethan's return, a raiding party under Chief Scar kills Aaron, Martha, and
Ben. When this happened a posse with Ethan and Martin among them, was out
looking for what they thought were rustlers. The Indians had abducted the
two little girls, Debbie and Lucy.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Ethan searches for the girls with Martin and Brad (Harry), the boyfriend
of Lucy. When Lucy is found dead by Ethan, Brad in a craze rushes off to
charge the Indians and is killed. Ethan pushes on relentlessly following
their trail, aiming to kill Debbie and her captor, Chief Scar, for violating
her--declaring that once a white girl is captured by Comanches, she is
no longer white. Martin goes along, so that he can prevent Ethan from doing
something vengeful.</b>
<p><b>It is a psychologically dark story of a man who is heroic but filled
with a bitterness that he can't get out of his system. There is not one
single actor in the world who could have played this part better than Wayne.
His lone odyssey is of a self-assured rugged individualist, filled with
racial hatred and love for his kin. It takes place in the beautifully photographed
vistas of Monument Valley, where cinematographer Winton Hoch caught the
mythic landscapes of the West, with its red earth and mesas, and all its
splendor and ominous passages and isolation.</b>
<p><b>Ford threw the whole panoply of Western gear into </b><i>The Searchers</i><b>.
There's</b><i> </i><b>the slapstick antics of Mose Harper (Worden), playing
the Shakesperian fool, leading Wayne to the trail of Debbie twice, only
asking in return to be taken home to sit by a fireplace in a rockin' chair;
there's also the garrulous Texas Ranger Captain/Reverend Clayton (Ward
Bond), who comically switches roles from gunfighter to man of peace without
batting an eyelash.</b>
<p><b>The two main questions John Wayne faces are: What to do with Debbie?
And, from the words in the Stan Jones ballad sung in the opening credits
that asks, "What makes a man wander and turn his back on home?" The second
question becomes, Will Wayne ever come home? In the opening scene, he is
only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay,
even when idolized by the children. In the last scene when he finds redemption
by not killing Debbie after he rescues her and raises her up in his arms,
reminded in that split-second of how he held her as a child and thereby
changes his mind and brings the 14-year-old home to his closest neighbors,
the Jorgensen's, to stay for good. But Wayne never crosses the doorway
to his home; his home is in the past, just as is Chief Scar's. It is a
past that goes no further than the wars fought and the hatred ingrained
in them. He will not go to California and will not advance civilization,
he represents the past that must be put asunder before others can move
on and turn the desert into farmland and ranches.</b>
<p><b>For Martin the quest will end in domesticity as he will marry Laurie
(Vera Miles), the daughter of the Jorgensen's. Wayne will be like the dead
Comanche he shot the two eyes out of, forced to travel the spirit land
forever, never finding a proper resting place.</b>
<p><b>Ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the Indians.
That he hates Indians so much yet speaks their language and feels comfortable
with their ways more so than he does with white society, makes it difficult
to figure why he has so much hatred for them.</b>
<p><b>Ethan's disdain for society and home life is evident in the brooding
figure he presented of himself when he first came home. Aaron is not as
pleased to see him as is his wife, who it is implied once loved Ethan before
she married. Ethan's generosity to the children is shown by the gifts he
gives them, a saber for Ben and his war medal to Debbie so that she can
have something to wear around her neck just like the gold pendant he gave
to Lucy when she was younger.</b>
<p><b>The John Wayne character is a complex one, wavering between his loves
and hates. His story is visceral poetry. It's a tragedy that turns ridiculous
as Ford wanted it to be. There are unexpected psychological twists that
can be read into the story by one's own relationship with America. It is
hard not to substitute Wayne's hatred for Indians into a hatred for blacks,
and it is easy to see how Wayne's soul could be construed as America's
soul.</b>
<p><b>Make no mistake, this is not an ordinary or very good Western, this
is undoubtedly a masterpiece of American cinema. It's one that many of
the early 1950s film critics couldn't see. It is not that it is a particularly
profound movie, but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors
of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future. Over
the years the status of this film has grown immeasurably, to the point
that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene, along
with the recognition that Ford has created a work that searches deeply
into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness. If there was
a more perceptive Western made, one that captured the visions of America
better, I have not seen such a film. If there is such a film out there,
I will take the liberty of using Wayne's favorite retort: "That'll be the
day."</b>
