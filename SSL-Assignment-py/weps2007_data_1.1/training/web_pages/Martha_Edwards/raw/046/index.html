<p><b><font size=-1>(3) Artemicia<sup>2</sup> O'Dell</font></b><font size=-1>,
(Bartlett<sup>1</sup>) was born about 1816 in TENNESSEE/VIRGINA, and on
28 Oct 1841 in Claiborne County, Tn, married <b>Spencer Edwards</b>, son
of <b><a href="http://friends.acmecity.com/decaf/297/edwards/pafg01.htm#9">William
Edwards and (Unk) Evart,</a></b> who was born about 1780. Artemicia died
in Jan 1901 in Claiborne County, Tn. Spencer died on 3 Nov 1848 in Claiborne
County, Tn. Spencer was married to Katherine "Katy" Riddle.</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: The name of this daughter of Bartlett O'DELL is
uncertain. Some records show her as "A.M." ODELL, some as "Artie", others
as "Artiemacey" or "Artemicia," still others as "Anta Masa." Her year of
birth had been calculated from various census records, etc. with consideration
for the recorded ages of her siblings. Because of conflicting data, the
date of her birth has fluctuated between 1816 and 1817. Page 64 of the
Lawrence EDWARDS, "OLD SPEEDWELL FAMILIES" reads "1817- Feb 28, 1901,"
and appear to have been taken from a tombstone. No reference was cited
for these dates. "Artiemacy EDWARDS" was enumerated in 1850 as the head
of her own household. Her age at that time was recorded as "33." Ten years
later, "Artamacy" was recorded on the census for Claiborne County twice!
Both entries appeared on page 240, but the first one is numbered #1519/#1519.
The second entry is at household and family number 1542. In the first entry,
Artamacy is reported to be 57 years of age; in the second entry, she is
"43". The other five individuals shown in these households are the same
as are the ages of each of them. The census for Claiborne Co., TN in 1870
shows "Artamecia's" age as 54 in August, 1870; the 1880 census for the
same County has recorded her age as "64." Calculation from these two records
would place her year of birth at about 1816. Using the 1850 and 1860 records
to calculate, her year of birth would be about 1817 -- not a wide difference
as compared to discrepancies in other family data from one census to another.
The index to probate reference dates Spencer EDWARDS' will 24 OCT 1848.
This entry lists the two wives of Spencer EDWARDS as well as the following
children: Rachel Sally James Sampson Martin Japatha (Jeptha) George Hiram
Joseph Spencer Lety (m.___Hays) Elizabeth (m.___Keck) Martha (m.___McKindry)
"John Keck and Levi Goins, executors" The actual date of death is not included
in this index.</font>
<p><font size=-1>March 1996; Compiler received a copy of "Reflections",
the quarterly newsletter of the Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc. It contained an
article on the ODELL family by Marjorie WALSH, a descendent of Marshall
L. ODELL. Per her data for Bartlett and Elizabeth ODELL, "Artimacey ODELL"
was born Feb. 1816. The source of this data was not cited. Spencer died
before the 1850 census and his widow was left with three of his children
by his first wife in addition to the four born to Artemicia. There are
unanswered questions about the data appearing in various sources concerning
this family. A child named Spencer EDWARDS appears as one year of age in
1850; in 1860 this youngster is 11 years of age. There is also an "Elizabeth"
whose age is given as "9" on the 1860 record. Seemingly her last name is
EDWARDS, but Spencer, Sr. could not have fathered this child. Of course,
in those two records, no "relationship to head of the household" is recorded,
so one or both of these children may have only been visiting in the EDWARDS
household. Jan. 1997: Compiler examined the 1870 census for Claiborne Co.,
TN. This record shows "Artamecia" as head of the household. The only others
enumerated in her household are 25-year-old Martha EDWARDS, and a newly
married couple, Daniel D. HOPPER and his bride, Elizabeth. Daniel's occupation
is listed as "Teaching School." The young wife's age is given as "15" and
they both report they were married in "Jan." of the census year. Per the
will index cited above, Elizabeth EDWARDS, the daughter of Spencer is reported
to have married a Mr. KECK. Compiler has not found the maiden name of Elizabeth
HOPPER, enumerated in this home in 1870 (as of Jan. 1997.) It is puzzling,
however, that the "Elizabeth" enumerated in the home in 1860 was 9 years
of age; the Elizabeth listed here as the newly- wed wife of Daniel D. HOPPER
is only 15 years old. It is likely that neither of these "Elizabeths" is
the daughter of Spencer EDWARDS. Compiler found "Henry KECK and his wife,
Elizabeth (EDWARDS) residing in Laurel County, KY in 1850. Notes included
in the annotated census compilation for that County indicate that they
were married in Claiborne County, TN in 1839. This would mean that Elizabeth,
if this is Spencer's daughter, would probably have been the first of Spencer's
children by Katy (RIDDLE) EDWARDS. Elizabeth (EDWARDS) KECK would have
been born about 1819. The identity of the "Elizabeth EDWARDS", age 9, or
the "Elizabeth HOPPER," age 15, on the two census records remains a mystery.
Sept. 1997, compiler visited Ben L. ODELL in Johnson City, TN. Ben, a descendant
of Artiemicia's brother, Marshall Love O'DELL, has provided compiler with
what appears to be a type-written transcript of information from a book
entitled, "CLAIBORNE COUNTY, TENNESSEE PENSIONERS." There are several typographical
errors in the excerpt, and at least two dates have been miscopied, as will
be evident to the reader.</font>

<p><font size=-1>Compiler's Note: The date of the marriage, as stated in
the last line above, would be one day after Spencer's death. Nov. 1997:
Eva (WELLS) McCARTY, a descendent of Artemicia's sister, Mary Pauline (O'DELL)
LAY, sent compiler a list of grave removals from a book by Edith WILSON
HUTTON. The data found there was copied from TVA records. Among the graves
listed were Catherine EDWARDS, probably "Katy" (RIDDLE) EDWARDS, Spencer's
first wife, two graves for "Spencer EDWARDS" (one with no dates, the other
with only a date of death "1848") and "Mrs. Spencer EDWARDS 1816-1901."
All of these graves had been moved from Big Barren Cemetery to Edwards
Cemetery in Claiborne County about 1935. Interestingly enough, all four
of these removals were authorized by "Spencer EDWARDS, Goin, TN." (Probably
the son or grandson of Spencer EDWARDS.) A fifth grave, that of William
EDWARDS, the father of Spencer, was also authorized by Spencer EDWARDS
of Goin, TN. Discovery of the cemetery removal records does document Artemicia's
year of birth as "1816."</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: Aug. 1995: Compiler found reference to Spencer's
Edwards' will in Probate Records Index. Per that entry, Spencer's will
was dated 24 OCT 1848. This would have been about 7 years after his marriage
to "Artie" O'DELL. The data given in this index follows: First Wife: Katy
Riddle Second Wife: Artamasa O'DELL Children: Rachel Hiram Sally Joseph
James Spencer Sampson Lety m.___Mays Martin Elizabeth m.___Keck Japatha(Jeptha)
Martha m.___McKindry George John Keck and Levi Goins, Executors</font>
<p><font size=-1>Considerable data on Spencer EDWARDS, his two wives and
children who eventually tied back into the O'DELL family, was taken from
Lawrence EDWARDS' book, "Old Speedwell Families" and the later revisions
of same. This source gives Spencer's birth and death dates as "1780-1860."
August 1996: Compiler researched the 1850 census film for Claiborne Co.,
TN. Per that film, Spencer was not in his household in October, 1850. There
was a one-year-old child bearing Spencer's name; "Artiemacy" was listed
as head of the home, and there were six children listed in addition to
young Spencer. Ages of those children ranged from 4 years to 18 years.
One household before Artiemacy was the home of Jeptha and Sarah M. EDWARDS.
Twenty-six-year-old Jeptha was one of Spencer's sons. The tombstone in
the EDWARDS Cemetery which bears Spencer's name has no dates. Compiler
believed that he died between 1848-1850, rather than 1860 as recorded by
Lawrence EDWARDS, but had not found documentation to prove this, until
Sept., 1997, when compiler was given copies of selected documents and research
notes belonging to Ben L. ODELL, Johnson City, TN. A photocopy of information
taken from "CLAIBORNE COUNTY, TENNESSEE PENSIONERS" states that Spencer
EDWARDS died "11-3-1848." The details of this source were not provided,
but probably was a book from the Claiborne County Library. (Compiler has
included the text of this photocopy in its entirety below.) A date for
Spencer's marriage to Katie RIDDLE has not been found. Compiler has estimated
their marriage to be about 1815, but this may be much too early. Their
oldest child seems to have been born about 1818, but sources do not agree
on the order of birth of the EDWARDS children. Spencer's will also lists
children who do not appear in any other source. It may be possible that
some named in the will were grandchildren. Compiler found a Spencer EDWARDS
of the right age on the 1830 census for Claiborne County. On the same film
there was a Hiram EDWARDS and a James EDWARDS in Claiborne County; all
three EDWARDS men were in the 30-40 age range. These may well be brothers
to Spencer. ****************************</font>
<p><font size=-1>The following is the text from a photocopied page of information

<p><font size=-1>COMPILER'S NOTE: The above information appears to have
been a typed excerpt from a book. There are several typographical errors,
such as the date of the EDWARDS' marriage appearing on the last line. (One
day after Spencer's death!) Other discrepancies include "Widow made application
Claiborne Co. Tenn. 3-23-1878" (1st paragraph) "Widow made application
1855,..." (last paragraph.)</font>
<p><font size=-1>Nov., 1997: Eva McCARTY sent a list of graves she had
transcribed from "NORRIS RESERVOIR GRAVE REMOVALS," Vol. I. Among the graves
in this book were those of "Katy" (RIDDLE) EDWARDS, Spencer's first wife,
and Artimicia (O'DELL) EDWARDS, his second. There were two graves for "Spencer
EDWARDS", apparently, one bears his name but no dates. That one is recorded
as "From: Big Barren Cem. To: Edwards Cem. Auth.: Spencer EDWARDS, Goin,
TN." The other, apparently next to Artimicia's grave, reads, "EDWARDS,
Spencer, B. ? D. 1848, From: Big Barren To: Edwards Cem., Auth: Spencer
EDWARDS - Goin, TN." Authorization for the removal of Artimicia's and Catherine
EDWARDS's graves were also recorded as "Spencer EDWARDS - Goin, TN". Since
the graves were moved in 1935, it is likely that either Spencer's son or
his grandson, both named for him, were the authorizers of the removals.</font>
<br><font size=-1>Children:</font>
<br><font size=-1>11 1<b> Anna<sup>3</sup> Edwards </b>was born about 1843
in Claiborne County, Tn.</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: The accurate full name of this child of Spencer
EDWARDS is not known. On the 1850 census, there is a seven-year-old female
named "Anna" Countyed in the home of Artemicia EDWARDS, widow of Spencer.
The name "Anna" does not appear in the "Old Speedwell" books nor does it
show on the list of heirs in the Probate index. On the latter, however,
there is a "Rachel" who does not show on the other sources. There are two
female children born to Spencer and Artie EDWARDS, who are listed as "name
unknown" in the EDWARDS books. Anna is thought to have been one of those
"unknown" females; Rachel may have been the other. On page 235 of the revised
version of the "Old Speedwell" book, one of the descendents of a child
of Spencer's is referred to as "Rachel Annie". It is possible that this
child is named for a daughter of Spencer's who might have been named "Rachel
Anna", but this is speculation and not supported by any real evidence.
Also, per the "Old Speedwell..." acCounty, Leta EDWARDS named a daughter
"Anna" and her sister, Sally, named one "Rachel." Again, no theory can
be proven. Anna appears again on the 1860 census record in "Artamacy" EDWARDS'
household; her age is cited as 16. She was not enumerated with her mother
in 1870. There is no clue as to where she might have been enumerated after
the 1870 enumeration. "Artamecia" EDWARDS does have a young couple enumerated
in her household that year whose relationship to Artamecia is not known
- "Daniel D. HOPPER," a 21-year-old school teacher and 15-year-old Elizabeth
HOPPER are in the household on enumeration day. The young couple are reported
to have married within the census year. This may be the 9-year- old "Elizabeth
EDWARDS" who is enumerated in the EDWARDS home in 1860; if so there has
been some error in recording the age on the two records. Since Spencer
is thought to have died in 1848, this Elizabeth could not be his daughter.
Furthermore, there is a daughter of Spencer's, Elizabeth, listed in the
probate index who is reported to have married a KECK. She would have been
much older than this Elizabeth, and is thought to have relocated to Laurel
County, KY with her husband prior to the 1850 census there. This young
bride of Daniel D. HOPPER does not appear to be "Anna" either, since she
would be considerably younger than Anna as reported in 1860.</font>

County, Tn, and after Aug 1870, married <b>Ben Hopper</b>.</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: The birth year of this daughter of Spencer EDWARDS'
has been calculated from the age given on census records as listed in the
references below. Martha EDWARDS, age 5, appears in the home of Artemicia
EDWARDS, widow of Spencer, on the 1850 census. The "Old Speedwell" books
refer to two "unknown female" children of Spencer EDWARDS. On the 1860
census, Martha, age 15, is listed next to "Anna" who is one year older.
This may be the other "name unknown" daughter listed for Spencer EDWARDS
in the EDWARDS' books. On the 1870 Census for Claiborne County, Martha
is listed as 25 years old in the home of "Artamecia" EDWARDS. She is one
of three young adults in the household. The other two are Daniel HOPPER,
a school teacher, and Elizabeth HOPPER, Daniel's 15 year-old-wife. Per
the notation on the census enumeration, the HOPPERs married in January,
1870. According to Lawrence EDWARDS and his sister, a daughter of Spencer
EDWARDS, "name unknown", married Ben HOPPER and "moved to Kansas. No data
on this marriage is provided in EDWARDS' book, and compiler has not succeeded
in locating an appropriate marriage record for this couple. Several HOPPER
households were extracted from the 1880 census records of Claiborne, Campbell
and Union Counties in TN, but none contained a household for "Ben and Martha
HOPPER."</font>

<p><font size=-1>Bio: Although there is no documentation to prove it, compiler
suspects that this Benjamin HOPPER may have been the son of John and Martha
HOPPER, who appear on the 1860 census for Claiborne County, TN. This record
shows a "Bery F." or "Benj F.", 16 years of age and the second son recorded
in this household in 1860. He appears to be a brother to 18-year-old Thomas
J. and 12-year-old David. Compiler made a photocopy of this page of the
census microfilm for the households enumerated before John's, so was not
careful to get a full picture of the household at the bottom of the page
(John HOPPER's). There were probably other persons listed in the household
after David D.'s name. No documentation for the marriage of Ben HOPPER
and Martha EDWARDS has been located. Lawrence EDWARDS, in his "OLD SPEEDWELL
FAMILIES" book, states that one of the daughters of Spencer EDWARDS, "name
unknown," married Ben HOPPER "and moved to Kansas." Since Martha was not
named in this family, compiler has assumed that she was one of the two
"name unknown" daughters of Spencer, and that she may have been the one
who married Ben HOPPER. The ages of Ben and Martha are very close per census
records.</font>

brother (name unknown) (who) married AUSMUS?; went to Texas; returned to
Tennessee, in 1953 for a visit, at the age of 87." Since Spencer, II was
not named in this acCounty, compiler has assumed this is probably he. Compiler
has added the "II" to differentiate him from his father and the son of
McKindry EDWARDS of the same name. The 1850 census lists Spencer EDWARDS
as a one-year-old male, born in TN. In 1860, he is listed in the household
of "Artamacy EDWARDS" as 11 years of age. There is a female, "Elizabeth",
who is two years younger than he. A marriage is listed for "Spencer EDWARDS
to Mahalla COOK, 22 JUL 1866." This Spencer would have been about 17 if
the census ages are accurate, but there is no evidence that this is the
correct marriage for this Spencer EDWARDS.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: Contact via "The Genealogical Helper Magazine," between
Bill HEINLE and compiler resulted in most of the initial information compiler
was able to find about the children of Bartlett H. and Elizabeth (QUILLEN)
O'DELL. Later research in Claiborne County, TN brought the three Lawrence
EDWARDS' books about the Old Speedwell commUnionty to light. This is apparently
where much of Mr. Heinle's data came from, too. Compiler was unable to
find specific documentation for the marriage of John "Jack" LAY and "Polly"
ODELL in Claiborne Co. For a while compiler was tempted to believe the
marriage took place outside of Claiborne County, and it may have; however,
Mary Pauline's parents were living in Claiborne County from 1840 until
they died. Direct descendents of the LAYs, Bill HEINLE and Eva McCARTY,
record Mary P. and "Jack" LAY's marriage in 1839 in Claiborne County, TN.
"Jack" and Mary P. LAY were enumerated in Claiborne County in 1850. By
1860 they were in the Fincastle P.O. area in Campbell County when the enumeration
was done. In 1870, Mary P. is enumerated "next door" to her daughter and
son-in-law, Elizabeth and James "CURNUTT", in Campbell County. "Jack" LAY
died in 1862, and Mary P. was shown as the head of her own household in
1870. Her three youngest daughters were still at home. March, 1996: Compiler
received a back issue of "Reflections", a quarterly newsletter of the Claiborne
County Historical Society which contained a feature article on the ODELS,
compiled by Marjorie WALSH, a descendent of Marshall L., Mary Pauline's
brother. Per the family group sheet for Bartlett and Elizabeth shown in
the article, "Polly" ODEL's name is given as "Mary Margaret 'Polly' ODELL".
The source of this data is not specified, but may have come from papers
Ms. WALSH found at the LDS Library in Salt Lake City. Nov. 1996: Compiler
established contact with Eva McCARTY of Clinton, TN, via correspondence
with Marjorie WALSH. Mrs. McCARTY, a desc. of Mary P. O'DELL LAY, has provided
detailed information on the LAY family. Since establishing contact with
other descendents of the Bartlett O'DELL family, several very specific
dates have been found on various members of Bartlett's family. Once specific
birth and death dates began to appear from tombstones, death records, etc.,
other conflicts in previously recorded data resulted. One instance of this
was the "ca" year of birth given to Mary P. (O'DELL) LAY. Her year of birth
had been calculated as "1824" until the discovery of Louisa/Eliza (O'DELL)
NELSON's tombstone. That stone records Louisa/Eliza's date of birth as
11 April 1824. Compiler re-examined her files to find evidence to support
the "1824" date of birth for Mary P.. The three census records available
show her as being 26 in 1850, 39 in 1860 and 50 in 1870. This type of variation
in age increments from one census to another have been common in the records
for the O'DELL family and their close kin. In NOV, 1996, compiler received
one of several letters from Eva McCARTY. Mrs. McCARTY wrote, "...I found
in the records of Marion County, TN, the Sardis Methodist Church Cemetery...Mary
Pauline&nbsp;<Polly>O'DELL LAY's tombstone says, 'Mary "A." 1818-1895 Wife
of John LAY'..." This is the first specific year of birth compiler has
found for this ancestor. The only documentation found to date that may
be that of the marriage of Jack and Mary Pauline LAY comes from two marriage
indexes -- one in Claiborne County, TN (found by compiler) and a photocopy
provided by Steve Stamm, which is probably from a TN state index. Both
sources show, "LAY, John (to) Catharine ODLE; 1840; Book 2; page 2." Mrs.
McCARTY reports that she found the date of the LAYs marriage in the work
of Mary Pauline's great grand daughter, Mary Alice (LAY) EARNHART, a family
historian with many years of work on the LAY family.</font>

in the Lay Cemetery near his farm in Campbell Co., TN.; later, his remains
were re-interred by the TVA at Baker's Forge Memorial Cemetery, also in
Campbell Co. Mrs. McCARTY related the traditional story of the arrival
and settling of the LAY families from ENGLAND. "According to Mary Alice
ERNHART, grand daughter of Wm. Quillin LAY, son of John Jack LAY and Mary
Pauline...the LAYs -- three LAY brothers --John, Jessee (and) David --came
from ENGLAND arrived in the Land of Charles in Southern Carolinas. There
John David LAY, son of Jessee and father of John "Jack" was born. John,
Jessee and David moved into VA near Gate City &amp; farmed the John Lay
Homestead. From there Jesse &amp; two sons, Jesse Jr. and John David moved
down to Elizabethton, TN. From there they moved down to Claiborne, Co.
TN (later where they lived became Campbell Co., TN)...The farm was located
on both sides of the Powell River in what is now Campbell Co...about 6
miles from LaFollette, TN. ..."Jack" and Mary Pauline "Polly" ran the Lay
gristmill on the Powell River....the Lay's used a ferry to get from (one)
side of the Powell river to the other side of the farm....the Dave Lay
Cave that was on the farm. Tradition says "Jack" hid Civil War Soldiers
in it. Also he hid gold in it. Family says Jack's son David found the gold
and that is how he bought the heirs out...John Jack is buried beside his
mother... ...It is said old Jesse Sr. was an old man when he came to Claiborne
Co TN. &amp; died not too many years after coming to Big Valley. Jesse
Jr. &amp; John David took over the farm --Then John Jack &amp; his son
David."</font>
<p><font size=-1>In notes on her family group sheets, Mrs. McCARTY wrote,

<p><font size=-1>BIO: In a letter to Marjorie WALSH, Coconut Creek, FL,
Sept. 1996, Eva McCARTY, another descendent of Bartlett O'DELL, listed
the children of Mary Pauline (O'DELL) and "Jack" LAY. Concerning Bartlett
LAY, Ms. McCARTY reported that he died in the Civil War at a place called
"Fishing Creek". Per Eva McCARTY, in her notes on her LAY ancestors: "During
the Civil War John LAY's sympathies were with the Union Cause. Although
he had two sons that served in the Union Army, his oldest son, Bartlett,
joined the Confederate Army. The following is from David Richard LAY, son
of Elisha LAY: 'Bartlett was in the Battle of Fishing Creek in Tennessee
near the Cumberland Gap. He was wounded in the leg by a cannonball. The
story goes that during the battle, one of Bartlett's brothers came upon
him. Bartlett asked for a drink and the brother went to a nearby creek
and brought him some water. The brother, who is thought to be David, told
David R. LAY, that it was one of the hardest things he ever had to do,
was to leave Bartlett. He never saw him again.'" Bartlett's age was given
as "10" on the 1850 census for Claiborne County. By census enumeration
time, 05 July 1860, the land on which the LAY farm was located had become
part of Campbell County, TN. Bartlett, who would by then have been about
20 years of age, was not enumerated with Jack and Polly's household. Compiler
checked other "LAY" households to see if he might have been working for
a relative or simply visiting in one of the relative's homes on that date,
but he was not located. Although the War did not actually begin until April,
1861, seven states had seceded from the Union by the time of President
LINCOLN's inauguration in March. It is possible that Bartlett had already
made known his difference in sympathies from his father's, and that he
had left the home because of these conflicts. In May, 1997, compiler established
contact with Steve STAMM, another descendent of the "Jack" LAY family.
In an E-mail message to compiler, Mr. STAMM wrote, "...The battle was known
by three different names at the time. The Confederates called it 'Fishing
Creek,' the Union called it 'Logan's Crossroads' and 'Mill Springs'. The
battle was fought on 19 Jan. 1862 near the modern day town of Nancy, Kentucky.
After the battle, which was a devastating defeat for the C.S.A., all the
dead were buried in a mass grave in a field...Just today, 26 May 1997,
the VA dedicated a cemetery on the battlefield with markers for each of
the C.S.A. soldiers killed in action. Martin B. LAY's (a.k.a. Bartlett
LAY) name is among those. I have pictures of his headstone. I also have
his service record. He was in the 15th Tennessee Inf. Company B..." On
page 408 of the Military Annals of Tennessee, Regimental Histories and
Memorial Rolls, under the heading "Company B", the name heading the right
hand column reads, "LAY, B.M., k. at Fishing Creek."</font>

in Tennessee.</font>
<p><font size=-1>BIO: Quillen ODELL is listed as the head of his own household,
about eight household numbers from his father, Bartlett, and just two numbers
before Benjamin AUSMUS on the 1840 census. Compiler searched for marriage
records for a female "AUSMUS" and a male "ODELL" in Claiborne County, TN
about 1837, but found none. Marriage indexes located at the Claiborne Co.
Library only went back to 1838, however. Thinking that Quillen might have
married in Washington County, TN, since it was not certain when Bartlett
moved his family to Claiborne County, compiler searched marriage indexes
in Jonesboro. Two possibilities were considered, but both were before 1835.
Neither of these listed the groom as "Quillen"; neither gave the bride's
surname as "AUSMUS." On the 1840 census, both Quillen and his wife are
listed as between the ages of 20-30, and there is a female under the age
of 5 in their household. March, 1996, compiler received a back issue of
"Reflections", the quarterly newsletter of the Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc.
which contained an article on the O'DELL family. The author, Marjorie WALSH,
gave 1821 as the birthdate of "Quillan" ODELL. She also listed his spouse
as "Mary AUSMUS". No marriage date or place was given. In September, 1996,
Marjorie WALSH forwarded a copy of a letter written to her by Eva McCARTY
of Clinton, TN, a descendent of Bartlett O'DELL's via his daughter, Mary
Pauline LAY. In that letter, Mrs. McCARTY states that Quillin O'DELL married
__?__ AUSMUS and that the couple moved from Claiborne County to ARKANSAS.
Later compiler discovered an entry on a CD of census indexes for 1850 showing
"Quillin ODELL" in Prairie Township, Franklin County, ARKANSAS. Compiler
ordered the microfilm for that census record and was successful in finding
the family there. "Quillin" was reported to be 29 years of age and born
in VIRGINIA. Mary, his wife, reported that she was born in TN and was 28
years old. The couple had four children, the oldest of whom was Elizabeth,
10 years of age and born in TENN. Malinda, 9, is also reported to have
been born in TN, but John W., a two-year old and "Malida" (name is difficult
to read, and may not be accurate), a one-year-old female were both born
in ARKANSAS. This would indicate that the couple moved from TN to AR sometime
between 1841 and 1848. Compiler examined the 1860 census for Franklin County,
AR, expecting to find the family again, but they did not appear. Some time
later, compiler posted a query on an internet bulletin board for that County.
Among the persons responding to this query was a resident of Carroll County
AR. He reported that "Q.B. O'DELL" was found on a census index for 1860
for that County. April, 1997: Compiler examined 1860 census microfilm for
Carroll County, AR. "Q.B. Odell" was found in Berryville, Prairie Township.
While compiler is satisfied that this is Quillen, son of Bartlett O'DELL,
there are some confusing bits of data on this census record, too. "Q.B"
is reported here to be 42 years of age, a farmer, born in VA. His wife,
rather than having the name "Mary" as on the previous census, is listed
as "Elizabeth A., 37, b. Ten. John W. is listed as 13 years of age -- only
a slight difference from the expected "12". Matilda (Malida, on the 1850
record) is 10 years old -- again, close enough to what was expected. There
is a John T. BUTTER or BUTLER, 28, Farmer, B. Ten. enumerated in the household
and a "Brunette", 18 years of age. Her last name is not registered, but
from the arrangement beneath the name of Mr. BUTTER, compiler assumed that
she was "Brunette BUTTER/BUTLER. The next household is that of James A.
CARTER and Malinda CARTER, 18, b Ten. Compiler feels sure that this is
Malinda, the daughter of Quillen and her husband. Since there seems to
be such a variation in the year of birth of Quillen O'DELL, compiler has
taken the liberty of recording his birth year as "Est. 1818-1821." Two
census records have shown his place of birth as VIRGINIA. Since it has
not been established just when Bartlett and his family moved from Washington
County, TN and when they appeared in Claiborne County, compiler is tempted
to believe that the family may have gone into VIRGINIA for a period of
time prior to settling in Claiborne County. "Place of birth" on various
census records for most of Bartlett's children shows "TN," yet Quillen
in two census reports is said to have been born in VA. Artemicia is said
to have been born in TN, yet in 1880, the informant for the enumerator
says she was born in VA. It is possible that the confusion in places of
birth is directly connected with the confusion of the day in determining
political lines or boundaries of this specific area. The County lines and
even the TN and NC state lines were changed several times in a relatively
short period of time. Consequently, many of the residents had good reason
to be confused about exactly where they lived -- was it in TN or VA or
NC? 'in Washington Co.? 'in Claiborne, Campbell or Union County? Since
there seems to be no simple answers to these questions, the search continues
for Bartlett and his family between 1815 when he appeared for the last
time on the Washington County Tax Lists and 1840 when he first appeared
on the census records for Claiborne County. Did he not appear sooner, simply
because he was not a property owner? Or was he not in Claiborne County
as early as Lawrence EDWARDS and others have believed?</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: As of March, 1996, compiler has been unable to locate
a marriage record for Quillen ODELL and (wife) AUSMUS. The fact that he
did marry an AUSMUS has been reported by Wm. HEINLE, a descendent of Quillen's
sister and by the EDWARDS' "Speedwell Families." Neither source included
a first name for Quillen's wife. In March 1996, compiler received a copy
of "Reflections", a newsletter by the Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc. which had
an article on the ODELL family. Marjorie WALSH, the author, reported Quillen's
wife to have been "Mary AUSMUS". The source, date or place of this marriage
was not given. Per the 1840 census, Quillen, his wife and a female under
five lived 8 households from his parents in Claiborne Co. The ages of Quillen
and his wife were between 20 and 30. Compiler did not find the couple on
the 1850 census in Claiborne County, TN. In Sept., 1996, Marjorie WALSH
sent compiler a photocopy of a letter she had received from Eva McCARTY
of Clinton, TN. Mrs. McCARTY is also a descendent of Bartlett's through
Mary Pauline (O'DELL) LAY. In that letter, Mrs. McCARTY writes that Quillin
O'DELL married "__?__ AUSMUS," and that this couple moved to ARKANSAS.
In research notes given to Ben O'DELL of Johnson City, TN by another O'DELL
researcher, there was a statement that Quillen had relocated to Franklin
County, AR. Compiler was successful in finding "Quillin O'dell" and wife,
"Mary" in Prairie Township of that County in 1850. At that time, Quillen
was reported to be 29 years of age and born in VA. Mary was 28 and born
in TN. The couple had four children enumerated in their household - Elizabeth,
10, b. TN; Malinda, 9, b. TN; John W., 2 b. AR and "Malida", 1 year of
age and born in AR. (The latter's given name was very difficult to read
on the microfilm, and may not be accurately reported here.) Examination
of the 1860 census film for Franklin County failed to locate the family.
Some time later, compiler posted a query on an internet bulletin board.
Responses to that query indicated that "Q.B. O'DELL" was listed on census
indexes for Carroll County, AR in 1860. The 1860 census for Carroll County,
AR, Prairie Township, Berryville P.O. commUnionty shows "Q.B. ODELL, 42,
Farmer, b. VA." In spite of the variance in age from the 1850 census, compiler
was confident that this was Quillen, the son of Bartlett O'DELL. The children
listed in his household were John W., Matilda C. (the "Malida" from 1850),
and next door to the O'DELLs is James A. CARTER, 28 and his wife, Malinda,
18, whom compiler feels sure is Malinda, the daughter of Quillen O'DELL,
who was 9 on the earlier census in Franklin County. The greatest discrepancy,
however, was in the data on Quillen's wife! In 1850, she was called "Mary";
her age was 28; her place of birth, TN. On the 1860 record, the wife of
Quillen O'DELL appears as "Elizabeth A."! She, too is reported to be from
TN; her age is 37. In a letter to compiler in 1996, Marjorie WALSH wrote
that Mary (AUSMUS) O'DELL died in Greenville (Franklin Co.) AR "...at the
home of one of her children". There was no date of death included in this
report, and Ms. WALSH said that she was unsure of her source of this information.
(She had recently moved, and had not located all of her resource files
at that time.) This plus the name difference found on the 1860 census could
indicate that Mary died between 1850 and 1860 in AR, and that Quillen had
remarried before the 1860 census enumeration.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: This child is probably the single female under 5
who was reported on the 1840 census in Claiborne County, TN in Quillen
O'DELL's household. Her age was recorded as "10" on the census in Franklin
County, AR, in 1850. The O'DELLs moved to Carroll County, AR before the
1860 census enumeration, and were found there in the Berryville area in
August of 1860. Elizabeth did not appear in "Q.B." O'DELL's household,
but she may have married before that time. "Mary", who is thought to have
been Mary AUSMUS and the mother of Elizabeth and her siblings, was not
listed in 1860 either. Instead, there was a 37-year-old "Elizabeth A."
listed in the usual place for wife of the head of the household. Marjorie
WALSH reports that Mary (AUSMUS) O'DELL died in Greenville (Franklin Co.)
AR "...in the home of one of her children..." Ms. WALSH gives no date for
that death, but it seems likely that Elizabeth had married prior to 1860,
that Mary may have died in Elizabeth's home, and that Quillen remarried
before the August enumeration of the 1860 census. Compiler has found no
documentation of Mary's death, Elizabeth's marriage or death, or of Quillen's
second marriage as of May, 1997, however.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: This daughter of Quillen O'DELL was reported to be
9 years of age, "born (in) TN", on the 1850 census for Franklin County,
AR. She was probably born shortly before the family removed from Claiborne
County, TN. Malinda did not appear in the household of "Q.B. O'DELL" in
Carroll County, AR in 1860, however, there was a household listed just
after that thought to be Quillen's, belonging to a "James A. CARTER" and
18-year- old "Malinda CARTER". Compiler feels this to be Malinda (O'DELL)
and her husband. On the page just after Q.B. O'DELL and James A. CARTER,
and three household numbers distant from CARTER's there is an "Andrew H.
CARTER" family. This is likely to be the father of James A. CARTER. Per
Marjorie WALSH, Mary (AUSMUS) O'DELL, the mother of Malinda, died in Greenville
(Franklin Co.) AR "...in the home of one of her children..." Ms. WALSH
gives no date of death for Mary, but from data taken from the 1850 and
1860 census records of the two Countyies, she probably died between 1850-1860.
An older daughter, Elizabeth O'DELL, is missing from the 1860 enumeration
of her father's household, so compiler suspects that Elizabeth had married,
and that Mary may have died in Elizabeth's home; however, it is possible
that Mary died in the CARTER home. Regardless, the 1860 census shows Quillen's
wife's name to be "Elizabeth Ann", rather than "Mary." Apparently both
of Quillen's wives were born in TN, and they must have been about the same
age, since Elizabeth Ann gives her age as "37" in 1860; Mary reported her
own as "28" ten years before.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: James A. CARTER's age is unclear as recorded on the
1860 census enumeration. It could be either "28" or "20"; compiler considered
"28" to be more likely. Per that census, James was born in TN. Compiler
discovered James A. CARTER and "Malinda, 18", enumerated in the household
immediately following that of "Q.B. O'DELL" in Carroll County in 1860.
Since Malinda O'DELL was not enumerated in her father's household, and
since her age would be 18 or 19, as calculated from the 1850 census, compiler
has made the assumption that this is Malinda O'DELL, now married to James
CARTER. On the following page of the census record, three household numbers
after James', the household of "Andrew H. CARTER" was enumerated. Andrew
was reported to be born in NC, his wife in KY, then five children ranging
in age from 22 to 9, were all born in TN. Compiler feels strongly that
this is the father of James A. CARTER. Andrew and his wife are 54 and 52
years of age respectively.</font>

years old and born in AR on the 1850 census in Prairie Township, Franklin
County, AR. Other children may have been born between John W. and his sister
Malinda, whose age was given as 9 on that census; if so, they did not survive
or were not in the household on either the 1850 or th 1860 census records.
Carroll County, ARKANSAS census of 1860 shows John W. as 13 years old.
On this census, the wife of "Q.B." O'DELL is listed as "Elizabeth A." rather
than "Mary." Her age is 37, very close to what Mary's would have been ten
years after she was recorded as "28" in Franklin County. Marjorie WALSH,
a descendent of Bartlett O'DELL's, wrote in a letter to compiler, that
Mary (AUSMUS) O'DELL died "...in Greenville, AR..."(Franklin County) "...in
the home of one of her children." No year of death was included with that
information. If this is true, Quillen evidently married again before Aug.,
1860. John's sister, Elizabeth, shown as 10 years of age on the earlier
census, was not listed in the household in 1860. She may have married and
moved from the home, or she, too, may have died before 1860. Another sister,
Malinda, was not enumerated in the O'DELLs' household in 1860, but there
is a "James A. CARTER, 28," and wife, "Malinda, 18" enumerated next door
to the O'Dells, who compiler believes to be Malinda O'DELL. Mary (AUSMUS)
O'DELL may have died in the home of one of the two daughters.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: Tradition has reported that Quillen O'DELL married
Mary AUSMUS in Claiborne County, TN prior to 1840. This is supported by
the 1850 census enumeration in Franklin County, AR, where his wife is recorded
as "Mary." The 1860 census for Carroll County, AR shows "Elizabeth A."
as the wife of Q.B. O'DELL. This is in keeping with the report of Marjorie
WALSH that Mary (AUSMUS) O'DELL died in Greenville, AR (Franklin Co.) at
the home of one of her children. The O'DELLs' oldest child was also "Elizabeth",
but she would only have been about 20 years of age at the time of the 1860
census enumeration. She was not listed in the household, so probably had
married and moved from the home. In fact, that may have been the child's
home where Mary died, but compiler has no information about Elizabeth QUILLEN,
and does not know if she survived until Mary's death. Using the report
from Ms. WALSH and these two census records, it would appear that Mary
died between 1850 and 1860, and that Quillen had remarried by 01 AUGUST
1860 (the date of the enumeration.) The maiden name of Elizabeth Ann is
unknown as of May, 1997.</font>

(Bartlett<sup>1</sup>) was born 11 Apr 1824 in Claiborne County, Tn, and
on 23 Mar 1856 in Claiborne County, Tn, married <b>Lindsey H. Nelson</b>,
son of Washington Nelson and Elizabeth (NELSON), who was born 6 Jan 1839
in Tennessee. Louisa/Eliza died on 3 Dec 1903 in Campbell County, Tn. Lindsey
H. died on 16 May 1883 in Campbell County, Tn.</font>
<p><font size=-1>BIO: This daughter of Bartlett and Elizabeth ODELL was
not included on William HIENLE's family group sheet at first contact with
him re the siblings of his Mary Pauline "Polly" (O'DELL) LAY. It was not
until compiler compared the photocopy and the actual microfilm of the 1850
census that the name "Louisa" became clear. Mr. Heinle had listed Elizabeth
Mahala O'DELL as two different people - one married to Henry ELLISON, the
other married to Lindsey NELSON. Lawrence EDWARDS, in his revised edition
of "OLD SPEEDWELL FAMILIES", also missed the name of "Louisa" in this family.
He recorded the marriage of Lindsey NELSON to "Eliza" O'DELL. Marriage
indexes in Claiborne County have confirmed the name as it appears on the
1850 census - "Claiborne County Marriages 1838-1891", records this marriage
as "Lindsa" NELSON to "Louisa ODEL." Compiler calculated the year of Louisa's
birth by comparing the ages/ birthdates of her siblings in relation to
the age given for Louisa on the 1850 census. Then Eva McCARTY discovered
the NELSONs' graves at the Jones Cemetery "near the Bethlehem CommUnionty...between
LaFollete and Well's Spring - off Hwy 63" in Campbell County, TN. Per the
cemetery index, "Eliza" NELSON was born 11 Apr 1824 and died 03 Dec 1903.
(Nov. 1996) As compiler researched the possible date of birth for Louisa/Eliza
O'DELL, the confusion only increased! On the 1850 census, Louisa's age
is given as "26"; in 1860, in the home of "Lindsey NELSON," Louisa is "20";
in 1870, her age is "32" and then in 1880, Louisa is reported to be "55"!
Lindsey's age shows more consistency from one record to another, but even
here there is some confusion. In 1860, "Lindsay" is enumerated as head
of his own household in Campbell County, TN, on 05 July. His age is given
as "21." Then on 19 July that year, there is a "Linsay NELSON", 20 years
of age, enumerated in the household of Elizabeth NELSON in Union County.
It would be easy enough to suggest that compiler had picked up a different
NELSON family in Union County in 1860, except that the names of all other
members of the family and their ages agree with data given by descendents
of Lindsey NELSON to Eva McCARTY! The Lindsey, who was head of the household
in Campbell County has not only the wife named "Louisa,", but a daughter,
"Elisabeth" who is recorded as 3 years old, and a son "Henderson" who is
one year of age. March, 1996, compiler received a back issue of "Reflections",
a newsletter by the Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc., which contained an article
on the ODELLs by Marjorie WALSH. Ms. WALSH lists this child of Barlett
ODELL as "Louiza 'Eliza' ODELL" and gives her year of birth as "1824".
The source of this data is not specified. Also in 1996, compiler established
contact with Benjamin L. O'Dell, another descendent of Marshall O'Dell.
Ben sent photocopies of documents he had concerning the family. One of
these, which is identified as only "page 62, section 53, Elizabeth M. Ellison
Widow Certificate" an affidavit sworn by "Eliza Nelson in Campbell County,
Tenn., age 71, as she was at their wedding about 12-1851 or 1852. Her present
address is Powell's River, Campbell County, Tenn...." The date of that
affidavit is reported as being 1895. (This would calculate to about 1824
as Eliza's date of birth.) Marjorie WALSH forwarded to compiler, a letter
from Eva McCARTY, yet another descendent of Bartlett O'dell via his daughter,
Mary Pauline (O'DELL) LAY. In the letter, Ms. McCARTY states,"After Barlett
died Elizabeth lived with her daughter Elizabeth O'Dell Nelson in Union
County, TN..." Mrs. McCarty cites her grandmother, LaVisa Lay as the source
of her information concerning Bartlett and Elizabeth (QUILLEN) O'DELL.
(Per the Widow's Pension File of Elizabeth M. ELLISON, she lived in Union
County; Louisa Eliza resided in Campbell Co.) Eva McCARTY has provided
compiler with a photocopy of a compilation of Campbell County, TN census
for 1900. In Dist. 8, p 180, household/family respectively. There are two
"Boarders" enumerated in this household - Alford MELTABARGER, 22, and "Eliza
NELSON, 76." Other data included on this record is Eliza's date of birth,
"Apr 1824"; she reported giving birth to 7 children, 3 of whom were still
living at the time of the 1900 enumeration. To compilicate matters even
more, Louisa/Eliza O'DELL's sister, Mary Pauline "Polly" (O'DELL) LAY is
also reported to have been born in 1824! Unless they were twins (a real
possibility, since there seemed to have been several sets of twins in the
O'DELL family from generation to generation), this is unlikely. To compiler's
knowledge, there have been no reports of twins in Bartlett and Elizabeth's
family. The only real consistency compiler has found among census records
of Bartlett's family, is that the ages reported from census record to census
record are NOT consistent! Since most of the members of the family were
uneducated, and reported that they were not able to read and write, this
is probably not surprising.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: There seems to be much confusion about the data on
Lindsay NELSON and his family. Claiborne County, TN marriage indexes record
the marriage of "Lindsa" NELSON to "Louisa ODEL" in Claiborne Co., 23 March
1856. On the 1850 census for the same County, "Louiza", whose age is given
as "26" was enumerated in the household of her parents, Bartlett and Elizabeth
O'DELL. In 1996, Eva McCARTY and compiler began to share data on the O'DELL
ancestors. Shortly before that time, compiler established contact with
two other descendents of the O'DELL family, Ben O'DELL and Marjorie (WHEELER)
WALSH. Mr. O'DELL provided copies of documents from Elizabeth M. ELLISON's
widow's pension file. Elizabeth was a sister to Louisa/Eliza O'DELL, and
in these documents, there was an affidavit sworn to by "Eliza NELSON" of
Campbell County, TN. Mrs. WALSH shared commUnioncation between Eva McCARTY
and herself which called Lindsay's wife "Elizabeth". It was later confirmed
that this came from lore handed down to Mrs. McCARTY from her grandmother,
Lavisa LAY, and showed confusion between Louisa/Eliza and her sister, Elizabeth
Mahala (O'DELL) ELLISON. In Feb. 1997, Mrs. McCARTY visited with a direct
descendent of the NELSONs. Dolly NELSON McElory and a cousin of hers, gave
Mrs. McCARTY as much data on the family as they could remember without
consulting written collections. In that interview, which Mrs. McCARTY summarized
in a letter to compiler, the NELSONs said that Lindsay's parents were Washington
and Elizabeth (maiden name unknown) NELSON, and that their children were
Peter, Mary, Lindsey A., Martha J., Daniel, Elizabeth and James. Per this
report, Lindsey Albert NELSON was born 06 Jan. 1839, died in May, 1883
in Campbell County, TN and married in 1856 in Claiborne County to Eliza
O'DELL. They gave Eliza's date of birth as 11 April 1824. They reported
that Eliza died in Campbell County, TN on 03 Dec. 1903. The children of
this couple were reported to be Elizabeth, Henderson L., Nancy and Norvil/Narville
Henderson NELSON. Both Mrs. McCARTY and compiler found Lindsey and Louisa
NELSON in Campbell County on the 1860 census. Lindsey was 21, Louisa 20/26
(very difficult to read); the couple had two children - Elisabeth, 3, and
Henderson, 1. Compiler found the family again in 1870, still in Campbell
County, but there were three more children in the household - Nancy, 8,
Norvil, 5 and Daniel, 2. By 1880, Elizabeth was gone from the home; Henderson
was 21; Nancy was 18 and classified as married and "Marvel H." was 15.
There was also a 2-year-old "grand daughter" named Martha E. in the home.
One other conflict in data reported by Ms. McELORY is the middle name of
Lindsey NELSON. Per Ms. McE., his middle name was "Albert." As a side comment
in her letter to compiler, Eva McCARTY wrote, "...Dolly said her father
Albert Henderson said he was named after his father Lindsey Albert and
the Henderson from his grandfather which I'm assuming was Bartlett H. O'DELL,
so the H. in Bartlett must be Henderson..." Yet, on two of the four census
records examined by compiler, Lindsey's name appeared with "H." as his
middle initial; only in 1850 did it appear as "Lindsey A." Compiler suspects
that Lindsey's middle name was "Henderson", and that it may have come from
his own father or grandfather. On the 1880 census, in the same Civil District
of Campbell County, there was a household listed for "Henderson NELSON,"
one year older than Lindsey. Other males known to be related to Lindsey
appear with "H." as a middle initial; "Henderson" may well have been a
commonly used name in this family. Compiler examined census records for
Claiborne, Campbell and Union Countyies in TN for 1860, 1870 and 1880 in
an attempt to learn more about Lindsey's parents and siblings. Washington
NELSON was not found on any of these films, however Eva McCARTY included
a summary of the household of "Washington NELSON" in Campbell County, TN
from the 1850 census records. In that household Ms. McCARTY found "Washington,
34, Elizabeth, 32, Peter, 15, Mary, 13, Lindsey A. 11, Martha J., 9, Daniel,
6, and Elizabeth, 1." Elizabeth, the wife of Washington NELSON, appeared
on the 1860 record as 42 years of age (this is in agreement with Ms. McELORY's
report of her birth in 1818). Ms. McELORY also reported to Mrs. McCARTY
that Elizabeth was born in NC; per this census record, she was born in
VA. In 1860 members of her household were Peter, 26, Linsey, 20, Martha
J., 18, Daniel, 17, Elizabeth, 11 and James, 8. There was no Mary in the
household. There was also a "William NELSON, 24, b. TN" in the next household
in 1860. Elizabeth appeared again in 1870 and 1880 in Union County. According
to these records, children Martha, Elizabeth , Daniel and James were still
in their mother's household. All were over the age of 25 by 1880. On all
three records, there was an older couple, "Martin and Barbry NELSON" enumerated
next door to Elizabeth and her children. (Martin appeared about 20 years
older than Elizabeth NELSON on all three records.) Compiler suspects that
Martin may have been the father of Washington NELSON/grandfather of Lindsey;
this is not confirmed. The only Washington NELSON found by compiler was
from a census index showing "Washington NELSON, Campbell Co., TN 1850."
There is some question that there may be two NELSON families, one in Campbell
and one in Unionon County, TN, with identical given names and similar ages.
If not, there is still the question as to why Lindsey NELSON would have
appeared in both his own household and Elizabeth NELSON's on the 1860 enumerations.</font>

<p><b><font size=-1>(7) Elisha Jordan<sup>2</sup> O'Dell</font></b><font size=-1>,
(Bartlett<sup>1</sup>) was born 15 Aug 1827 in Claiborne County, Tn, and
on 13 Jan 1848 in Claiborne County, Tn, married <b>Hannah Williams </b>who
was born in Oct 1830 in Tennessee. Elisha Jordan died after Apr 1910 in
ILLINOIS (?). Hannah died after Apr 1910 in ILLINOIS (?).</font>
<p><font size=-1>BIO: Jordan O'DELL was born "nearly twelve miles from
Tazewell, Tennessee..." (As stated in his affidavit 14 Jan. 1908, Mercer
Co., IL). Per Deed Book E-49, Jordan purchased land from Wm. GUTHERIE in
Laurel Co., KY, 18 SEP 1858; however, he was on the 1850 census in Claiborne
Co., TN. His son, James, was born in Laurel Co., but three older children
were reported born in TN. History of Pine Tree Baptist Church states that
the church was organized in 1867 by Elders Jordan O'DELL, (et al) ... in
1867 Jordan's daughter, Elizabeth, was married in Laurel Co.; in JAN 1868
his son, Nathaniel, married Hannah M. (LICKLITER) GUTHERIE, a widow and
12 years his senior. Jordan or members of his family were not located on
the 1870 census in Laurel Co. March 1996; Compiler received a back issue
of "Reflections"; the newsletter from Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc., which had
an article about the ODELL family. It was compiled by Marjorie WALSH, desc.
of Marshall L. ODELL, Jordan's brother. Ms. WALSH supplied a complete birthdate
as well as a first name. Per Ms. WALSH's data, "Elisha Jordan ODELL" was
born 15 JUL 1827. The source of her data was not listed. Receipt of the
C.W. Widow's Pension File for Sarah M. (Mrs. Marshall L.) O'DELL, brought
evidence that Jordan had removed from Laurel County, KY to the state of
ILLINOIS. On 14 January 1908, Jordan swore via an affidavit in Mercer County,
IL, that he was a brother to Marshall L. O'DELL, and gave testimony as
to Marshall's age and year of birth. On that document, Jordan's residence
is given as "Joy, Mercer County, Illinois." Included in his testimoney
for Marshall, is the the information that he (Jordan) had always been led
to believe that he was about five years older than Marshall, and that Marshall
was born about 1832. By inference, Jordan has supported Mrs. WALSH's report
of his own year of birth as 1827; but he gave his month of birth as "August."
In April, 1997, compiler examined census records from Mercer County, IL
for 1900 and 1910. In 1900, Jordan and Hannah were enumerated in Millersburg
Township, Mercer County. Again Jordan's ("Elisha J." on the record) month
and year of birth are given as "Aug. 1827." His age on this census is given
as "72". The couple has been married 52 years. "Elisha J." gives his occupation
as "Clergyman." He reports that he is able to read, but cannot write. A
grand daughter, Lela, whose last name is very difficult to read, but may
be "ALLBER", is enumerated in their household. This child is reported to
be 9 years of age, born in IL. Her father's place of birth is given as
IL, also, but her mother's is "KY." Before leaving Laurel County, this
couple had two daughters, Elizabeth A. and Mary M. Lela may have been the
child of one of these two daughters; however, Hannah reports that she has
given birth to 11 children, only 7 or 8 (numeral is smeared) are still
living. There could easily have been other daughters who would have been
candidates for mother of Lela. In the household next door to the O'DELLS,
is William ODELL, 30, born in KY in April of 1870. William is thought to
be the son of Nathaniel O'DELL. In 1910, "Elisha J." is again enumerated
in Millersburg Township, in the commUnionty of "Joy Village." He is reported
to be 83 years of age, married to Hannah now a total of 61 years. This
time, his occupation is listed as "Labor/Livery Man." Although compiler
has found no death record for Elisha Jordan O'DELL (as of 21 April 1997),
considering his age on the 1910 census, he probably died in Mercer County,
IL.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: 1850 Census records Hannah's age as "19" which calculated
to about 1831 as a year of birth. The 1860 census gave her age as "25"
and recorded her name as "Annah." The discovery of this couple in Mercer
County, IL in 1900 and 1910 was most helpful in getting more accurate information
on her age. On the 1900 census for Millersburg Township, Hannah gave her
age as "69" (enumeration date, 26 June). Hannah reported that she was born
in October, 1830 in TENNESSEE. She and her husband had been married 52
years. Hannah reported that she had given birth to eleven children. Her
response to the question "how many are still living?" is unclear on the
microfilm. It appears to be either "7" or "8". Hannah reported, as did
her husband, that she could read, but could not write. Enumerated in the
household with Hannah and her husband, "Elisha J." O'DELL, is a nine-year-old
female who is classifed as the couple's grand- daughter. The child's surname
is also smudged on the film, but appears to be Lela "ALLBER". Lela's place
of birth is given as IL; which of the O'DELL's daughters was her mother
is unknown. Lela's birthdate is given as "Jan., 1891." In the household
next door to Elisha and Hannah, is William ODELL, who evidently is a son
to Nathaniel, the O'DELL's oldest son. William reported that he was born
in April, 1870, in KENTUCKY. The 1910 census for "Joy Village" shows Hannah
and her husband, now married 61 years, as 79 and 83 years of age respectively.
Elisha's occupation has now been changed from "Clergyman" to "Livery Man."
Apparently the couple is still able to care for themselves, since there
is no one else enumerated in their home, and compiler did not notice any
of the immediate family living nearby. Although no death data has been
found for Elisha and Hannah O'DELL, considering their ages on this census,
it is likly that they both died in Mercer County.</font>

<br><font size=-1>36 2<b> Mary M. O'Dell </b>was born about 1853 in Claiborne
County, Tn.</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: There was a birth record for "M.M. O'DELL", child
of E.J. and Hannah on a microfilm of Laurel County births, deaths, marriages
between 1852-1900 found in the Laurel County, KY Public Library in London,
KY. At first, compiler thought Mary M. to be the same child, but then the
1860 census gave her age as "7". The birth record on film was for a September,
1856 birth. On the 1900 census for Mercer County, IL, Hannah, Mary's mother,
reported that she had given birth to 11 children in her 52 years of marriage,
but only seven of them were still living. Since Mary's brother, James M.
was listed as 3 years of age in 1860, compiler thought he might have been
the "M.M." born in '56. James, too, was enumerated in Mercer Co., IL in
1900; his date of birth was given as "Aug, 1858." According to these reports,
there could easily have been another child born to Hannah and E. Jordan
between Mary and James. Compiler did not find a marriage record for Mary
M. The last record found of this family in Laurel County, KY was at the
time of the marriage of Mary's sister, Elizabeth A., to J. GAINS in 1867.
They were not found on the 1870 census for that County. Compiler discovered
through an affidavit signed by Jordan in 1908 that he was a resident of
Mercer County, IL. We now know that he was there as early as 1900, but
we do not yet know how much before that he might have arrived in Mercer
County. A grand daughter of Hannah and Elisha Jordan was enumerated in
their household in 1900. The young lady's first name was clearly "Lela",
but her last name was very difficult to decipher. It appeared to be "ALLBER."
Compiler has not been able to determine who Lela's mother might have been.
It is possible that Mary could have been the mother, but there is no strong
evidence to that effect.</font>

County, Tn. Elizabeth Mahala died on 23 Jan 1910 in Claiborne County, Tn.
Henry died on 17 Apr 1895 in Union/Claiborne, Tn.</font>
<p><font size=-1>BIO: The exact year of Elizabeth Mahala's birth is not
known. Per the 1840 census, Bartlett and Elizabeth O'DELL had one female
in their household who was between the ages of 5 and 10. This child would
probably have been E.M. Then in the "OLD SPEEDWELL..." reference, on page
279, the dates for this wife of Henry ELLISON are given as "1835-23 Jan.
1910," then on the same page but a different section, the dates are given
as "1830-23 Jan. 1910." Examination of census records after 1840 was of
minimal help. Elizabeth Mahala's age on the 1850 census, in Bartlett's
household, is difficult to read, but seems to be either "20" or "24." After
her marriage, Mahala's age on the 1860 census is "26"; in 1870, she is
reported to be "38" and on 1880 census records, she is "49." (Compiler
decided at this point to estimate her year of birth as "About 1830.") March
1996; Compiler received a back issue of "Reflections", the newsletter of
the Claiborne Co. Hist. Soc. It contained an article about the ODELL family
by Marjorie (WALSH) WISDOM, desc. of Marshall ODELL, Elizabeth's brother.
The specific date of birth has been added per her data, however Ms. WALSH
did not cite the exact source of this data. A collection of research notes
given to Benjamin L. O'DELL, another descendent of Marshall L. O'DELL,
included a synopsis of Elizabeth Mahala's application for Widow's Pension
from her husband's Civil War Service. Ben has provided copies of these
research notes, but the identity of the researcher is not clear to compiler.
Included in the synopsis of the pension file is the following:</font>
<p><font size=-1>"...Affidavit of widow for pension in Unionon County,
Tenn., 1895, states her maiden name was Elizabeth M. ODLE, and married
Henry ELLISON 12-23-1852, by Wm. WILLIAMS, Reverend, Claiborne County,
Tenn., that her husband enlisted in Barboursville, Kentucky. Affidavit
of Elisa NELSON in Campbell County, Tenn. Application for reimbursement
was made by M. W. ELLISON, Unionon County, Tenn. 1910, Sharps Chapel, Tenn.,
age 39, for burial of Elizabeth M. ELLISON that he was a son in law, boarded
by M.W. ELLISON and wife M.E. ELLISON and she was buried in Broden Grave
Yard, 13th Dist. said County, soldier died 4-17-1895."</font>
<p><font size=-1>The "Elisa NELSON" mentioned in this synopsis would probably
be "Louiza 'Eliza' O'DELL", a sister of Elizabeth Mahala's, who married
Lindsay NELSON. The son-in-law mentioned was probably a son-in-law of Marion
and Mary Emily ELLISON's; Mary Emily, a daughter to Henry and Elizabeth
Mahala, married Marion ELLISON. Per the research documents described above,
Elizabeth M. (O'DELL) ELLISON was assigned Widow Certificate #420193, on
file, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC. November,
1996: Eva McCARTY, another O'DELL descendent who lives in Clinton, TN included
her transcription of a listing for the ELLISON family in the 1870 census
for Unionon County, TN. Per that source, "Mahaley" was residing in Unionon
County; her age was given as "38" which would calculate to a birth year
of about 1832. Her husband's age was given as 38 also. Mrs. McCARTY sent
compiler a single page from a cemetery index which is headed "Braden Cemetery
(Continued)". Above that heading, Mrs. McCARTY has noted "Blue Springs
Hollow Speedwell, TN. Claiborne Co." Among the graves recorded on this
page is that of Henry ELLISON, Co. C 1st TN Inf; no dates are recorded
beside Henry's name. The next grave noted is that of "Iliza M. ELLISON,
Apr. 26, 1899 - Oct. 2, 1899." This is obviously not the grave of Elizabeth
Mahala O'DELL ELLISON, nor does hers appear on this page of the index.
Among the "mysteries" involved in tracing Elizabeth and her husband to
their place of burial is the question of "Is 'Broden Grave Yard' and 'Braden
Cemetery' the same cemetery? If they are, is this cemetery in Unionon or
Claiborne County? If they are not, are Henry and Mahala buried in separate
cemeteries?"</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: In June, 1996, compiler received a packet of data
on various members of the Barlett H. O'DELL family, including the one-page
genealogy of the James ELLISON family and a continuing genealogy of his
son Henry. Per this genealogy, James and two brothers migrated from NORTH
CAROLINA to the Powell River area which lies in both Claiborne and Campbell
Countyies of TN. James and his wife, Elizabeth or Eliza AUSMUS, were the
parents of at least six children; although this one-page genealogy shows
only four, the last of whom was Henry ELLISON. Henry's son, W. Marshall
"Marsh" ELLISON was apparently the source of most of the data on the page,
but the actual compiler is not cited. Another photocopy in the packet of
data on the ELLISON family was what appears to be a synopsis of the Civil
War Pension File/Widow's Pension File of Henry ELLISON. This page contains
two sections, the first of which reads as follows: ELIZABETH M. ELLISON...Widow
of Henry ELLISON, a Private in Co. C. Regiment 1 - Tenn. Cal., Infantry...Affidavit
made by soldier Henry ELLISON 1877 that he was wounded accidentally in
the service by a fellow soldier while in line of his duty 1865, Dec. 17,
near Morristown, Tenn.; that 'I was on detail duty.'</font>
<p><font size=-1>The second section on the page seems to be someone's summary
of reports on Henry's C.W. duty and his injury... Under command of Colonel
Palmer of the 15th Pennsylvania Regiment order from General Burnside --
Affidavit made in Unionon Co. Tenn. 1876 by 2nd Lieutenant Caide M. Rogers
who states he was detailed on duty by Gen Burnside and etc., same place
as above. Also affidavit made in Unionon County, Tenn. by Berry Ellison,
Wm. W. Braden, Privates in Co. C, Tenn. Inf., Vol. were attached to the
fifteenth Penna. Calv. and while in Morristown, Dec. 1873, (This date must
be an error) while on march and in line of duty while soldiers were passing
through fence, said soldier was dismounted and another soldier's horse
ran against the said Henry Ellison's horse and the soldier's gun fired
and shot said soldier through the left leg and etc. The soldier died 4-17-1895
shown by affidavit of Marion W. ELLISON and Andrew C. BRADEN, Unionon Co.,
Tenn. Affidavit of widow for pension in Unionon County, Tenn., 1895, states
her maiden name was Elizabeth M. Odle, and married Henry Ellison 12-23-1852,
by Wm. Williams, Reverend, Claiborne County, Tenn., that her husband enlisted
in Barboursville, Kentucky. Affidavit of Elisa Nelson in Campbell County,
Tenn., age 71, as she was at their wedding about 12-1851 or 1852...</font>
<p><font size=-1>The latter document states that Elizabeth "was buried
at Broden Grave Yard, 13th Dis., said County..." (It is uncertain if "said
County" refers to Unionon or Campbell Co., TN) The single-page ELLISON
family genealogy states that the three brothers, Berry, Ben and Henry ELLISON
"are probably buried in the National Cemetery in Knoxville." In a letter
to compiler in Nov. 1996, Eva McCARTY included a photocopy from a cemetery
index which is headed "Braden Cemetery (Continued)...(page) 35." That page
has an alphabetical list of graves found in Braden Cemetery which includes
several EDWARDS and ELLISON names. There is evidently a military marker
there for "ELLISON, Henry Co. C 1st TN Inf," but no dates are given. The
next grave listed is for "ELLISON, Iliza M. Apr. 26, 1899 - Oct. 2, 1899."
Elizabeth Mahala's name is not on this page. Mrs. McCARTY also points out
that this Cemetery is located at "Blue Springs Hollow" in Speedwell (Claiborne
Co.) TN. Earlier data provided to compiler by Wm. HEINLE, another O'DELL
descendent, gave the marriage data for Henry and Elizabeth (O'DELL) ELLISON.
The 1850 census enumeration for the household of James ELLISON shows Henry
as 19 years of age. He is listed as the second oldest child in the ELLISON
home. A transcription from the 1870 census of Unionon County, TN shows
Henry and "Mahaley" both as 38 years of age. The 1880 census for Unionon
County, p 23, shows Henry, 49, "crippled", occupation "farmer." "Elizabeth
M., 49, wife, keeping house," etc. Henry's mother, "Eliza ELISON" was enumerated
one household before Henry's, and the household just before Eliza's is
that of "Nancy CLEMENS", her daughter Mary EDWARDS, James M., 5, and John,

<br><font size=-1>BIO: Per the revised book of Lawrence EDWARDS on the
old families of Speedwell, TN, Mary "M" ELLISON was born in Feb., 1860.
In November, 1996, compiler received a letter from Eva McCARTY. In the
letter, Mrs. McCarty quoted a transcription of the 1870 census for Unionon
County, TN. On that transcription of the enumeration of the household of
Henry ELLISON, Mary Emily's name does not appear. If Edwards' date of birth
is accurate, Mary "M" should have been about 10 years of age. Sometime
later, compiler searched census microfilm for the same County for 1860,
1870 and 1880. Mary Emily (Mary "M") ELLISON did not appear on either of
the first two records. Finally, compiler found her on the 1880 census.
"Mary Emily" was 8 years of age, indicating that she was not born until
about 1872. WILSON's book reported that "Marion Emily m. _____ELLISON of
Unionon Co." The revised EDWARDS' book states that she married "Marion
ELLISON." No other details are given. Ben L. O'DELL sent compiler several
pages of research notes, etc. from a genealogist who was working on the
ELLISON and O'DELL families. The identity of the researcher is not certain.
One page of what appears to be notes taken from documents found in Elizabeth
M. ELLISON's Widow's Pension File, contains the following statements: "...Application
for reimbursement was made by M.W. ELLISON, Unionon County, Tenn. 1910,
Sharps Chapel, Tenn., age 39, for burial of Elizabeth M. ELLISON that he
was a son in law, boarded by M.W. ELLISON and wife M.E. ELLISON and she
was buried in Broden Grave Yard, 13th Dist. said County, Soldier died 4-17-1895."
M.W. and M.E. ELLISON are thought by this compiler to be Marion and Mary
EMILY (ELLISON) ELLISON; however, there is no information in either of
these two sources re the children of this couple.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: Compiler has traced Marion ELLISON from the sources
listed below, back to the 1860 census, when his father, Joseph ELLISON,
son of Robert, was shown as head of his household with wife, Margaret M.,
Bradley, 4; Nancy E., 2; and "Marien W." whose age was given as "8/12."
This household was enumerated 09 AUG 1870, and "Marien" was reported to
have been born in Sept. of the census year. Calculation would bring his
age to almost 11 months, rather than the "8/12" as recorded on the census.
Joseph ELLISON was probably a cousin to Henry ELLISON, making Marion and
Emily "M" second cousins.</font>

Compiler located the grave of "Cpl. Marshall L. Odel; Co. E 6th TN Infy"
in the Hopper Cemetery near Tazewell. In addition to the military data
given, the dates on Marshall's tombstone read, "April 11 1832 - 04 Sept
1909" The grave of Marshall's second wife, Sarah EDWARDS ODELL is nearby;
there are several other ODELL graves in this cemetery. Three or four old
stones stand under an old tree in a far corner of the cemetery, but inscriptions
are not readable. Compiler suspects one of these may be that of Serena
HOPPER ODELL, Marshall's first wife. On another old stone only "D ODELL"
could be read; this may be the grave of Marshall's son, David, twin to
Jonathon. Feb. 1996: Compiler received Bartlett ODELL's pension file, for
service the TN Militia during the War of 1812. Bartlett, Marshall's father,
had been awarded two Bounty Land warrants from the final B.L. Act in 1855.
Elizabeth filed in 1871 for a widow's pension; at that time her residence
was given as the home of M.L. ODELL...11 miles west of Tazewell, Claiborne
Co., TN. From the documents contained in this file, compiler believed that
Elizabeth made her home with Marshall until she died in October, 1873.
July, 1996: Receipt of the Civil War Widow's Pension File for "Sarah M.
widow of Marshall L. O'Dell", from the National Archives, revealed the
information that Marshall had applied for and had been granted an invalid's
Pension for his Civil War service sometime between November, 1882 and 1890.
In July, 1890, Marshall tendered a "Declaration for Original Invalid Pension
Under the Act of June 27, 1890." In that application, he states that he
has received a pension under Certificate No. 430-594. He apparently was
attempting to obtain increased benefits under the new Act of Congress.
Among the documents dealing with the earlier application for pension is
a report of service and disability from the Office of the Adjutant General.
That report states that Marshall was reported absent from his company due
to illness from Aug., 1862 to Feb., 1863. Then on 30 April 1863, the record
reads, "deserter on acCounty of being absent April 1/63. June 30/63 present"
with remark, "Returned to his Compy from being absent sick May 30/63; was
tried by the Provost of the regt for absence without leave and acquitted."
He was mustered out of the army 15 March 1865 at Wilmington, NC. The 1890
Declaration Application describes Marshall ODELL as he appeared at 57 years
old..."height, 6 feet 1 inches; complexion Fair, hair, Dark; eyes Blue."
The symptoms of his disability are listed as -- "Cattarh In head and Rheumatis
in Back &amp; Limbs &amp; General Disability Totally Disabled to Work With
out Pain &amp; Misery." In January, 1898, the Office of Pensions sent a
form to Marshall to update his file. On that form Marshall responded to
questions concerning his first wife and the names and birth dates of his
children who were still living. Marshall confirmed that he and Sarah EDWARDS
were married in Claiborne County in 1869 by Wm. Williams. He lists by name
seven children still living and gives the birth date of each. To the questions
"Were you previously married? If so, please state the name of your former
wife and date and place of her death or divorce.", Marshall answered with
"Surreny Dec Jan 19 186- Claiborne Co Tenn." (It should be noted that one
form appears to bear the actual signature of Marshall, but all other places
calling for his signature show his name with "His X Mark"). It seems apparent
that Marshall could not write; therefore his answers were written by some
other person. (David HOPPER, a brother-in-law to Marshall, takes an oath
on behalf of Sarah's attempt to obtain a widow's pension, that his sister,
"Sereny Odell" and Marshall were married "about the year 1857," and that
Serena died 19 January 1869.) A new Pension Act was passed February 6,
1907; once more Marshall files a new declaration for benefits. On this
application Marshall gives his age as 74 years, his residence as "Goin,
Claiborne County, Tenn." He reports that "he...is the identical person
who was enrolled at Barbourville KY,...on the 6th day of March, 1862, as
a corporal, in Co. E 6th Regiment of Tenn. Inft." Earlier documents state
that Marshall enrolled as a private, and there is no evidence within the
file that he had been promoted to any other rank. His tombstone inscription
shows "Cpl. Marshall L. Odel." Some documents show that Marshall enrolled
at "Cumberlandford," Ky. It seems ironic that Marshall's younger brother,
Lacy O'Dell, died on 18 March 1862 at "Camp Cumberland Ford," Ky--just
12 days after Marshall's enlistment. Lacy was a member of the 2nd Tennessee
Volunteer Infantry and had been in the army since 25 October 1861. Could
Lacy have been influential in Marshall's enlistment? Is the timing of Marshall's
enlistment significant in relation to his younger brother's illness and
death? Could that illness have been the reason that Marshall chose to enroll
at Cumberland Ford at that time? Among the many affidavits on Marshall's
and Sarah's behalf is one from Elisha J. Odell, a resident of Mercer County,
IL on 14 Jan. 1908. Elisha (who appears as "E. Jordan O'Dell" on other
documents) swears that he is the brother of Marshall and that he was born
15 August 1827. He further states that Marshall was born sometime during
the year 1832. Elisha reports that there are no known family records of
their births, but that he had always been told that Marshall was about
5 years younger than he. He also reports that a sister was born between
the two brothers. (Elizabeth Mahala O'Dell, born about 1830). 21 Feb. 1908,
Marshall L. KINCAID takes oath that he and Marshall O'Dell have been intimate
friends from early childhood, and that his friend, Marshall, was born one
day after KINCAID. He gives his own birth as 10 April 1832; Marshall's
as 11 April 1832. Marshall L. O'Dell was dropped from the Pension Files
of the U.S. Department of Interior 04 OCT 1909. The "Drop Order and Report"
contained in Sarah's file states. "Sir: The name of the above-described
pensioner, who was last paid at $20 per month to Aug 4, 1909, has this
day been dropped from the roll of this agency...pensioner....died Sep.
4, 1909...". Marshall's widow, Sarah M. (EDWARDS) O'DELL, filed for widow's
pension 20 September 1909.</font>

<p><font size=-1>BIO: The "Old Speedwell Families, Revised" ref. gives
"Sarah" HOPPER as the wife of Marshall L. O'DELL (p. 279), but marriage
indexes and Bill HEINLE say "Serena" HOPPER. Marshall married Sarah EDWARDS
in 1869. Compiler suspects the grave near Marshall in the HOPPER Cemetery
is that of Sarah (EDWARDS) O'DELL, 1837-1926. Serena died young and is
probably buried in an unmarked grave in the same cemetery. There are some
very old stones that can not be fully read, including "D. O'DELL", who
is probably Marshall's son David. The birth date given for Serena here
has been calculated from her age as reported on the 1850 and 1860 census
records. Receipt of the Civil War Pension File for Marshall O'DELL brought
the first specific data on the death of Serena. In the file is an affidavit
from David HOPPER in 1909, during the time that Sarah was trying to get
a widow's pension. David, 80 years old, states that he is the brother of
"Surreny Odell the first wife of Marshall L. Odell..." David reports that
his sister and Odell were married "about 1857". Concerning his sister's
death, David testifies,"...She died on the 19 day of January 1869." In
another paragraph, he states, "I don't recollect that I was in the room
where she died but I saw her after she did die and saw her dead at the
grave and also saw her buried." In an update of his pension file in 1898,
Marshall reported that he had been previously married to "Surreny...(in)
Claiborne Co. Tenn" When asked to list the children he still had living
in August, 1898, along with their dates of birth, Marshall included "J.
Odell" (Jonathon, twin to David), born Sept 14, 1857; China, Aug 24, 1862
and William S., born April 14, 1866. Four other children were born after
Marshall's marriage to Sarah EDWARDS in 1869.</font>

<br><font size=-1>BIO: This son of Marshall L. O'DELL evidently died in
childhood. The dates are not legible on the tombstone. The only other documentation
found by compiler was the 1860 census record for Marshall's household.
A descendent of Jonathan (David's brother), Marjorie WALSH reports that
David was a twin to Jonathan, who was born 14 SEP 1857. Per the 1860 census,
David was 3 years of age; Jonathan was 2. In 1898, Marshall included in
his complying with the Pension Bureau's request for an update on his family's
vital data, a list of the birthdates of his children who were still living
at that time. David was not on that list, nor was he on the 1870 census.
In following Jonathan through the next census enumerations to compare his
age with what David's would have been had he survived, compiler found that
in 1870, Jonathan was reported to be 13 years of age; in 1880, he was recorded
as 21 and head of his own household. Compiler has found no other evidence
that Jonathan and David were twins (as of 01 May 1997).</font>

<br><font size=-1>BIO: Although Celia appears at the age of one year in
Marshall's home in 1860, she is not listed among his "living children"
when Marshall updated his data for the Office of Pensions in 1898. It is
possible that Celia did not survive until 1898; however, she was listed
on the 1870 census as being 11 years old. She was not in the household
in 1880, but could easily have been married and in her own home by that
time. The 1878 marriage for a Celia O'DELL and "Gorg GOIN" found among
the marriage indexes of Claiborne County has not been confirmed as being
the marriage of Celia, daughter of Marshall O'DELL. Compiler found a "G.
GOIN" household on the 1880 census, but the head of the household was 41
years of age, and his wife's name and age were given as "Mary A., 36."

<br><font size=-1>BIO: Compiler happened upon the grave site of China AUSMUS
while searching Claiborne County for the burial place of Bartlett and Elizabeth
QUILLEN O'DELL. The grave is located in a small cemetery om private property
near Speedwell. At the time, the maiden name of China was unknown. Research
of marriage indexes at the Claiborne County Library revealed this marriage
of China to Ben AUSMUS. Contact with Marjorie Walsh, desc. of Marshall
O'Dell, brought more confirmation that this was the daughter of Marshall
and his first wife, Serena Hopper. In 1898, Marshall O'Dell was instructed
to update his file with the Pension Bureau. Marshall lists China as his
second child who was still living at that time, and gives her date of birth
as 24 AUG 1862. This date agrees with the other sources. Examination of
the U.S. Census for Claiborne County in 1880, revealed China at the age
of 19 in Marshall O'DELL's household. This enumeration would have been
done slightly more than one year before China's marriage to Ben AUSMUS.
The data submitted to USgendex by Mark ASHBELL lists China first of the
three wives of Benj. AUSMUS; he also lists "Martha Adeline BEELER" as one
of the three, but does not have Elizabeth PROFFITT among the three women.
No dates are included in ASHBELL's data on these marriages.(Claiborne)
TN</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: Per the 1850 census for Claiborne Co., TN, Benjamin's
father, Benjamin, Sr., and his wife, Anna C. AUSMUS, resided very near
the households of Jordan and Bartlett O'DELL. Young Benjamin's age on that
record was "7". Ben married, evidently quite young, to Elizabeth PROFFITT.
After her death, he married Barbara HUNTER, whose family also lived in
the same commUnionty as the O'DELLs and the AUSMUSes. Barbara, too, died
early, and Ben married China O'DELL about one year after Barbara's death.
China, the daughter of Marshall O'DELL, was very young when she became
the wife of Ben AUSMUS. She, too, died very young. Although the USgendex
data re the birth of Benjamin AUSMUS is consistent with data copied from
his tombstone in Claiborne County, TN, the date of death appearing on the
tombstone is "September 1928", but on the USgendex entry, his date of death
is given as 31 MAY 1928, and the place of death is "Unionon County, TN".
Also, data researched by compiler indicates that China O'DELL was Benjamin's
third wife; the USgendex data lists China as first of three spouses. There
are no dates given for any of the three marriages, however, so the order
of the women's names may not be significant on ASHBELL's data.</font>

<b>Sarah
M. Edwards</b>, daughter of Jeptha Edwards, I. and Sarah Matilda Goforth,
who was born 16 Mar 1842 in Claiborne County, Tn. Sarah M. died on 10 Feb
1927 in Claiborne County, Tn.</font>
<p><font size=-1>BIO: The "Old Speedwell Families, Revised" ref. gives
the first wife of Marshall O'DELL as "Sarah HOPPER (1837-1926)", then on
p. 235 it states that Sarah EDWARDS married Marshall O'DELL. Marriage records
say the first wife was "Serena HOPPER". Compiler suspects that the Sarah
O'DELL (1837-1926) who is buried near Marshall's grave in the HOPPER cemetery
is Sarah EDWARDS, his second wife. Serena died about 1869 and is probably
buried in the same cemetery, but her grave was not found. Per Lawrence
EDWARDS' book, Sarah was the daughter of Jeptha EDWARDS, I (son of Spencer
EDWARDS and Katie RIDDLE). On her tombstone, Sarah's date of birth is given
as "1837", however in filing for increased pension benefits in 1916, Sarah
gave her birthdate as "March 16, 1842". This agrees with the age she gives
herself on the same form, "Seventy Four Years 5 mo. and 4 Days". On an
earlier form for the Bureau of Pensions in 1909, Sarah reported that she
was 67 years old; again, this agrees with the 1842 birthdate. This would
mean that Sarah was about 44 years old when her youngest child, Nancy B.,
was born in 1886 (as reported by Marshall in his Pension File documents).
Sarah's age was reported as 27 on the 1870 census; this would nearly agree
with the birthdate she gave for the pension application. Marshall O'DELL
served in the Union Army from March, 1862 until his discharge in March,
1865. Per his claims for Invalid Pension, he spent much of the time in
ill health. He filed claims and was granted military pension from about
1890 until his death in September, 1909. At that time, Sarah filed for
widow's pension and apparently received benefits until her death in 1927.
Among the people filing affidavits on her behalf were David HOPPER, brother
of Marshall's first wife, Serena, and M.C. KECK. Witnesses for Sarah and/or
these affiants included P.E. CHEATAM, F.N. CHEATAM, Eli KECK, Suda COLE,
J.H. ROUSE and S.O. BEASON. The "DROP-REPORT-PENSIONER" form in Sarah's
file reads; "Mar 10, 1927. The name of the above described pensioner who
was last paid at the rate of $30 per month to Feb 4, 1927 has this day
been dropped from the roll because of death Feb 4 1927". Pensioner is recorded
as "Sarah M. O'DELL", Goin, Tenn. Route #1". August 1996: Found on the
1850 Census for Claiborne County, TN at LDS Library, Arden, NC....Sarah
M. EDWARDS, the first child of Jeptha and Sarah M. EDWARDS. She was 7 years
old as of 11 OCT 1850. This would agree with the 1842 date of birth. Although
Jeptha's wife's name in the EDWARDS books was given as Matilda GOFORTH,
this census would hint that her name may be Sarah Matilda and that her
daughter was named for her.</font>

about 1870 in Tennessee.</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: Neither Ben O'DELL nor Marjorie WALSH (both desc.
of Marshall O'DELL) has included this child in Marshall's family group,
yet on the 1880 census, she is clearly classified as "daughter." Her age
is given as "10" when the census was enumerated, 15 June 1880. It is possible
that she may have been the child of Marshall's first wife, Serena, since
an exact birth date is not available. Serena died in 1869; depending on
when Elizabeth's birthday fell, she could have been born prior to Serena's
death and still be ten years of age in mid-June, 1880. It seems likely
that Elizabeth M. did not survive to adulthood since she is not mentioned
in any of the large amount of family data passed from Mrs. WALSH and Mr.
O'DELL. Elizabeth is noted as being unable to read or write, and compiler
wonders if she might have been sickly or handicapped in some way, but this
is only conjecture.</font>

was the first wife of Spencer EDWARDS, the son of McKendry EDWARDS. There
was no data for Martha Ann or for her husband provided in that book. Marjories
WALSH, in her article about the Bartlett O'DELL families, included Martha
Ann as one of the children of Marshall, Ms. WALSH's direct ancestor. Although
her father cited a specific birthdate for Martha Ann, her age as shown
on the 1880 census was "7". This would calculate to a year of birth of
1873 +/- a year.</font>

(Bartlett<sup>1</sup>) was born about 1836 in Claiborne County, Tn, and
on 15 Aug 1854 in Claiborne County, Tn, married <b>Sarah Ann "Sally" OVERBEY</b>,
daughter of Henry OVERBEY and Sylvania OVERBEY, who was born in 1830/1831
in Halifax?/Mecklen, Va.. William Lacy died on 18 Mar 1862 in Knox County,
Ky. Sarah Ann "Sally" died in Mar 1905 in (Unknown).</font>
<br><font size=-1>BIO: William Lacy O'DELL was evidently the last of 8
known children born to Bartlett H. and Elizabeth (QUILLEN) O'DELL. Names
and ages of William's siblings were originally provided by William J. HEINLE,
a descendent of William O'DELL's sister, Mary Pauline LAY. Birthdates have
been calculated as closely as possible from census records from 1850 except
where more recent data is available. Comments of witnesses in William's
Civil War Pension File indicate that William and his future wife, Sarah
OVERBEY had been acquainted, and were possibly neighbors as children. Ages,
calculated from census records, indicate that the couple was married very
early. William would have been only 18; Sarah was somewhat older than her
husband. The couple evidently left Claiborne Co., and spent a brief time
in Laurel Co., KY, where their 2nd child, John Henry, was born in 1857.
Data found in Laurel Co. shows that William's older brother, Jordan, and
his wife, Hannah, had moved to Laurel Co. by 1856. It is likely that William
and Sarah were visiting with or had gone there with Jordan and Hannah O'DELL.
By 1859, William and Sarah were again residing in Claiborne Co. and seemingly
remained there until William entered the Unionon Army. There is some question
as to the precise date of William's mustering in, but one document states
that he "enrolled NOV 18/61 at Camp Calvert, KY to serve 3 years..." William
was assigned to Company E, of the 2nd Regiment of the Tennessee Volunteer
Infantry. "Private William L. ODLE" died near Camp Cumberland Ford in Knox
Co., KY on 18 MAR 1862. He was one of the many young soldiers who died
of Typhoid Fever within just a few months of beginning military service.
It is of some interest to note that William's brother, Marshall L. O'DELL,
enlisted in the U.S. Army at Camp "Cumberlandford" only twelve days before
William died. This may indicate that Marshall had gone there, knowing that
his younger brother was gravely ill, and that he was present or in the
general vicinity at the time of William's death. It is not known, as of
JAN 1995, if William's remains were re- turned to the family in Claiborne
Co., or if he was buried near the military camp in Knox Co. No record has
been found, as of Feb. 1997, for his burial. Although his youngest son
was only 14 months of age when William died, his name was carried on through
the next two generations. William's youngest son, Isaac Lacey, named his
first son "William Lacey". William's second son, William Franklin, born
in 1859 also honored his father's memory by naming his first son "Lacy
Abner O'DELL". Compiler has documents which show three different dates
for the marriage of "Lacy" and Sarah Ann OVERBEY. An affidavit signed by
the minister who married the couple, William WILLIAMS, as well as a statement
signed by the Clerk of the Claiborne Co. Courts states that the record
had been lost, that there was an error in recording Sarah's middle name
and that the marriage was "solemnized" on 15 August 1854. One marriage
index at the Claiborne Co. Library shows 22 August 1854; another shows
28 August of that year. *********************** March, 1996: Hubert D.
O'DELL, grandson of William Lacy, loaned compiler the Family Record Sheets
from his mother's Bible. On these sheets, Virginia Margaret (PHELPS), the
wife of Frank O'DELL, had spelled her son's name as "Lacy." This child
was apparently named for his grandfather, so this may be an indication
of the family's traditional spelling of the name. Records concerning William
L. O'DELL vary; some spell his name "Lacey" and others "Lacy." ************************

<p><font size=-1>BIO: All reference sources agree that Sarah OVERBEY was
born in Virginia. Her son's marriage record in Book H, Laurel Co., KY,
specifies Halifax Co., VA. Data sent to compiler by Connie HERRING, citing
the book written by Paul OVERBEY, reports that she was born in 1831 in
Mecklenburg, rather than Halifax County, VA. "Sally" was enumerated in
the home of Henry and Sylvaney OVERBEY, Claiborne Co., TN Census, 1850.
Henry OVERBEY's name appears in the Civil War Pension File as a witness
for the widowed Sarah, but his relationship is not stated. Sarah's mother's
name appears as "Sylvania," "Sylvia" and "Sylvaney", depending upon the
document reviewed. Sarah's C.W. file states that "Sylvana" testifies that
she was present at the births of each of Sarah's children, but it does
not state that she is the mother of Sarah (OVERBEY) O'DELL. Finally in
September, 1997, compiler received evidence via Ms. HERRING, that confirms
Sarah as the child of Henry and Sylvania OVERBEY. Trusting the 1850-1880
census data as to names, ages and birth- places is questionable. Apparently,
neither of Sarah's parents could read or write. It would appear, however,
that the family moved from VA to NC about 1835, although they may have
returned to VA before moving to Claiborne Co., TN prior to Sarah's marriage
to William Lacey O'DELL in 1854. The data from Paul L. OVERBAY's book supports
compiler's assumptions. The following is an excerpt from an e-mail letter
to compiler from Ms. HERRING, 30 Aug. 1997: According to the book, Henry
&amp; Sylvania lived for a time in North Carolina, probably in Granville
Co., which is just south of Halifax Co and where some of the OVERBY land
was located ... They were back in Virginia, Mecklenburg or Halifax, when
Smith was born in 1834. Tax lists indicate they lived in Stokes County,
NC, from 1836 to 1840 and were listed there in the 1840 Census. Three children
were born there: Herod, John Calvin, and Christina. The next two ...were
born in Virginia...possibly Smyth Co. A Henry OVERBEY bought land there
in 1846 and deeded it back to the seller in 1856, after moving to Tennessee.
The census of 1850 found the family in Claiborne Co., TN ... Around 1865
they moved to Laurel Co., KY, living there until their deaths in the 1880s...</font>
<p><font size=-1>Sarah gives her age as of 22 AUG 1863, when she filed
for widow's/ minor child's pension as "34". Calculation indicates a birthdate
in 1829; this is one of four possibilities. There is also some conflict
on the exact date of Sarah's marriage to "Lacy" O'DELL. Documents in the
C.W. Pension File give the date as 15 August 1854; one marriage index in
the library at Tazewell, TN gives the date as 22 August 1854, the other
says 28 August of that year. Apparently William and Sarah left Claiborne
Co., TN for a brief period near the time of the birth of their second child,
John Henry, who was born in Laurel Co., KY in 1857. They returned to Claiborne
County, TN where the last two children, William and Isaac Lacey, were born
in 1859 and 1861, respectively. Isaac, the youngest, was thought to be
about 14 months old when his father died in a Unionon military camp in
March, 1862. (Two statements in Sarah's Widow's Pension File say that Isaac
was two months old when his father died.) About 1865, Sarah returned with
her 4 children to Laurel Co., KY. She resided near Laurel Bridge, KY until
her marriage to William A. PHELPS in 1874. After the marriage, the family
lived in the Bush area (Bush's Store P.O.) near London, KY. In 1875, William
PHELPS made application and was given guardianship of Sarah's two children
who were still under 16. This helped Sarah in her attempts to obtain the
minor-children's Civil War pension. After PHELP'S death Sarah applied again
and was granted her widow's pension from William O'DELL's military service.
In 1888, she and Nancy O'DELL, Lacey's sister, testified on behalf of Sylvania
OVERBEY as she applied for widow's Pension after Henry's OVERBEY's death.
At that time, Sarah gave her age as "53". The statement is made that both
Nancy and Sarah have known the OVERBY's "since 1850". This would seem to
negate Sarah's relationship to Sylvania but compiler suspects the statement
was made from Nancy's viewpoint and did not consider Sarah's relationship
to the couple. The "Pensioner Dropped" document found in O'DELL's Civil
War File gives Sarah OVERBY O'DELL's date of death as "MAR___1905." The
place of death was not given in that document. A great grandson wrote in
his unpublished family history, that Sarah died in southern INDIANA. The
correct place of death and the place of burial are not known by compiler
as of Jan. 1995. Her last recorded address with the Federal Pension Bureau
was Laurel Bridge, Laurel County, KY. Sarah was found as a "boarder" in
the home of Will Henry and Hannah JOHNSON on the 1900 census. Will Henry
was a brother to to Sarah's daughter- in-law, Mary (JOHNSON) O'DELL, wife
of John Henry "Bud." By 1910, at least three of Sarah's children had moved
to IN, first to Montgomery County, near Crawfordsville. It is possible
that Sarah was with one of the families at the time of her death, however,
compiler has been unsuccessful in finding any record of her death in Montgomery,
Vigo, or Fulton Countyies in IN or in Laurel County, KY. No burial site
has been found for her.</font>
