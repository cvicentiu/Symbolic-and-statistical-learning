<p>
In the past we have taken a pleasure excursion 
aboard a steamboat from Abbeville to the seashore.&nbsp; Now, before we learn about 
Dr. Edwards' life, we will be taking journeys with him by steamboats and trains 
from Abbeville to Morgan City, from New Orleans to New Iberia, and on horseback 
from New Iberia to Avery Island. The accounts of these trips were taken from Dr. 
Clarence Edwards' diary.&nbsp; He was only 15 years old when he recorded two of these 
trips. We'll learn more about his personal life as we continue this visit.&nbsp; For 
now, let's just say that C. J. Edwards came to Abbeville when his family moved 
here in 1876 and remained here until his death in 1920.</p>
<p>His daughter, the late Mathilde Edwards, loaned 
me her father's dairy in 1975, and I hand-copied it almost verbatim.&nbsp; I'm 
presenting these journeys for many reasons not the least of which is my being 
impressed by this man's intellect and general fund of information, and by his 
ability to express himself so well, even at the age of 15.</p>

[Diary courtesy Sheila and Wakeman Edwards Linscomb]</p>
<p>
Two of these trips took place before he moved to 
Abbeville.&nbsp; The third trip occurred in 1878, after he had been living in 
Abbeville for two years.&nbsp; That particular trip was from Abbeville to Morgan City 
by steamboat and from Morgan City to New Orleans by train.&nbsp; On his return trip 
to Abbeville,&nbsp; Dr. Edwards went up the Mississippi River past Baton Rouge, and 
ended up in New Iberia—all on one steamboat ride.</p>
<p>
From his account of his trip to what would one 
day be called Avery Island, we learn how salt was mined, processed, packaged and 
shipped during the Civil War.</p>
<p>
There are other interesting things to learn from 
his journeys, including how Edwards&nbsp; relieved a toothache, at least temporarily, 
and what it was like trying to sleep aboard a steamboat.&nbsp; We'll get an idea of 
which were the major plantations south of Abbeville, and an indication of their 
relative locations.&nbsp; LSU fans will learn that there was once a Tigerville, 
although it wasn't near Abbeville.</p>
<p>Now let's travel with C. J. Edwards, and 
discover some delightful insights into life in Southwest Louisiana in the 1870s.</p>

<p class="mt">Journeys of Dr. C. J. Edwards</p>
<p><b>Thursday 1-10-1878</b> - [In Abbeville] I got 
up early this a.m. and went to the warehouse to see if the boat had passed down.&nbsp;... About 10 
o'clock 
the clear whistle of the Mattie heralded the event of my departure.&nbsp; After 
bidding friends &amp; folks a hurried good-bye I got aboard the Mattie at King's Warehouse 
[middle of the block, between Port and Lafayette Streets, or lot 3 of Megret's 
portion of Abbeville] &amp; we steamed down the bayou, until we reached [A. G.] 
Maxwell's Warehouse [located about midway between Lafayette Street and the 
future site of the railroad depot] where it stopped to take on freight and my 
trunk.&nbsp; Jeff Lyons &amp; Davis Rawlins got aboard here.&nbsp;... Boat continued down the bayou 
until Mr. 
Area's place was reached where another landing was made to take on some sugar.&nbsp;... 
After a few minutes run, we reached Perry's Bridge passing the old home [the 
former home of Robert Perry and family, across from the town of Perry], the 
scene of O! so many things that are enshrined, as it were, in my heart [C. J. had 
lived there briefly with his parents and siblings].&nbsp;... Took on some freight and 
passed the bend, O'Bryan's sugar house &amp;c until Bagley's [was] reached.&nbsp; Here 
we took on 
a lot of sugar.&nbsp;... F[rank] Winston's place was the next stopping place where we laid some two hours and wooded up [loaded a supply of wood for steamboat's 
fuel].&nbsp; After the wood was all aboard, the boat put out from shore, swiftly 
passing Winston's Woods the scene of our July picnic.&nbsp;... We stopped at Putnam's to 
take on Mr. [J. Henry] Putnam, his two little boys &amp; mother-in-law (Mrs. 
Johnson).&nbsp; The passengers then on board were quite a crowd, Judge Kibbe, Putnam, Jeff (Lyons), 
3 
chaps from Pin Hook, a nice young fellow named Haven, a printer by trade, Davis 
&amp; myself.&nbsp; We passed Winston's, [Solomon] Wise and [H. H.] Bartels, the Bank 
place, &amp; others reaching Adrien's [probably Nunez] after dark where we put into shore to 
take him and his lady aboard.&nbsp; We passed over the bar without any difficulty and 
kept on our course until we reached Cote Blanche at about 10 o'clock where we took 
on a lot of freight and put of[f] some. ...</p>
<p><b>Jan 11-78</b> - Reaching Bayou Salé about 
2 
o'clock took on a lot of sugar here.&nbsp; A railroad runs out about 150 yards 
from 
shore on trestle work forming a safe though slow mode of conveying freight to and from 
the warehouse and boat.&nbsp;... After supper I was taken with a severe toothache 
&amp; at 
a late hour went to bed but to no purpose.&nbsp; I could not sleep &amp; after a 
good deal of suffering I hunted up some 
creosote &amp; put in my tooth which gave a little relief, but it soon returned 
with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>Morgan City was reached about half past 4 on 
the morning of Saturday Jan. 12th.</p>
<p><b>Saturday Jan. 12th </b>- Jeff and I knocked 
around town some.&nbsp; Called on Jim Brookshier and saw all that was to be seen.&nbsp;... We 
breakfasted on the boat.&nbsp; At about 12:30 noon the train arrived &amp; then we 
left.&nbsp;... At Tigerville a young lady got off.&nbsp; </p>
<p>[Stayed in New Orleans until Jan. 22nd.]</p>
<p><b>Tues. 22nd.</b> - [Got on board the Str. 
Fachon.]</p>
<p><b>Wed. 23rd Jan. '78</b> - A while after 
daybreak I crawled out of my nest &amp; changed again.&nbsp; We were then a piece 
above Plaquemine, having made in the neighborhood of 110 m's since leaving N.O.&nbsp; I 
set my plan to see Baton Rouge which we were nearing.&nbsp;... Only got a passing view 
of the city with its grand and stately old State House which rears its white 
towers up in sublime and striking grandeur, reminding one of an ancient castle 
of Europe. ...&nbsp; Was soon plowing up the Mississippi.&nbsp; We passed Waterloo and old 
Port Hudson, not much could be seen from the river at Port Hudson to indicate 
that it was once the scene of so much bloodshed and carnage.&nbsp; Bayou Sara was 
passed shortly after dinner.&nbsp; The boat stopped on the opposite side of the river 
&amp; Steve got off.&nbsp; He will take the ferry across the river &amp; take the stage 
for Jackson where he goes to attend Centenary College. ...</p>
<p><b>Thurs. 1-24-78</b> - When I awoke this 
morning it was to find myself in the Atchafalaya.&nbsp; After running a piece we took 
on 2 barges and passing along through this wild wooded country one found but 
little to see.&nbsp;... We stopped about dinner time at a landing &amp; took on a 
passenger - he was a swamper or lumberman.&nbsp; After passing through Chicot Pass 
&amp; 
Cypress Pass we reached Grand Lake &amp; soon were out upon it.&nbsp; I became quite 
familiar with the pilots Jim and Charlie Meyñun both 
of whom are nice chaps.&nbsp;... During the afternoon 
we passed the wreck of the old &quot;Queen of the West,&quot; a Confederate gunboat which 
was hard pressed by 5 or 6 Yankee gunboats and run aground.&nbsp; A shell 
entered her magazine&nbsp; and blew her &amp; a couple of hundred men into eternity.&nbsp; Her 
shaft sticks up out of the water &amp; seems to tell the sad tale that clings to the 
wreck.&nbsp; We come out of the Atchafalaya into the Teche above Pattersonville.&nbsp; 
Tied up the two barges here and went on down to Pattersonville where we arrived 
about 2:30 P. M.&nbsp; I mailed my letter &amp; looked around town a little.&nbsp;... We then 
went up the Teche passing many places of interest.&nbsp; Stopped at Marsh's 
&quot;Riccohoc&quot; plantation. ... We reached Franklin about 8 o'clock.&nbsp; I got off and looked about a 
bit.&nbsp; Saw the courthouse which seems to be a fine building.&nbsp; After discharging 
considerable freight we put out and continued on our course.&nbsp; [Arrived in New 
Iberia Friday morning 1-25th.]</p>
<p><b>1-25-78</b> - Got off .... met my old friend 
Embry Tolson at Blanchet's where he is warehouse clerk.&nbsp; Had my trunk put off 
at old Swaim's warehouse.&nbsp;... Took a little ramble thro' town meeting Troy Ervin who 
is learning blacksmithing with old Bill Caldwell.&nbsp; About 9 o'clock I left 
for grandpa's where I arrived pretty safe &amp; tired. ...</p>
<p><b>Sat. 1-26-78</b> - Tom [a cousin] and I went 
into town today [New Iberia].&nbsp; I looked around town in search of employment.&nbsp; I 
called at the <i>Courier</i> [C. J. had worked on the <i>Vermilion Banner</i> in 
Abbeville for a year] and <i>Sugar Bowl</i> offices.&nbsp;... My friend Arthur Escudier 
(formerly of the <i>Sugar Bowl</i>) is now on the <i>Courier</i>.&nbsp;... A young 
chap named Lea from New Orleans is in charge of the <i>Sugar Bowl </i>
just now but 
it won't last long.</p>
<p><b>Tues. Feb. 5, 1878</b> - Grandpa started for 
Abbeville after dinner. ...</p>
<p>
<b>Fri. Feb. 8, 1878</b> - I went to New Iberia 
&amp; brought home a pair of saddle 
bags full of clothes.&nbsp; Intend to start home tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Sat. Feb. 9</b> - ... I reached home at 4 o'clock 
and found all well. [On Sunday, February 10th he took part in a baseball game in 
Abbeville.]</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The next of C. J. Edwards' trips that I will 
discuss took place in 
1874, four years before the one we just took.&nbsp; Again, what amazes me is that C. 
J. was so perceptive and articulate when not quite 16 years old, when he made 
the following comments. He was still living in New Orleans at this time.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p><b>Saturday August 1st, 1874</b> - This was the 
day on which I was to leave for New Iberia.&nbsp; I arose at 4 o'clock, had 
breakfast at 5 and took the horse cars and went to Cor. Canal &amp; Baronne 
St.&nbsp; Went up Dauphine until I came to Orleans street.&nbsp; From there to 
the Morgan's 
Ferry &amp; got to the depot in Algiers all safe &amp; sound.&nbsp; Leaving the depot at 
eight o'clock, went along very slowly until we reached McDonoughville, when we 
went at a good speed.</p>
<p>GRETNA was the next place we stopped at.&nbsp; From 
here we went on a 'tear' until we reached JEFFERSON STATION which consists of a 
few shanties, a Catholic church &amp; graveyard.&nbsp; Col. Waggaman's plantation is 
here.&nbsp; From this station we leave the river [Mississippi River].&nbsp; Strike out a 
little westerly until we reach ST. CHARLES STATION where all to be seen is two 
little houses.&nbsp; From here to Butte&nbsp; I saw a good many rice fields.&nbsp; The rice 
was about two feet high &amp; some of it was ripe &amp; had fine heads.&nbsp; The next 
place - BUTTE STATION is a small place also half a dozen shanties, about.&nbsp; Next 
DES ALLEMANDS came in sight where about half of our passengers got off and took 
the steamer &quot;Bossier&quot; for Grand Isle.&nbsp; Bayou Des Allemands is about 100 yards 
wide and is crossed by a stile bridge which has a draw from here to a side 
track midway.&nbsp; This place &amp; Raceland is one vast prairie, as far as the eye can 
reach ... it is grass - grass.&nbsp; At this side track the train stopped and took on 10 
passengers, who got off a small horse-car with the name of 'Sabatier' which came 
up a small track from the direction of a plantation to our left.</p>
<p>RACELAND STATION is a little place like the 
others.&nbsp; At this point we went very slow, no faster that the 'dummies' on the 
Carrollton road, passing large gangs of laborers who were repairing the track 
&amp; roadbed.&nbsp; Between here &amp; Lafourche I saw my first alligator.&nbsp; His 
Excellency was about 7 feet long.</p>
<p>LAFOURCHE consists of a large station house &amp; 
telegraph office.&nbsp; The bayou is about 125 feet wide &amp; is crossed by a draw 
bridge, &amp; as soon as I crossed the bayou I saw the effects of the crevasse 
[referring to a break in the levee and flooding by the Mississippi River, I 
believe].&nbsp; The water had been about 3 feet high &amp; covered the floors of 
most all the houses.&nbsp; I saw no crops growing except 2 patches of sweet 
potatoes.&nbsp;... We went at the rate of about 7 miles an hour all the way to Bayou Boef.</p>
<p>TERREBONNE STATION is where the road's branch 
from Houma comes in and is a small place.&nbsp; A train from Houma was on the Houma 
Track.</p>
<p>CHACAHOULA STATION is a small station of no 
importance that I know of.&nbsp; At TIGERVILLE we stopped 10 minutes, took a flat 
train with laborers to Bayou Boef.&nbsp; A train passed us here.&nbsp; And from BAYOU BOEF 
STATION we made good time to Brashear [Morgan City] where we arrived at half 
past 12.</p>
<p>BRASHEAR is a little place about the size of &quot;Lincoln town&quot; 
&amp; about as beautiful (?), consisting of grog-shops and shanties.&nbsp; There were 
2 
steamers: The <i>Iberia</i> and <i>Flora</i> [The <i>Flora</i> sailed the Vermilion 
River at this time, while the <i>Iberia</i> traveled the Teche Bayou] and one 
steamship: The <i>Josephine</i> at the wharf.&nbsp; I got my valise and went aboard 
the &quot;<i>Iberia</i>,&quot; registered, and got Room 6.&nbsp; Had dinner about 1 o'clock.&nbsp; The fare 
was very good, &amp; the table crowded.&nbsp; When I went out on deck I saw that we had 
made great headway while I was at the table.&nbsp; We are now passing large 
plantations &amp; sugar houses, some of the latter in ruins.&nbsp; The cane is fine and 
5 feet high in some places.&nbsp; The water has been very high here.&nbsp; I saw houses 
on the East side of the Teche where the water had been between four and five 
feet high.&nbsp; The Teche is 200 yards wide at Brashear, but it gets narrow as we go 
up the bayou.</p>

At FRANKLIN the Teche is 150 feet wide &amp; has a 
couple of saw mills.&nbsp; I saw a steamboat called the &quot;Rebecca&quot; laying at one of 
the mills.&nbsp; We arrived at the wharf at 5 o'clock.&nbsp; We were detained about 15 
minutes by a raft which lay across the bayou about 200 yards from the wharf.&nbsp; 
Franklin is a small place &amp; is situated on a bluff.&nbsp; From here the bayou grows 
narrower &amp; more tortuous as we ascend.&nbsp; Passed the &quot;Orphans Home,&quot; at 8 
o'clock.&nbsp; A little before dark I 
made the acquaintance of a boy from Vermilionville named Samuel Locke Breaux who 
is a pleasant companion &amp; is returning home from a Catholic college at Ocean 
Springs [Mississippi].&nbsp; I &amp; Sam set up until half past 10 talking when we 
&quot;turned in&quot; &amp; went to sleep.&nbsp; I found my room to be very warm &amp; the noise 
of 
the wheel, the escaping steam, and the ringing of the bell made me pass a very 
unpleasant night.&nbsp; At 1 o'clock we were all woke up and told that it was NEW 
IBERIA and we were glad of it, for from Franklin we had progressed very slowly 
&amp; the boat would stop every 5 minutes &amp; back &amp; go ahead.&nbsp; We stopped at Serrett's House, when Mr. Serrett came aboard and asked for me saying that the 
old gentleman [grandfather Hollingsworth?] wanted me to stop at his house.&nbsp; I 
&amp; Samuel got a room together &amp; slept very well.&nbsp; At 5 o'clock I got up &amp; took a 
walk to the steamboat landing &amp; then down Main Street.&nbsp; At the market I saw a 
dilapidated old mud box of an engine, which was called the &quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; a 
name which it deserved.&nbsp; At 7 Sam left for Vermilionville in a buggy.&nbsp; I wrote a 
postal card to Pa informing him that all was well &amp; at 8 grandpa and Tom came 
for me.&nbsp; I paid my bill which was 50 cents &amp; left for &quot;Toledo Farme&quot; where I 
arrived at half past 10.&nbsp; Took lunch and after dinner Tom and I went to the 
Petit Anse which is a muddy stream &amp; I thought it was a pond but Tom told me 
that it was the bayou.&nbsp; It is between 2 and 4 feet deep.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p>This next trip that C. J. described is to Petite 
Anse Island which in time became known as Avery's Island and finally Avery 
Island.</p>
<p><b>Saturday August 29, 1874</b> - Today I left 
this morning in company with Tommy for Petite Anse Island.&nbsp; I saw the hills on 
the island before we got there.&nbsp; About 1 mile from the Island a road 
commences, it once was a plank road built by the Confederate Government—but it 
is a ruin now, its sleepers being all rotten, the road is covered with old 
planks &amp; it is a rough road.&nbsp; We crossed the bayou on a bridge..&nbsp; We saw about 
a dozen people fishing and crabbing in the bayou.&nbsp; We went right straight up the 
first hill we come to and got a good many rocks of various sizes and colors.&nbsp; 
From here we went to the salt mine.&nbsp; It is situated in a valley.&nbsp; The building 
is 100 feet long &amp; 30 wide.&nbsp; The tower in which the hoisting apparatus is 
located is 50 feet high.&nbsp; Every part of the building is put up roughly, the 
building being covered with long planks &amp; the tower ditto.&nbsp; They were at work 
putting up a new boiler &amp; consequently are not at work mining.&nbsp; I had a 
pleasant conversation with Mr. John Avery, [and] Mr. Kearney, both of whom were 
introduced to me at Mr. Dave Hayes.&nbsp; From Mr. Kearney I learned that during the 
war the way salt was got out was to clear off a place about 20 feet square, dig 
the earth out a couple of feet &amp; then blast the earth, &amp; finally the salt.&nbsp; 
I got a piece of salt and looked around at the affairs.&nbsp; The salt after it comes 
out of the mine, goes to the top of the tower &amp; is run out on a platform, put 
in a mill ground up coarsely and 3d quality; some of it is passed lower down 
into another mill &amp; ground into 2d quality salt.&nbsp; Some of this is passed into 
the next mill and ground into 1st quality and runs from the spout of the mill 
into sacks put on a platform scale, weighed &amp; sewed up and is ready for 
market.&nbsp; A little railroad runs from the mine to the Petite Anse, &amp; loads the 
salt onto a steamboat, schooner or any other craft.&nbsp; We left, and went to 
&quot;Prospect Hill.&quot;&nbsp; We crossed a ravine which lies about 200 yards from the mine.&nbsp; 
It is 12 feet deep &amp; five wide &amp; has a small rill running in it.&nbsp; A little 
while before we reached Prospect Hill&nbsp; I took a headache and when we reached its 
summit I felt badly, but could not help admiring the gorgeous beauty, and 
sublime magni[fi]cence &amp; grandeur of my birds eye view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israelites from Pisgah's summit 
could not have beheld a more enrapturing &amp; soul stirring view.&nbsp; I thought of 
&quot;Him who holds the earth &amp; seas in the hollow of his hand.&quot;&nbsp; We stood on the 
highest part of the hill—a little knoll that only three horses could stand 
on—and viewed the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Northeast lay the town of New Iberia and Petite 
Anse prairie.&nbsp; To the east it was smoky and raining.&nbsp; To the South was the Gulf, 
&amp; we saw what I supposed to be the smoke of some steamship.&nbsp; To the Southwest 
lay the placid, blue waters of Vermilion Bay where it was raining also.&nbsp; To 
the West lay Prairie Gregg [Grieg?].&nbsp; In the North it was raining.&nbsp; The Hill is 500 
feet high I guess, and is of a gradual ascent, &amp; is formed of red clay.&nbsp; The 
Island is a beautiful spot &amp; although the hills are poor the valleys are 
fertile.&nbsp; When I reached home I had a fever took Quinine &amp; pills, that day 
&amp; 
next &amp; got well shortly.</p>
<p>[I found that trip to have been a great peek at 
Avery Island over a century ago.&nbsp; Now, let's visit with C. J. Edwards and get to 
know him better]</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p>When 17-year-old Clarence Jeptha Edwards arrived 
in Abbeville in 1876, he was underwhelmed.&nbsp; He was not happy with our town, but 
then why should he have been?&nbsp; He had lived in the Carrollton area of New 
Orleans, an area which had been a town that had been annexed by New Orleans in 
the 1850s.&nbsp; It was difficult for him to leave his friends, relatives, and many 
fond experiences in Carrollton proper, and in New Orleans in general.&nbsp; He had to 
&quot;bid farewell to the dearest spot of earth to me...&quot;</p>
<p>C. J. left New Orleans to come to a relatively 
isolated town, to a town so small that if someone were hammering, he could be 
heard throughout the corporate limits.&nbsp; C. J. gave up a city with scores of 
stores with vast selections of everything from groceries and clothing to patent 
medicines and hardware.&nbsp; There were doctors and dentists throughout the city, 
while in Abbeville one had to depend on traveling dentists who came to town 
infrequently for only a few days at a time.&nbsp; Our doctors were more numerous than 
our dentists, and they lived in Abbeville.&nbsp; Edwards left New Orleans with its 
unending flow of people coming from and going to other parts of the world.&nbsp; New 
Orleans was a trading center for everything from crops to international 
finances.&nbsp; Abbeville had no banks until the 1890s.&nbsp; Money supplies trickled 
through the fingers and coffers of the more successful merchants and 
entrepreneurs in Abbeville.</p>
<p>New Orleans provided public transportation 
through rail systems and &quot;horse cars.&quot;&nbsp; If someone wanted to leave town, there 
were many modes of travel including trains, steamboats, schooners and other 
sailing vessels.&nbsp; Abbeville's modes were limited to steamboats that left town 
once or twice a week; rough-riding stagecoaches, horseback, and other 
horse-drawn vehicles.</p>
<p>Clarence, who had been and would continue to be 
associated with journalism most of his life, left a city that published dozens 
of newspapers in many languages for a one-newspaper town.&nbsp; For a short while, he 
and his father, Judge W. W. Edwards would attempt to correct this dearth of 
newspapers and would compete with the <i>Meridional </i>only to be beaten by, 
and won over by Abbeville's longest existing newspaper.&nbsp; But then, we're getting 
ahead of ourselves. </p>
<p>My belabored point is that C. J. Edwards had 
good cause not to be impressed when he arrived in Abbeville on board the Mattie, 
on May 16, 1876.&nbsp; For fear of violating his descendants' trust, I didn't record 
his initial impressions about Abbeville.&nbsp; Now, over twenty years later, I'm 
sorry I didn't copy his exact words from his diary, if only for my own benefit.</p>
<p>From the &quot;foot of St. Ann,&quot; he crossed the 
Mississippi on the steamer &quot;Sarah&quot; to get to the depot.&nbsp; For part of the trip to 
Morgan City, this adolescent had the privilege of riding &quot;on the locomotive with 
the engineers.&quot;&nbsp; Following a 3-hour layover in Morgan City, C. J. boarded the 
Mattie, the same steamboat that had transported his parents and younger brother 
and sister to Abbeville a few months earlier.&nbsp; The Edwards family had been lured 
here, I believe, by W. F. Area, Gus Godchaux's father-in-law to-be.</p>
<p>Leaving Morgan City around 3 p.m. on Monday May 
15, 1876, the Mattie and C. J. arrived &quot;just below&quot; Abbeville a little after 10 
p.m. on May 16th.&nbsp; Naturally, there must have been numerous stops along the way 
up the Vermilion River to drop off supplies and passengers at various 
plantations below Abbeville.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Clarence had come to join his family.&nbsp; Who were 
his family members?&nbsp; &quot;Pa&quot; was Wakeman Wakeman Edwards who had moved here to 
practice law.&nbsp; In 1889, W. W. Edwards was appointed district judge to fill the 
unexpired term of Judge C. Debaillon.&nbsp; &quot;Ma&quot; was Martha Hollingsworth.&nbsp; We'll 
visit W. W. Edwards and his wife at a later date.</p>

<p>As you may recall from our trips with C. J. on 
his journeys, he had visited his maternal grandparents near New Iberia at 
&quot;Toledo Farme.&quot;&nbsp; The Hollingsworths had settled there after moving from 
Mississippi.</p>
<p>Two years after the Edwards family had moved to 
Abbeville, Jeptha Hollingsworth, the grandfather from whom C. J. got his middle 
name, died.&nbsp; The following excerpt from C. J.'s diary describes this death from 
Clarence's own experience and depicts another slice of life about which we know 
little.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p>&quot;This morning [05-12-1878] Joe Dooley rode up 
&amp; brought us the mournful news of my grandfather's death.&nbsp;... I borrowed Frank 
Lyons' horse &amp; went after the horses &amp; after a long ride succeeded in 
getting them safely home.&nbsp; Pa borrowed Mr. Area's buggy &amp; after dinner he and 
mother started for my dear grandfather's late residence.&quot;&nbsp; It rained most of the 
following day.&nbsp; On Tuesday May 14th, &quot;Pa and Ma arrived safely this 
evening &amp; could only confirm the 
sad news of Sunday.&nbsp; Grandpa died suddenly of heart disease at about 6 
o'clock 
Sunday morning.&nbsp; He had spent the day before in answering letters &amp; never wrote better 
in his life.&nbsp;... The funeral which took place yesterday evening was well attended, 
but owing to the heavy rain, no ladies could get to the grave.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="awillrul.gif" width="532" height="10"></p>
<p>I enjoyed the descriptions of what occurred, but 
certainly not his grandfather's death.&nbsp; How far did C. J. have to ride and where 
did he go for the horses?&nbsp; If his parents left after supper and traveled by 
buggy, it must have been dark before they arrived at Toledo Farme, somewhere to 
the west of New Iberia.&nbsp; The trip must have been bumpy, as anyone who has ever 
ridden in a buggy can attest to.&nbsp; And how much light could their lantern have 
thrown on the dark, rutty road?&nbsp; Did the rain prevent the ladies from going to 
the grave because of a lack of rain gear?&nbsp; I'm guessing that the floor-length 
dresses and the delicate footwear prevented them from sloshing through the mud.</p>
<p>Getting back to Clarence's family members, he 
had one sister and a brother.&nbsp; His sister was Lizzie [Elizabeth?].&nbsp; 
Her status, like that of most women until lately, was gauged by the success and 
status of her husband.&nbsp; Therefore, I must tell you about George B. Petty, 
her husband, who was about a year younger than Clarence.&nbsp; George had come 
to Abbeville from Mississippi in time to be included in the 1880 census of 
Vermilion Parish.&nbsp; By 1887, he had a &quot;photograph gallery&quot; on the second 
floor of a building on the west side of Main St. across from the Catholic 
church.&nbsp; It was Mr. Petty who took the photo&nbsp; of our newly constructed 
courthouse with those daring men perched on the building's tower in January 
1891.&nbsp; He did not remain long as a photographer in Abbeville.&nbsp; In fact 
he had opened a photo gallery above the Moss Pharmacy in Lafayette in 1889, so 
he had to have made a special trip to Abbeville to photograph the courthouse.</p>
<p>In December 1890, Petty returned to Abbeville to 
marry Lizzie Edwards.&nbsp; The wedding ceremony took place at Grey Friars, her 
parents home which still stands on North State Street.&nbsp; Lizzie's rooms had been 
in the northern portion of this home.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Judge W. W. Edwards didn't 
indicate in his diary on which floor her rooms were located.&nbsp; W. W. wrote, 
&quot;Owing to the difficulty of getting servants, no one was invited but a few 
relatives.&quot;&nbsp; Lizzie's leaving home, was seemingly quite depressing to her 
father, because it &quot;emptied the nest&quot; of all of his children.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lizzie Edwards' appearance in the local work 
force was shortly before her marriage.&nbsp; In May 1889 she was hired to teach an 
all-girls' school for which many parents had petitioned.&nbsp; These concerned 
parents must not have wanted their daughters attending any school where wild, 
bare footed, uncouth boys might have a negative influence on the girls.&nbsp; In 
November 1890, a month before her wedding, Lizzie resigned as the teacher and 
was replaced by Mary Lou Kibbe.</p>

<p>It is my good fortune to have been given, by 
some kind Abbevillians, photographs that bear the names of Petty's studios in 
Abbeville, Lafayette, and even Natchitoches.&nbsp; I continue to search for a photo 
with the name of his &quot;Petty's Portrait Studio&quot; in Chicago to complete this 
collection.</p>
<p>If W. W. and Martha were upset when Lizzie moved 
to Lafayette, they must have been devastated when she and George moved to the 
Windy City in 1892!&nbsp; Fortunately for all, Lizzie made frequent visits to 
Abbeville, even after her two children, Bessie and George, were born.</p>
<p>Geo. Petty was successful in his businesses.&nbsp; I 
make this statement based on the fact that in June 1913, Mrs. Petty went to 
Europe with her two children.&nbsp; By January 1914, they were living in an apartment 
in Paris after having lived for several months in London.&nbsp; Bessie had graduated 
from Northwestern University shortly before they sailed to Europe.&nbsp; In January 
1914, she was attending lectures at the Sorbonne.&nbsp; Her brother George was 
studying at the Julien Academy in Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp; He went on to become famous for his 
sketches of what became known as the &quot;Petty Girls&quot;—pinup girls.&nbsp; My recollection 
of these drawings is that they were quite risqué to a teenage boy like myself in 
the days of innocence, before the term &quot;X-rated&quot; had been coined, and before TV 
soaps had begun showing all.</p>
<p>When George B. Petty died in 1916, he was no 
longer a photographer , but rather an art dealer, still located in Chicago.&nbsp; It 
may have been in this capacity that his apparent wealth was made.</p>
<p>C. J.’s brother, William Pierrepont Edwards, was 
born in 1867.&nbsp; He followed in his father's footsteps in more ways than one. W. 
P. Edwards, as he was referred to in the <i>Meridional</i>, graduated from the 
Tulane Law Department in 1891, after having attended Tulane High School in 1887 
and 1888.&nbsp; W. P. was sworn in as a district judge on December 12, 1904.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike 
his father, however, he served considerably longer as judge.&nbsp; We'll visit more 
with W. P. Edwards at a later time.&nbsp; I will point out, as many of you know, that 
some of W. P. Edwards' descendants continue to follow his honored profession.</p>

<p>
Returning to C. J. Edwards, he was a man who, 
like many of the other individuals that we have visited, lived through so many 
events that we've focused on for the past year, and he ate and sweated and lived 
with most of these Abbevillians.&nbsp; C. J. watched in horror and worked in 
desperation as so many of our buildings were destroyed by fire, including the 
courthouse in 1885.&nbsp; He was one of the men on a committee that delicately 
handled the documents that survived the courthouse fire.&nbsp; These men labeled and 
separated the documents into various categories in which they are to be found 
today, even though they are read only on microfilm.&nbsp; Because of their historical 
significance, I feel lucky to have handled these scorched legal documents 
themselves, before they were microfilmed.&nbsp; I had the occasion to do so when I&nbsp; 
began my research in the early 1970s into the history of Abbeville .&nbsp; There is&nbsp; 
something more satisfying about handling the delicate, crumbling originals that 
is not equaled by reading them on microfilm.</p>
<p>C. J. Edwards, in 1882, was among the select few 
who organized our first fire-fighting unit, the Abbeville Fire Co. No. 1, a 
volunteer group.&nbsp; In 1889, he was among another group of concerned citizens who 
formed the Protector Fire Co. No. 2 &quot;for the protection of life and property 
from fire in Abbeville.&quot;&nbsp; In June 1890, C. J. Edwards was elected president of 
that fire company.&nbsp; C. J. brought to Abbeville some fire-fighting training from 
New Orleans, where, at the age of 15, he had been a member of the Hall 
Independent Fire Co. No. 2.&nbsp; In fact, the day before he set out on his trip to 
Abbeville, young C. J. went to the &quot;Engine house&quot; to help wash the fire engine 
for his last time.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards experienced all the fickleness and 
extremes of Abbeville's weather from floods to droughts, from the stifling heat 
of summer to the occasional snows of winter.&nbsp; On January 1, 1877, he wrote, 
&quot;When I arose I found to my surprise the doorway of my bedroom had blown open 
during the night and filled with snow.&quot;&nbsp; What a delightful scene he captured for 
us!&nbsp; Imagine how cold it must have been inside his room with snow piling up in 
the doorway.&nbsp; Because the freezing cold did not awaken him, it suggests to me he 
was accustomed to sleeping in a cold bedroom, probably under several heavy 
quilts probably stuffed with cotton grown in the area, quilts for which we would 
pay premium prices today.&nbsp; Recalling my own experiences with such quilts, the 
total weight of several quilts was similar to those lead aprons used in 
dentist's offices whenever X-rays are taken.&nbsp; Moving around under those quilts 
required considerable resolve.</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards, as a coroner, and as acting 
sheriff, knew first-hand how humanity sometimes turns on itself.&nbsp; After the 
sudden death of Sheriff J. Oscar Hebert on January 26, 1905, Dr. Edwards, in his 
capacity as coroner, acted as sheriff until the vacancy was filled.&nbsp; He was 
sheriff in deed as well as in name, as is illustrated by the following 
incident.&nbsp; In late February 1905, Dr. Edwards brought two prisoners, who had 
recently been sentenced to the penitentiary, to Baton Rouge.&nbsp; Imagine, our 
coroner and local physician transporting these prisoners.&nbsp; Surely, he had a 
pistol strapped to his leg, or a rifle in his arms. How strange it must have 
been for a man dedicated to saving lives to be put in such a position wherein he 
might have had to shoot someone.&nbsp; In March 1912, he signed a Sheriff Sale's 
notice in the <i>Meridional </i>as &quot;coroner and acting Sheriff.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards wrote in his diary about a murder 
that took place only two months after he had moved to Abbeville.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheriff 
Granville B. Shaw, Constable Geo. Lyons, N.C. Young and C. J. were standing on 
the corner in front of J. T. Labit's building across from Magdalen Square on 
July 26, 1876. Suddenly the stillness of the dusty, hot evening was torn apart 
by a &quot;double barreled shot gun in the direction of the Brick Hotel&quot; [Veranda 
Hotel].&nbsp; A local lawyer had walked up to the victim and shot him.&nbsp; By the time 
C. J. and the others got to this hotel, the deceased was &quot;laying under the 
gallery shed [of the hotel] with a hole in the head and dead as a stone.&quot;&nbsp; The 
particulars of this incident will be presented in an upcoming article on crime.</p>
<p>By now, even those who never heard of him know 
that C. J. became a physician.&nbsp; However, Dr. Edwards had had many jobs before 
obtaining his M.D. degree.&nbsp; These varied jobs seem to mirror the fact that he 
would play multiple roles in later years.&nbsp; In 1877, while living in Abbeville, 
C. J. hired out as a field hand; he planted corn, worked at a sugar mill, and 
even cut cane.</p>
<p>In 1878, he began a long association with A. D. 
Martin, who was a merchant, moss collar manufacturer and one of Abbeville's 
mayors. C. J. worked as a clerk, and according to his own diary seems to have 
been in charge of Mr. Martin's store whenever Martin had to leave town.&nbsp; It is 
possible, although C. J. never mentioned it, that he even worked in Martin's 
moss collar factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Clarence left to attend medical lectures in 1881, he 
was employed by Mr. Martin.</p>
<p>After attending his first series of medical 
lectures, C. J. returned to Abbeville and worked at other jobs.&nbsp; Briefly, in 
late 1881, he and his cousin from New Iberia worked at the &quot;Salt Mines.&quot;&nbsp; At 
that time there were only the mines on Avery Island;&nbsp; the salt dome on Jefferson 
Island wouldn't be discovered until about 1895.&nbsp; Tom, his cousin, worked as a 
driller;&nbsp; C. J. worked at&nbsp; &quot;switching&quot; in the mines.&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 1881, before 
resuming clerking at Martin's, C. J. went to New Iberia where he worked briefly 
at &quot;Levy's&quot; for &quot;$25 a month and board.&quot;&nbsp; Martin then offered him a better deal, 
so C. J. returned to Abbeville.&nbsp; He left New Iberia on the stagecoach at 8:30 
a.m.; Abbeville wasn't reached until 3:30 p.m., because the roads were 
&quot;terrible.&quot;&nbsp; Some might think that some of the delay was caused by stops in 
numerous towns along the way.&nbsp; However, most , if not all of the towns between 
here and New Iberia, didn't spring up until the railroad came through in 1892.&nbsp; 
At any rate, thank goodness it doesn't take that long today!</p>
<p>With authority from the school board, C. J. had 
a school built in the fourth ward, and for a short time he taught at that 
school.&nbsp; In fact, it closed during his absence a short time later, when he left 
for additional medical studies.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, the sphere of employment that 
addicted him the most, besides his medical profession, was that of journalism.&nbsp; 
While still living in New Orleans, C. J. had been employed at the <i>State 
Register.</i>&nbsp; When he died in 1920, Dr. Edwards was editor and manager of our<i> 
Meridional.</i>&nbsp; During most of his time in Abbeville, Dr. Edwards was 
associated with newspapers.</p>
<p>The first weekly paper he worked on in Abbeville 
was the <i>Vermilion Banner</i>.&nbsp; Soon after arriving in Abbeville, his father, 
W. W. Edwards, purchased the &quot;<i>Terrebonne Banner</i> office of Houma, La, and 
a lot of paper, etc. in New Orleans.&quot;&nbsp; When C. J. unpacked the boxes, he 
reported that &quot;Judging from the specimens I found in the boxes the Terrebonne 
rats are whoppers.&quot;&nbsp; The <i>Vermilion Banner's</i> office was located, as best 
as I can determine, on the east side of Main Street, near Sol Wise's store.
</p>
<p>According to the diary, C. J. did most, if not 
all of the printing of the newspaper and other printing jobs, such as the 
printing of briefs for lawyers, and election tickets [ballots] for the 
&quot;Presidential, State and Parochial Election&quot; on November 6, 1876.&nbsp; Rutherford B. 
Hayes was elected president in that election; I don't know how Abbevillians 
voted, however.</p>
<p>Two comments that C. J. made about his 
importance to the running of the newspaper, deserve to be quoted.&nbsp; On 
12-30-1876, he wrote, &quot;No <i>Banner</i> issued today as the printers i.e. myself 
took a holiday.&quot;&nbsp; Six months later, when W. W. was to be gone for a week, C. J. 
wrote, &quot;I will run the <i>Banner </i>during his absence as I do when he is 
here.&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>Banner </i>survived only one year and was 
last printed on August 11, 1877.&nbsp; An article clipped out of a New Orleans 
newspaper and pasted in C. J. Edwards' diary gave this explanation for the <i>
Vermilion Banner's</i> short existence: &quot;Delinquent subscribers and the 
indifference of businessmen.&quot; </p>
<p>When C. J. set up the last edition of the 
newspaper, a number of people were on hand to mourn the demise of the paper.&nbsp; 
However, C. J. named only &quot;the Misses Area,&quot; Kate and Mary, daughters of Mr. and 
Mrs. W. F. Area.&nbsp; He had written in the <i>Banner</i>—I assume that it was he, a 
week or so before the end of this newspaper—that, &quot;Misses Kate and Mary Area 
placed us under lasting obligations for a couple of baskets of the most 
delicious peaches grown upon their father's place...&quot;&nbsp; The item went on to 
describe the peaches as being &quot;some 7, 8, 9, and 10 inches in circumference,&quot; 
and as being &quot;the finest we have seen in the State.&quot;&nbsp; I wonder if his obvious 
feelings for these young women somehow clouded his judgment in this matter.</p>
<p>In his first years in Abbeville, C. J. was 
captivated by several local young maidens.&nbsp; He mentioned, I'm saying without 
counting, Kate Area the most.&nbsp; After his first glimpse of her aboard the Mattie, 
as it sailed past Perry's Bridge, where he lived awhile in 1877, he wrote about 
her several times.&nbsp; On one such occasion, C. J. indicated much interest in her 
at a croquet game at Mr. A. G. Maxwell's home.</p>
<p>C. J. mentioned interest also in Misses Mary 
Area, Emma Eldredge, Annie Tolson, and Mary Lyons.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his diary 
ended in 1882 so we have no account of his courting, his falling in love with, 
or marrying his wife, Miss Kate Young.</p>

<p>C. J. and Kate were married at her parents' home 
on October 7, 1887, some four and a half years after he received his &quot;M.D. 
diploma.&quot;&nbsp; Her parents were Dr. and Mrs. F. D. Young.&nbsp; As you may recall, Kate's 
mother was Mary Mathilde Guegnon, daughter of <a href="http://www.vermilionhistorical.com/features/Biographies/e_i_guegnon.htm">E. I. Guégnon</a>, founder of the <i>
Meridional</i>, the very newspaper with which Dr. C. J. Edwards would become 
inextricably bound.</p>
<p>Not only did his diary end in 1882, he also 
wrote nothing between 1878 and 1881 leaving a huge gap in our knowledge of C. 
J.’s life and a loss of numerous scenes of insight about Abbeville as well.&nbsp; As 
noted in a previous article, it was his future brother-in-law, N. C. Young, who 
convinced C. J. to become a physician.&nbsp; For some period of time, unknown to me, 
Clarence had studied and read in the office of Drs. F. D. Young and W. G. Kibbe.
</p>
<p>In February 1881, at the age of 22, and without 
any formal undergraduate education, C. J. left for Louisville, Kentucky to 
attend &quot;a course of medical lectures.&quot; By August 27, 1881, he had finished the 
course, had visited some relatives in Indiana, and had returned to Abbeville.&nbsp; 
It was during the next few months that he taught school, and had clerked at Mr. 
Martin's.&nbsp; In November 1882, he returned to Louisville where on February 27, 
1883, only three months later, C. J. Edwards was &quot;awarded his M.D. diploma&quot; from 
the Kentucky School of Medicine.&nbsp; He didn't attend school long to have been 
awarded his degree.&nbsp; Perhaps he was brilliant; also quite probable was that 
there was much, much less to learn in the practice of medicine over a century 
ago. </p>
<p>Anyway, C. J. had become Dr. C. J. Edwards, and 
he was ready to set out his shingle.&nbsp; Apparently he began his practice in 
Arkansas, the state where he was born in 1858.</p>
<p>In 1884, Dr. Edwards returned to Abbeville.&nbsp; He 
then went to New Iberia to start a new practice.&nbsp; By May 1885, he was back in 
Abbeville, in partnership with <a href="http://www.vermilionhistorical.com/features/Biographies/dr_f_f_young.htm">Dr. F. F. Young</a>, one of his future 
brothers-in-law.&nbsp; Their office was on South Street across from Magdalen Square.&nbsp; 
A year later, Dr. Robert J. Young, yet another future brother-in-law, entered 
into a partnership with them.&nbsp; These doctors would eventually establish separate 
practices in Abbeville.</p>
<p>In 1892, Drs. C. J. Edwards and R. J. Young 
bought N. C. Young's drugstore on the corner of Port (Père Mégret) and Washington 
Streets, across from Magdalen Square. &nbsp;This drugstore became known as the Young 
&amp; Edwards Drugstore.&nbsp; Here too, the post office was located for awhile.&nbsp; By 
1894, Abbevillians could drink at the soda fountain while waiting for their 
prescriptions to be filled.&nbsp; They could also pick up their mail here.&nbsp; Remember, 
at the time, one could pick up one's mail only at the post office; there was no 
home delivery service.&nbsp; So, while there were other drugstores and other soda 
fountains around town, the combination of these two and the post office must 
have made this one popular spot in Abbeville.</p>
<p>In 1894, Dr. Edwards was appointed by Governor 
Foster to a board to assist in the control of the new State Leper (Hansen's 
Disease) Hospital.&nbsp; I'm uncertain if this hospital was located at its present 
site in Carville.&nbsp; Dr. C. J. Edwards remained on this board many years.</p>
<p>In yet another aside, let me point out that 
Governor Foster won the governorship in 1892 when the major election issue was 
the corrupt state lottery.&nbsp; Governor Foster, and the <i>Meridional</i>, of which 
Dr. Edwards was part owner, were anti-lottery. I am not implying that Dr. 
Edwards' position on the lottery issue was the reason that he was appointed to 
this health board.&nbsp; I'm noting only an interesting association, and feel that in 
this state-wide political battle, Dr. Edwards and his newspaper were on the 
winning side.</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards was apparently appointed parish 
coroner in 1897 to fill the unexpired term of the late Dr. P. Lucius LeBlanc.&nbsp; 
In 1900, having no opponent, Edwards was &quot;reelected.&quot;&nbsp; In June 1903, he, as 
coroner, and Sheriff J. Oscar Hebert traveled to Gueydan &quot;by team&quot; (in some sort 
of horse-drawn vehicle) to investigate a fatal shooting.&nbsp; I don't know about the 
interim years, but in 1912, Dr. Edwards was coroner.</p>
<p>In July 1905, the town council appointed Drs. 
Edwards, M. R. Cushman, and Messrs. L. O. Broussard, and D. L. McPherson as a 
Board of Health, because of another Yellow Fever Epidemic in New Orleans.&nbsp; This 
board declared the last Yellow Fever quarantine for Abbeville.&nbsp; The Southern 
Pacific railroad was instructed not to sell any tickets to Abbeville from any 
points east of New Iberia during the duration of this quarantine. </p>
<p>By 1905, mosquitoes were known to be the 
transmitters of Yellow Fever.&nbsp; Therefore, Abbevillians were &quot;instructed to pour 
at least two cups of coal oil in every cistern, stagnant pool or pond... and to 
use lime or crude carbolic acid in and around water closets, sinks or 
cesspools.&quot;&nbsp; This occurred shortly before a municipal water system had been 
developed, so imagine all those mosquito-producing outhouses!&nbsp; And how tasty 
could that cistern water, spiked with coal oil, have been? Luckily Abbeville was 
spared the scourge of Yellow Fever, this time.</p>
<p>In 1915, Dr. Edwards was elected President of 
the Parish Medical Society; he was also elected as a delegate to the State 
Medical Society.&nbsp; By this time, one of his sons, Dr. H. G. F. Edwards was a 
member of this society also.&nbsp; The son was coroner in 1914.</p>

<p>
Speaking of his son, let's look at Dr. C. J. 
Edwards' family.&nbsp; As we noted, he and Kate Young married on October 7, 1887.&nbsp; By 
this time he was in a partnership with two of her brothers, Drs. F. F. Young and 
R. J. Young.&nbsp; Dr. Edwards had celebrated his 29th birthday only four days before 
the wedding.&nbsp; I don't know where this couple's home was initially.&nbsp; However, 
they moved into their &quot;new&quot; house &quot;adjoining the Convent,&quot; sometime in late 
1891.&nbsp; This large, beautiful home can still be seen today.&nbsp; It sits splendidly, 
snuggled amid all sorts of trees, flowers and other plants, gracing the north 
side of the <i>Meridional's </i>office and stands like a monument to&nbsp; the 
genteel way of life which a few of our ancestors enjoyed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We almost missed the opportunity to enjoy its 
beauty.&nbsp; In April 1914, a small blaze &quot;in the kitchen roof&quot; tried to destroy 
this home.&nbsp; However, it was extinguished quickly.&nbsp; I wonder if there is evidence 
of this fire in the attic today.</p>
<p>Kate and Clarence had four sons according to 
Miss Mathilde Edwards, their only surviving daughter, and according to Dr. 
Edwards' obituaries.&nbsp; They were Dr. Harold, the oldest child, who was born in 
1888; Mark Hollingsworth (Holly); Floyd D.; and Wakeman Wakeman.&nbsp; The obit 
listed the latter as W. W. Edwards, Jr.&nbsp; It is interesting to me that both 
sources did not mention a sixth child—Henry Edwards.&nbsp; Perhaps his short life and 
early death were so painful that Ms. Mathilde Edwards blocked it out of her 
mind.&nbsp; Perhaps he was not mentioned because he had been dead almost 60 years 
when I spoke to Ms. Edwards in 1975.</p>
<p>It is August 20, 1997, almost two years since 
this article appeared in the<i> Meridional.</i>&nbsp; It was I who had blocked the 
discussion of Henry out of my mind.&nbsp; I just reviewed a taped interview that I 
had with Ms. Edwards and she did tell me about him.&nbsp; However, the obituaries of 
Dr. Edwards did not mention Henry.&nbsp; Since it was so many years since Henry had 
died, Ms. Mathilde was vague about him.&nbsp; In this interview, she told me about 
the order in which she and her brothers were born.&nbsp; She told me that Harold was 
born first, then came Mark, herself, Floyd, and Wakeman Wakeman Edwards.&nbsp; She 
went on to say that there were fourteen or fifteen years difference between 
Wakeman's birth and the birth of Henry.&nbsp; Therefore, most of Henry's siblings 
were already grown.</p>
<p>Ms. Edwards said that little Henry died at the 
age of 6 years.&nbsp; The family donated, as a memorial,&nbsp; a stained-glass window to 
the St. Anne's church [now St. Mary Magdalen church]. Mrs. C. J. Edwards had 
wanted to use a picture of&nbsp; St. Henry to represent her son in the window's 
scene.&nbsp; However, the priest, presumably Father Bollard, assured her that her 
son, having died at such a young age, was himself a saint.&nbsp; Therefore, the 
priest encouraged the family to use a photo of their son as a model for the 
child depicted in the window.&nbsp; The stained-glass company said that it could be 
done, but copied only his head.&nbsp; When the stained-glass window arrived in 
Abbeville, the family was not satisfied with the expression around the mouth of 
the child, according to Ms. Edwards, and notified the company, which she 
believed was located somewhere in Belgium.&nbsp; Since World War I was raging on in 
1916, I wonder if her memory was correct about this location.&nbsp; At any rate, the 
company sent another head, which the family accepted.&nbsp; Today, Henry's sweet, 
innocent face smiles down at us so life-like from the window as though from a 
photograph, while the angel's face seems illustrated and less realistic.&nbsp; Ms. 
Edwards said that she had the first stained-glass face of Henry wrapped up 
somewhere in her belongings, but I didn't follow up on this, and I never got to 
see it.&nbsp; Now, over 25 years later, I wonder if that stained-glass face still 
exists in the home of one of her relatives.&nbsp; It would be most interesting to see 
today, and to compare it to the one in the church's window.</p>

<p>Previously, I've expressed my own feelings or 
speculated on the feelings of those we have visited regarding the death of one 
of their loved ones.&nbsp; Here, I'll let Dr. C. J. Edwards' own words express his 
soul-tortured feelings about Henry's death:&nbsp; &quot;The light of our home has fled, a 
voice whose sound was sweet melody is forever stilled and all is dark and dreary 
where his joyous presence brightened like the Spring sunshine.&nbsp; Only those who 
have borne the heavy cross of human anguish and sorrow, can know the grief which 
plucks at our very heart strings.&quot;&nbsp; This literary scream of torment surely 
expressed Kate's feelings as well.&nbsp; Dr. Edwards' lament appeared in the <i>
Meridional</i> on July 29, 1916.</p>
<p>Again, years after this journey into the past 
appeared in the <i>Meridional</i>, I discovered that Dr. and Mrs. Edwards had 
previously tasted the bitter bile of losing a child, in fact, two of them. On 
June 10, 1905, their &quot;newly born infant son&quot; died and was buried that very day 
in the &quot;new&quot; Catholic Cemetery,&nbsp; which is located behind Mount Carmel 
Elementary.&nbsp; If I read the information correctly, the Edwards baby and 
57-year-old&nbsp; August Faisans were the first two individuals to be buried in this 
cemetery.&nbsp; In a related article that appeared in the <i>Meridional,</i> on June 
17, 1905,&nbsp; it was stated that &quot;the first interments in the new Catholic Cemetery 
occurred last Saturday and they were the extremes of life, an infant and an old 
man.&quot; </p>
<p>Two and a half years later,&nbsp; Dr. and Mrs. 
Edwards lost yet another infant.&nbsp; This one was Catherine Martha, who died on 
December 20, 1907, at the age of&nbsp; &quot;1 year, 4 months, and 5 days.&quot; Now we know 
who the Catherine, mentioned along with Henry on the stained-glass window is.&nbsp; I 
suppose that the Edwards' infant son, who died the day he was born, in 1905, was 
unnamed.</p>
<p>When Wakeman left to go St. Louis to seek his 
fortune, in 1918, Dr. C. J. Edwards had a few comments to make about this son's 
move away from home.&nbsp; He said that Wakeman was the baby of the family and the 
&quot;last of our boys to leave the parental roof tree.&nbsp; Youth's fond hopes can 
always see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the old home is lonely 
while the chase is on.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Henry had developed blood poisoning and 
was taken by Dr. Edwards to the Sanitarium in Crowley for &quot;surgical treatment&quot; 
on Sunday July 23, 1916.&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry died three days later on Wednesday July 26, 
1916, a few weeks before his 7th birthday.&nbsp; How helpless we feel because of the 
suffering and death of a loved one.&nbsp; How much more so must it be for a 
physician, the healer among us!</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards, a Democrat, showed an early 
interest in and a propensity for politics. &nbsp;In addition to noting his 18th 
birthday in his diary on October 3, 1876, Clarence also observed that the day 
had been “selected for the Grand Democratic Mass Meeting and Barbecue at 
Abbeville.”</p>
<p>On April 10, 1894, Dr. Edwards was elected to 
succeed Don Caffery as State Senator, and was assigned to the important 
judiciary committee.&nbsp; Contrary to his obituary, Edwards did not serve a full 
four-year term.&nbsp; He was defeated in 1896 by F. B. Williams.&nbsp; While he may not 
have been too popular with other Vermilion Parish residents, Abbevillians 
certainly considered him a leader.&nbsp; He was elected yearly, from 1890 through 
1895, as town councilman.&nbsp; It's interesting to note that he continued to serve 
as alderman during his first year as State Senator.&nbsp; From 1903 through 1907, Dr. 
Edwards served as a councilman again.</p>
<p>At the time of his death in 1920, Dr. Edwards 
was Chairman of the parish Democratic Executive Committee, and was still serving 
as President of the School Board.&nbsp; He was elected to this office in 1912.</p>
<p>In addition to political offices, Edwards was 
involved in business ventures, as well as in social organizations.&nbsp; He was the 
first president of the board of directors of the Abbeville Building &amp; Loan 
Association in 1890.&nbsp; In 1898, he still held this office.&nbsp; In 1915 he was 
elected once again as president of ABLA.&nbsp; Dr. Edwards was the first president of 
the board of directors of the East Side Canal Co. in 1901.&nbsp; This company was to 
have built canals, and rice mills, etc.</p>
<p>There were high expectations that oil would be 
found on Dr. Edwards' property.&nbsp; On the downward slope of a ridge on his 
property near the Vermilion River, there were several springs.&nbsp; &quot;The soil near 
the springs is of a spongy nature, and continually emits gas bubbles and if a 
stick is thrust into the ground and a lighted match is applied, a miniature 
explosion occurs and a beautiful blue blaze will burn for minutes.&quot; This quote 
form the New Orleans <i>Times Democrat</i> was printed in the <i>Meridional </i>
in 1901.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It was assumed that this evidence of gas was a 
sure bet that oil would be discovered there.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the Vermilion 
Mineral and Oil Co., Ltd. was organized and Dr. Edwards was its first 
treasurer.&nbsp; More than 80 individuals, including Eli Wise, W. P. Edwards, W. W. 
Edwards, A. Kaplan, L. O. Broussard, J. T. Labit, D. L. McPherson, Martin 
Bagley, and L. Sokoloski, invested in this company.&nbsp; Alas, they do not seem to 
have realized their dreams.&nbsp; Perhaps someone can tell us for sure.&nbsp; The gas 
deposit on his land, if that is what it was, must have caused visions of black 
gold and of striking it rich—Cha-ching!</p>
<p>In 1877, while still a teenager, C. J. became a 
member of the Abbeville Literary Society, which had been organized in 1875.&nbsp; In 
his first debate sponsored by this club, C. J. had been on the affirmative 
team.&nbsp; The issue was, &quot;Should the right of Suffrage be conferred upon women?&quot;&nbsp; 
According to his diary: &quot;My effort surprised some of the natives and brought the 
house down several times.&quot;&nbsp; His leadership abilities were such that in that same 
year, he was elected president of this society over Lymon C. Lyons, who had been 
our sheriff the previous year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr. Edwards was also a member of the Knights of 
Pythias, the Woodmen of the World, and of the Masonic Lodge.&nbsp; In fact, one of 
his obits indicated that he had been &quot;one of the oldest members&quot; of the latter 
organization at the time of his death.&nbsp; In 1907, he even served for a short time 
as manager of the power plant.&nbsp; The town council had elected him to this 
position temporarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>As I've said earlier, one of Dr. Edwards' 
passions was journalism.&nbsp; We cannot finish this visit without reporting on his 
connections to the <i>Meridional</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps his first admission of this 
newspaper's existence, in his diary, was shortly before the <i>Vermilion Banner
</i>was first published.&nbsp; He referred to our perpetual paper, on July 21, 1876, 
as &quot;a half sheet hand-bill,&quot; which, although not perfectly understood by me, 
doesn't sound too flattering.&nbsp; How ironic that the disdain he showed for the <i>
Meridional </i>would change so drastically that he would eventually become 
owner, editor and publisher of our newspaper.&nbsp; </p>
<p>His first direct contact with this paper was on 
August 10, 1878, when &quot;a few articles from my pen&quot; appeared in it.&nbsp; In 1891, he 
bought half interest in the <i>Meridional </i>from E. I. Addison and became its 
business manager.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1901, the beginning moment of the 
Twentieth Century, and shortly after E. I. Addison's death, Dr. C. J. Edwards 
took complete management and ownership of the newspaper.&nbsp; Nineteen years later, 
almost to the day, when Dr. Edwards died on January 14, 1920, he was still 
editor and manager of the <i>Meridional</i>.&nbsp; It seems to me that his 
editorials, especially in his final years, were strong, unrestrained and 
articulate statements about things that he felt were wrong.&nbsp; Also, to me, his 
editorials showed his marvelous eye for details and his skills as a writer.&nbsp; His 
power and influence on this newspaper can be measured, in part, by the fact that 
the general public had to be reassured that his death &quot;will in no way cause an 
interruption in the business of the <i>Abbeville Meridional</i>,&quot; as was stated 
in this newspaper on January 24, 1920.&nbsp; Also in this issue, the manager was 
listed as F. D. Edwards, son of Dr. Edwards.&nbsp; Beginning on February 14, 1920, 
Mrs. C. J. Edwards began being listed as &quot;proprietress&quot; of the <i>Meridional</i>, 
while F. D. Edwards continued to be listed as manager.</p>
<p>Even though he wore more proverbial hats than 
most individuals, Dr. Edwards still had time to enjoy gardening.&nbsp; As early as 
1893, his garden was mentioned in the newspaper, because he had two camphor 
trees, apparently rare plants for this area at that time.&nbsp; In 1912, he had 
several &quot;experimental plots&quot; on which he was growing plants that the Department 
of Agriculture considered &quot;useful.&quot;&nbsp; This governmental agency was attempting to 
introduce these plants &quot;into suitable localities in this country.&quot;&nbsp; The &quot;useful 
foreign plants&quot; included giant bamboo, a Chinese wood oil tree and kudzu.&nbsp; I'll 
bet that the residents of Milton, La. consider kudzu as anything but useful.</p>

<p class="centered">
AND THEN HE WAS DEAD!!!</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards died suddenly at his residence from 
&quot;acute heart failure,&quot; at the age of 61.&nbsp; Several obituaries appeared within 
days of his death, including a brief one in the New Orleans <i>Times Picayune</i>.&nbsp; 
In one obituary, Dr. Edwards was said to have been the &quot;genial savant,&quot; 
socially.&nbsp; He made &quot;no parade of his learning yet (was) unable to conceal the 
brightness of his intellect or the kindness of his heart.&quot;&nbsp; It added that he had 
a &quot;few foibles,&quot; which served to endear him &quot;the more to those close enough to 
him to observe them.&quot;</p>
<p>These thoughts made me realize that all the 
other individuals that we have visited in our journeys into the past had their 
faults and shortcomings too, even though they are generally unknown to us 
today.&nbsp; These individuals were only human.&nbsp; Their &quot;heroic deeds&quot; were achieved 
in spite of their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Quoting once more from Dr. Edwards' obituaries, 
here is one final tribute that was paid to him: &quot;Had he lived in that olden time 
when men's attributes became a surname, he would have been known here as 
'Clarence the Good-hearted...&quot;</p>
<p>His wife, Mrs. Kate Young Edwards, died on 
August 4, 1926, &quot;at the age of fifty-nine years, two months and three days.&quot;&nbsp; 
Her obituary gives us knowledge of her surviving children and where they were 
living at the time of her death.&nbsp; Dr. H. G. Edwards was living in Lafayette; 
Mark H. Edwards was living in Reedley, California. Her other children: Miss 
Francis Mathilde Edwards, Floyd D. Edwards and Wakeman W. Edwards continued to 
live in Abbeville. </p>
<p>Well, our visit with Dr. Clarence Jeptha Edwards 
is over.&nbsp; He shone among us for a short while—like a child's bright sparkler—and 
then he was gone.&nbsp; From salt miner to State Senator, from parent to physician, 
and from Mason to journalist, Dr. Edwards influenced the direction of his 
family, our town, and even of our state.</p>
<p>May we remember him, each in our own way.</p>
