<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="commentary"></a>I (Marty Grant) am a 4<sup>th</sup> 
Great Grand nephew of John Edwards.</font></p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
<p>John Edwards was born ca 1790/94 per census analysis. He was only listed on 
one census (1820) where he was enumerated as age 26-44 or born ca 1775/94. 
Looking at his parents census entry in 1810, I think he was home age 16-25 
(1784/94) that year. Backing up to 1800, his parents had three apparent sons of 
compatible age, two born ca 1784/90, and one born ca 1790/1800. It is not 
possible to determine which was John for sure, so it might be more accurate to 
list his birth date at ca 1784/94.</p>
<p>John Edwards was born in <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/refs/nc/wayne-nc.htm">Wayne 
County, North Carolina</a> somewhere in the vicinity of Yellow Marsh Branch, 
west of present day Goldsboro.</p>
<p>John Edwards is a proven child of <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-david-wayne.htm">David and 
Lydia (---) Edwards</a>, and was named in his father's Will of 1838. </p>
<p>John did <u>not</u> seem to be home with his parents for the 1790 census, for 
they only had one apparent son that year, a male under 16 (born 1774/90), and I 
think that was probably Stephen Edwards instead of John.</p>
<p>John was probably home with his parents for the 1800 census, aged 10-15 (born 
ca 1784/90) or age &quot;under 10&quot; (born ca 1790/1800).</p>
<p>John was probably home with his parents for the 1810 census, aged 16-25 (born 
ca 1784/94).</p>
<p align="left">On 1 Aug 1810 John Edwards (and his brother
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-stephen-wayne.htm">Stephen Edwards</a>, and cousin
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-sampson-wayne.htm#john">John Edwards</a>) witnessed the Will of 
their grandfather <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-john-wayne.htm">John Edwards</a>. </p>
<p align="left">The 1810 Will of John's grandfather shows an important thing, 
namely that there were <i>three </i>adult men named John Edwards in Wayne County 
at that time. That means there could be some confusion about which record 
pertains to which John Edwards. John Sr died in 1810, so that leaves him out of 
any records after that date.</p>
<p>On 4 Mar 1811, <u>J. Edwards</u> and E. Slocumb witnessed a deed from John 
Wilson to Stephen Edwards (John's brother). &quot;J. Edwards&quot; could be John Edwards, 
or it could be their uncle James Edwards. <font size="2">(Duplin Co, NC Deed 
Book U page 420).</font></p>
<p>John Edwards married someone in Wayne County (presumably) prior to 1817. I <i>
think </i>that his wife was <b>Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Minshew</b> based on a few bits of 
compelling circumstantial evidence. First of all, Nathan Minshew made his Will 
in Wayne County on 16 Apr 1818 and named (among others) his daughter &quot;Sally 
Edwards&quot;. This shows that his daughter was married to a Mr. Edwards prior to 
1818. The next bit is that John Edwards' son Gabriel married Pearcy Peal (or 
Peel) who was also a grandchild of Nathan Minshew. Since a large percentage of 
marriages in those days were among first cousins, it seems reasonable to assume 
this was also the case, for if Gabriel's otherwise unknown mother was Sarah 
Minshew, then that would make his wife his 1st cousin, as she was a daughter of 
Patty Minshew, Sarah Minshew Edwards' sister. This isn't conclusive proof in and 
of itself, but it adds to the pile of evidence. Next is the fact that John 
Edwards died not too long after marriage (died in the 1820's), and the 1830 
census shows a Sarah Edwards listed as a widow, and she did have an apparent son 
that matches Gabriel Edwards in age, and he has not been located anywhere else 
that year.</p>
<p>So, if my theory is correct (and I'm reasonably sure it is), John Edwards 
married <b>Sarah Minshew</b> between 1810 and ca 1817. She was born ca 1794/1800 
in Wayne County, daughter of Nathan Minshew and Elizabeth Bryan. </p>
<p>John Edwards was listed on the 1820 census in Wayne County. Unfortunately, 
this census was alphabetical, so I can't tell who his neighbors were or where he 
was living exactly. </p>

<p>On 24 Apr 1820, Asher Flowers deeded property to <u>John Edwards Sr</u>. I 
don't have the details of this deed yet, nor who the witnesses were.
<font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 12 page 481)</font>.</p>
<p>It is interesting that John was listed as &quot;Sr&quot; in this deed (he was also 
listed as &quot;Sr&quot; in his father's 1838 Will). This can only mean that a younger 
John Edwards was around then but who was of age (21 or older), or close enough 
to cause confusion (16-20 years old). That was the only reason &quot;Sr&quot; and &quot;Jr&quot; was 
used in those days. It did not signify any sort of relationship.&nbsp; This 
&quot;other&quot; John Edwards may be his cousin John Edwards (1790/1800) son of
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-sampson-wayne.htm">Sampson Edwards</a>, or it could be
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-john-1795-wayne.htm">John Edwards (c1795)</a> who married 
Burnety Tyner. The next one is <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-john-1800-wayne.htm">John 
Edwards (c1800)</a> who married Easter Capps.&nbsp; These two other Johns 
appeared in Wayne County records in the 1820's. </p>
<p>On 20 Oct 1821, John Edwards deeded property to Bryan Sollis. Witnesses were 
Stephen Jones and B. Carraway.&nbsp; I'm not totally sure which John Edwards 
this was, but the Carraway connection makes it seem likely it was this same 
John, for they were neighbors to the Carraways, and related by marriage. </p>
<p>On 12 Apr 1822, some of the land of John Edwards &quot;of Wayne&quot; Co, NC was sold 
by the Sheriff to John Killet (son-in-law of Sampson Edwards). This land was 
sold by virtue of a &quot;Writ of Fieri Faacas&quot; (Court order) against John Edwards, 
convicted of debt. I'm not sure which John Edwards this refers to.
<font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 12 page 300)</font>.</p>
<p>John Edwards died sometime in the 1820's. I didn't find a Will nor an Estate 
record for him, so I don't know exactly when he died.</p>
<p>There were two John Edwards listed on the 1830 census, but they were the 
other two I mentioned earlier, and not this John. Sarah Edwards, whom I believe 
to be widow of this John was listed as head of household on the 1830 census in 
Wayne County. Unfortunately, this census was alphabetical, so I can't tell who 
her neighbors were, nor where she was living exactly. Although the census was 
alphabetical, it was alphabetical within various groups, and Sarah was listed in 
the same little group with David Edwards, who was John's father, so this lends 
weight to the theory that she was John's wife. </p>

<p>John's father David Edwards made his Will on 13 Dec 1838 in Wayne Co, NC and 
stated: &quot;Item give and bequeath to Gabriel Edwards son of John Edwards Senr, 
decd two thirds of my whole Estate&quot;. He does not name any other children of 
John, so it could be that he had no siblings living at that point. He named all 
three of his deceased son Stephen's children, so it seems likely he would have 
done the same for John. </p>
<p>I did not find Sarah Minshew Edwards listed on the 1840 census. Her son 
Gabriel Edwards was listed as head of household that year, but Sarah did not 
seem to be living with him. She may have died before then, or remarried.</p>

<p>In the 1850's Gabriel made many land transactions, and it would seem he was 
just land speculating for profit, and not to live on any of this land. As best 
as I can tell, he lived somewhere in the vicinity just west of Seven Springs 
near Hines Crossroads. To avoid all the typing, I'll just a brief index of the 
many deeds he was involved with in this period:</p>

<p>Gabriel was not listed on the 1862 or 1863 tax lists for Wayne County.</p>
<p>On 3 Jan 1863 Gabriel Edwards made a deed to Lyman Lilly. <font size="2">
(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 27 page 316).</font></p>
<p>On 16 Aug 1866, James Kelly and Gabriel Edwards deeded property to Thomas T. 
Hollowel. <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 27 page 598).</font></p>
<p>Gabriel and children were listed on the 1870 census in Wayne County in 
Brogden Township. Pearcy was not home, so it would seem that she had died in the 
1860-1870 timeframe. There were a couple of very young children at home, but 
they are children of Martha Edwards.</p>

<p>Gabriel Edwards apparently died in the 1870's, for he was not listed on the 
1880 census, but several of his unmarried children were all residing together in
