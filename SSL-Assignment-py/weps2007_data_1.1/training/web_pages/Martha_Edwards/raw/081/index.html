      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Witnesses 
        Come Clean </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brandi's 
        mother Martha Edwards, her brothers Gary Garrett and Eddy Edwards and 
        maternal grandmother Tillie Phelps all testified that Brandi's story was, 
        in Martha's words, "all a big lie." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Gary told 
        the court that he went along with the story for the sake of his sister 
        Brandi, who wanted to get away from her stepfather. Eddy concurred. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As their 
        mother put it: "...they didn't know that...they would be hurting two men 
        and maybe having them go to prison for the rest of their lives, and he 
        (Gary) thought he'd better tell the truth." </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Verdict 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Despite 
        the inconsistencies and contradictions in Brandi's story and despite the 
        fact that the witnesses to Brandi's sexual assault testified under oath 
        that the story was a lie, the jury found David Don Abernathie guilty of 
        two counts of sexual assault. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Aftermath 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sharon Abernathie 
        was 28 weeks pregnant when her husband's trial began. During the course 
        of the trial, Sharon went into premature labor. The doctors performed 
        a C-section; Sharon almost died. The Abernathie's infant son, however, 
        did not fare as well. After living 15 hours, he died from lung problems 
        at Sunrise Neo-Natal Unit. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But I got 
        to hold him before he died," says Rebecca Temple, Sharon's mother. "The 
        doctors blamed the loss of the baby on the stress of the trial." </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Sentencing 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On Tuesday, 
        June 26, 1990, David Don Abernathie appeared before the Honorable Carl 
        J. Christensen for sentencing. Abernathie appeared with his attorney, 
        Robert Beckett. After Deputy District Attorney Moreo reviewed the evidence 
        from the trial, Judge Christensen asked Abernathie if he wanted to speak. 
        </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, sir, 
        I do," stated Abernathie. "Very briefly, I don't know nothing about the 
        appeal process. However, I would like to for the record state that I do 
        want to appeal this...four of the witnesses, all being family members--the 
        mother, both brothers...the grandmother--testified in my behalf that this 
        sexual assault never did occur. I can't see any reason why they would 
        testify in my behalf...It didn't happen...I am innocent and that's all 
        I can say." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Don David 
        Abernathie was sentenced to spend the rest of his natural days--two consecutive 
        sentences of life imprisonment--in the Nevada Department of Prisons with 
        the possibility of parole. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1990 to 
        1998 </font></h3>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Prison 
        Years </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For eight 
        years, Abernathie spent every moment living out his waking nightmare. 
        When asked about that time, Abernathie is composed. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I never 
        got any flack when I was in prison because I kept good public relations," 
        says Abernathie. "I worked out all the time. No one messed with me." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie 
        spent his prison years fighting for the truth of his innocence to be revealed, 
        by appealing his case three times. Each appeal was denied. But he didn't 
        give up hope, despite his belief that the plea bargain his co-defendant 
        Edwards accepted had jeopardized his appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court. 
        </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1996 </font></h3>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Recantation 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On April 
        11, 1996, Brandi Garrett recanted. She admitted that she lied about David 
        Abernathie. And she felt guilty. (As it turned out, Frank Edwards was 
        guilty of molesting his stepdaughter, but not in 1988. According to medical 
        reports, Brandi Garrett was raped in 1986, two years before the alleged 
        attack that involved Abernathie. Her symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
        disorder were, in fact, real; however, the story she told about the December 
        1988 rape was false.) </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brandi had 
        her statement notarized and was examined by a psychologist who evaluated 
        her motivation for recantation; yet Abernathie still wasn't home free. 
        What he needed was a pinch hitter; enter Mace Yampolsky, ready to play 
        hard ball. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What I 
        don't understand is why it took two years after the alleged victim recanted 
        for David to win his freedom," says local criminal defense attorney Yampolsky. 
        "Why didn't the State dismiss the case?" </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1997 </font></h3>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Lie 
        Detector Test </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yampolsky, 
        who took the case pro bono, began by having Abernathie take a lie detector 
        test. On October 17, 1997, Abernathie took a polygraph test at the request 
        of his attorney. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The data 
        was analyzed by three different computerized algorithms; each algorithm 
        evaluated the data to be truthful. The data was also evaluated by traditional 
        methods of polygraphy. The results were the same: David Abernathie was 
        telling the truth. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Eight years 
        earlier, the District Attorney's office threatened Abernathie with a lie 
        detector test. Although he wanted to take the test, Abernathie says the 
        detective never returned his phone calls. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Armed with 
        the results of the lie dector test and the recantation, Yampolsky continued 
        to work on Abernathie's behalf--and in doing so won Abernathie's everlasting 
        gratitude. Having been shuffled around by the criminal justice system, 
        Abernathie was skeptical about attorneys. He didn't trust Yampolsky in 
        the beginning, but he quickly learned that Yampolsky was on top of the 
        case. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's a 
        great man," Abernathie says. "He's a fighter." </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1998 Catch 
        22-- </font></h3>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Almost 
        Free at Last </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thanks to 
        Yampolsky's efforts on his behalf, the D.A. offered Abernathie a choice: 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1) a new 
        trial; or </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2) to agree 
        that the D.A.'s office could prove a case against him, should it decide 
        to do so. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was a 
        tough choice. Disillusioned with the criminal justice system here in Nevada, 
        Abernathie chose not to suffer through another trial and another jury. 
        He chose option number two. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In May 1998--nearly 
        9 1/2 years after the alleged crime was committed--David Don Abernathie 
        stepped off the prison yard and out from behind the gray razor wire that 
        kept him captive for eight years. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Despite 
        his release, he remains a marked man. Although he is out of prison and 
        happily reunited with his family, Abernathie is still fighting to remove 
        the stigma of convicted sex offender from his record. </font>

        They Now </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Frank Edwards
