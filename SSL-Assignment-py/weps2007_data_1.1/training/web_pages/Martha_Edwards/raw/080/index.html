      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If you're 
        black or poor and you get arrested, you'll do time," says David Abernathie 
        of North Las Vegas. </font></p>
	  
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie's 
        skepticism about the system is justified. Accused, arrested, then convicted 
        and sentenced for a crime he didn't commit, Abernathie spent eight years 
        in prison, moving from Indian Springs to Ely State Prison to Indian Springs 
        to Jean to Indian Springs to Lovelock and back to Jean. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Released 
        from the Southern Nevada Correctional Center in May, Abernathie is ready 
        to tell his story--the story of the criminal justice system in Nevada, 
        and how its flaws robbed him of eight years of his life. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1988 </font><br>
        <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Nightmare Begins </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie's 
        nightmare began in 1988 when he began working for Frank Edwards as a drywall 
        hanger. Having been convicted twice for theft-related charges, Abernathie 
        had trouble finding work. So, in 1988, when Edwards' and Abernathie's 
        wives met one another while working at a convenience store and suggested 
        their husbands work together, Abernathie's life appeared to take a turn 
        for the better. Abernathie took the job with Edwards, making $18 an hour 
        and driving the company truck. It seemed like a dream come true. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But the 
        dream was short-lived. The Edwards family had problems of its own--problems 
        that would not only eventually tear their family apart but take Abernathie 
        down with them. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie 
        soon learned that Edwards drank too much. One night Abernathie dropped 
        a drunk Edwards off at home. A fight between Edwards and his wife ensued; 
        Abernathie intervened. He took Edwards' two stepchildren--14-year-old 
        Brandi and 12-year-old Gary Garrett--to his trailer. (Five-year-old son 
        Eddy Edwards remained at the house.) Not long afterwards, Brandi grabbed 
        her things, cut a screen in the bedroom window and left Abernathie's trailer. 
        Two days later, Martha Edwards came for the boys. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This was 
        the first of many such incidents. Frequently drunk, Edwards harassed Brandi, 
        Gary and Eddie, and fought with his wife. Due to Edwards's DUI conviction, 
        Abernathie always drove Edwards back and forth to work. Since he spent 
        a lot of time with Edwards, Abernathie was inadvertently drawn into the 
        Edwards' family soap opera. Eventually tiring of being the "rescuer," 
        he quit his lucrative job and severed ties with Edwards.</font>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Unemployed 
        since leaving Edwards, Abernathie stayed home and took care of his infant 
        son David while his wife, Sharon, worked to support the family. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The birth 
        of his first child in 1989 transformed Abernathie, who was often seen 
        pushing a stroller through the neighborhood. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Dave changed 
        after the baby was born," says Rebecca Temple, Abernathie's mother-in-law. 
        "The change was astounding." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But Abernathie's 
        stint as stay-at-home dad was cut short in February 1990, when he was 
        arrested, thrown in jail and charged with: 1) sexual assault with a minor 
        under fourteen years of age; 2) lewdness with a minor; and 3) sexual assault 
        with the use of a deadly weapon. His former employer, Frank Edwards, was 
        charged as well. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I thought 
        the charges would be dropped," says Abernathie, who was still on parole 
        at the time for a previous attempted grand larceny conviction. Since he 
        was innocent and there was no parole hold on him at the time of his arrest, 
        he didn't think he'd be sent back to prison. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On February 
        28, 1990, Abernathie and Edwards appeared before Justice of the Peace 
        Daniel Ahlstrom at a preliminary hearing. Both defendants were represented 
        by court-appointed counsel. Horrified, Abernathie listened as the alleged 
        victim, Brandi Garrett, told a garish tale about what she claimed happened 
        on December 28, 1988. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brandi's 
        Story </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This is 
        the story Brandi told police: After Abernathie and Edwards smoked what 
        she believed was rock cocaine, Abernathie grabbed her and held her down 
        while Edwards removed her panties and had sexual intercourse with her. 
        According to Brandi, Abernathie forced her to perform oral copulation 
        on him as Edwards looked on. When Brandi was finished with Abernathie, 
        Edwards forced her to perform oral copulation on him as well. During the 
        attack, Abernathie supposedly brandished a knife and threatened Brandi. 
        The attack was allegedly witnessed by Brandi's brothers.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Arraignment 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On March 
        15, 1990, Abernathie and co-defendant Edwards were arraigned on sexual 
        assault and lewdness charges. Both men were ordered held in custody until 
        the date of trial, May 7, 1990. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Edwards 
        retained a private attorney, James E. Smith, who filed a motion for the 
        victim, Brandi Garrett, to undergo independent psychiatric evaluation. 
        In the meantime, the District Attorney's office offered Abernathie a couple 
        of deals: </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1)</b> 
        If he testified against the co-defendant, he could get off for a 2-10 
        year sentence; or </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>2)</b> 
        He could opt for a 1-10 year sentence without testifying if he pled guilty 
        to all charges (with the sexual assault with a deadly weapon charge dropped). 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If he accepted 
        neither deal, the D.A. threatened him with habitual criminal enhancement. 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie 
        did not bow to the D.A.'s threats, however. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Since the 
        crime never happened, there was nothing to testify to," says Abernathie. 
        "I know the Judge and the District Attorney both knew I was innocent." 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie's 
        confidence proved premature; by May 3, 1990, Edwards had withdrawn his 
        "not guilty" plea and pled guilty to lewdness with a minor. All other 
        charges against Edwards were dropped. The Court accepted the plea; the 
        court date was vacated and reset for May 14, 1990. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And Brandi 
        Garrett was not interviewed by an independent psychologist. </font>

              conclusions about the efficacy of the criminal justice system, there

            <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * 
              In 1970, the prison population in the United States hovered around 
              200,000. In the intervening years, there has been a eight-fold increase

            <p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Prisons 
              are being filled as fast as we can build them," Michael Murphy, 
              a prison psychologist in Massachusetts. "They are the secret fortresses 
              where, year after year, we dump everything we call 'evil' and slam 
              the door." </font> 
            <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> According 
              to a local attorney who asked to not be named, many people are subjected 
              to incompetent counsel. "Folks are being terribly represented. Many 
              attorneys simply don't care. They don't like their clients; they 
              want the cases to be over. Scared and witless, many people will 
              accept a plea bargain and waive their rights. </font>

      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Trial 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At 10 o'clock 
        sharp on the morning of May, 14, 1990, David Abernathie and his attorney 
        Robert Beckett listened as Deputy District Attorney Thomas Moreo made 
        his opening statement in Department VII of District Court before the Honorable 
        Carl J. Christensen, District Judge. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreo 
        argued that the evidence would show that in the early part of January 
        1989, Brandi and Gary Garrett confronted their mother, Martha Edwards, 
        and told her what they claimed had happened in December. As a consequence 
        of hearing her children's horrific story, she fled to Southern California 
        with her children in tow. There she contacted police who subsequently 
        investigated the alleged incident at the request of Metro. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Moreo told 
        the jury that there would be no physical evidence of the sort usually 
        presented in such trials. The only evidence that the State would present 
        would be from the witness stand. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The State's 
        first witness was Brandi Garrett. After describing in detail the alleged 
        sexual assault, Brandi testified that Abernathie threatened to kill her. 
        </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Did you 
        actually believe that Mr. Abernathie would kill you?" asked Moreo. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes. I 
        just figured someone sick enough to do that is someone who would be sick 
        enough to kill someone." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During cross-examination, 
        Beckett asked Brandi if she knew the difference between telling the truth 
        and telling a lie; she replied that she knew the difference and that she 
        was telling the truth. Beckett continued querying Brandi about the difference 
        between lying and telling the truth until Moreo objected. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Beckett's 
        line of questioning revealed several inconsistencies in Brandi's story--such 
        as the fact that at the preliminary hearing, she'd testified that Edwards 
        ejaculated in her mouth. However, during the trial she testified that 
        he did not ejaculate. Likewise, during the trial she tesitifed that Abernathie 
        did not ejaculate during the assault, but in her statement to Monrovia 
        (California) police, she claimed he had ejaculated. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Within hours 
        of the start of the trial, it was clear that her testimony was riddled 
        with inconsistencies. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Judge 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During the 
        proceedings the judge interrupted Beckett during the cross-examination 
        of Brandi, to Abernathie's detriment. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...I'm 
        going to caution the defendant. I don't want you to look at the witness 
        in a menacing way and shaking your head 'yes' or 'no' anymore." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abernathie 
        apologized. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This cautioning 
        helped brand Abernathie as guilty in the eyes of the jury--and he'd pay 
        for that dearly when the time came for a verdict. </font>
      <h3><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Psychologist 
        </font></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ph.D. psychologist 
        Donna S. Mognett had counseled Brandi in California in her adolescent 
        group. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the 
        beginning she could hardly participate in group," testified Mognett. "She 
        sat and cried and trembled. Toward the end of group she could talk a little 
        bit about what happened to her and what was happening to her at the time. 
        She was having what we commonly refer to as flashbacks." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> According 
        to Mognett, Brandi had the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome, 
        a common diagnosis for rape victims. After seeing her, she made a report 
        to social worker Barbara Jenkins, in which she revealed that she believed 
        that Brandi had been raped. Moreover, she believed that Brandi was still 
        in danger, as her "therapy was sporadic" and her "mom was talking about 
        getting back together with Frank." Brandi had suffered two breakdowns 
        and had been in the hospital twice, once in April and once and August; 
        Mognett believed that were Brandi exposed to Frank again, "she could not 
        take much more." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Jenkins, 
        a California social worker with 22 years' experience working with abused 
        children, confirmed Mognett's appraisal, adding that Brandi had described 
        to her several incidents in which her stepfather Frank Edwards had made 
        passes at her, kissed her on the neck, fondled her and forced her to have 
        intercourse with him.</font>
