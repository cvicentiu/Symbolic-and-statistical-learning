<hr>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="commentary"></a>I (Marty Grant) am a 3rd 
Great grandson of William and Rachel Edwards.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">William Edwards was born ca 1825/26 in Wayne Co, 
NC, somewhere in or near the present Town of Mount Olive. His suspected parents 
lived on or very close to the Duplin County line (which at that time was not so 
clearly defined). I base his approximate birth year on his ages given in the 
various census records. His age was fairly consistent from census to census: 
1850 age 24 (c1825/26); 1860 age 32 (c1827/28); 1870 age 44 (c1825/26), 1880 age 
53 (c1826/27).</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I strongly believe that William is a son of
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-barnabas-madison-tn.htm">Barnabas and Catherine Edwards</a>, 
but have no direct proof of that fact. Circumstantial evidence points to them as 
his parents, but it could be incorrect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">First of all, William named his oldest son 
&quot;Barnabas&quot;. This would make sense if he was named in honor of William's father.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Secondly, Barnabas Edwards did have an apparent 
son William's age, who is otherwise unaccounted for. In the 1830 census, 
Barnabas had a male with him aged &quot;under 5&quot;, or born ca 1825/30. This fits 
perfectly with William's birth of ca 1826.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thirdly, Barnabas Edwards was the only Edwards (at 
the time of William's birth) who lived near Mount Olive. Other Edwards were not 
too far from there, but he was the only one who was there. Since William was 
there in the 1840's through mid 1850's it seems reasonable that he was born and 
raised there also.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Those three facts above are circumstantial 
evidence, but they do support William being Barnabas' child. Those are the 
&quot;pros&quot;, now here are the &quot;cons&quot;:</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Barnabas and family left North Carolina around 
1836 for Madison Co, TN. William would only have been about 10 years old then, 
so it would make no sense for him to remain behind in NC, unless living with his 
grandparents (quite possible). It is also possible that William did go to 
Tennessee with his parents, but returned to Wayne County, NC when he was old 
enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In any event, William Edwards was in NC in the 
late 1840's when he married.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the 1830 census, William Edwards would have 
been approximately 4 years old, so if listed on the census, he would be in the 
&quot;under 5&quot; age group (born ca 1825/30). In the 1830 Wayne Co, NC census, there 
were several Edwards households, but only one with a child this age, and that 
was <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-joseph-wayne.htm">Joseph Edwards</a>, but he is not 
William's father (Joseph's heirs were all named in Estate records). However,
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-barnabas-madison-tn.htm">Barnabas Edwards</a> was listed in 
1830, but in Duplin County living in present day Mount Olive and he did have a 
son &quot;under 5&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the 1840 census, William would have been about 
14 years old, so if listed, should be in the age 10-14 age group (born ca 
1825/30).&nbsp; His suspected parents were in Madison Co, TN for the 1840 census 
and did <u>not</u> have a son in that age group (their apparent son 1825/30 with 
them in 1830 was apparently not with them in 1840). Back in Wayne County, there 
were several Edwards households listed, but as before, only Joseph Edwards had a 
son that age, and that was not William. My guess is that William was living with 
some other family members in Wayne County, or he was with his parents in 
Tennessee, but mis-enumerated. (They did have 3 apparent sons age 5-9, born ca 
1830/35, two of whom are unidentified, so one <i>could</i> be William).</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">William Edwards married <b>Rachel Roberts</b> in 
Wayne Co, NC before ca 1848. There is no marriage record for them, but their 
oldest child was born ca 1848. Her maiden name is given on the death certificate 
of her son Gabriel Edwards (died 1938). Rachel Roberts was born ca 1830/31 in 
Wayne Co, NC, daughter of <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/roberts/roberts-richard-wayne.htm">
Richard Roberts and Rebecca Hobson</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 8 Aug 1848, William Edwards and William J. Hall 
witnessed a deed from Willis Hall to
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/roberts/roberts-richard-wayne.htm#henry">Henry Roberts Jr</a> 
(William's brother-in-law) for land on both sides of the Railroad tracks (in 
Mount Olive). <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 21 page 140)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">William and Rachel and family were listed on the 
1850 census in Wayne Co, NC in the division &quot;south of the Neuse River&quot;. Clearly 
they were in what is now Mount Olive. William's occupation was listed a Laborer 
on the WRRR (I think this stands for the Wilmington - Roanoke Rail Road). This 
census taker also thoughtfully listed the birth county of each family, leaving 
it blank for Wayne County, but entering something if a different county. William 
and family were all born in Wayne County.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 19 Oct 1853, William Edwards sold 70 acres to 
his cousin-in-law <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/roberts/roberts-john-duplin.htm#gideon">Gideon 
M. Roberts</a>. The land was described as on the W &amp; R Railroad. I have not

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 28 Oct 1853, James Williams sold William

Witnesses were Gideon M. Roberts and Stephen Williamson. <font size="2">(Wayne

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 30 May 1854 William Edwards sold James McDuffie 
one lot in Town of Mount Olive &quot;where Store House stands&quot;, east side of 
Railroad, Lot # 2. I have not found where William acquired this land. Witnessed 
by Joel Loftin. <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 25 page 262)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 17 Apr 1855 William Edwards sold one half of 
Lot # 10 in Mount Olive to James McDuffie. Witnessed by G. M. Roberts and Joseph 
D. Berry. <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 25 page 263)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 2 May 1856, Ollen Coor, Sheriff of Wayne 
County, sold land to Jacquiline Jones (of Duplin Co, NC), that had belonged to 
William Edwards and James McDuffie but had been taken in a Court action. I have 
not yet checked the Court records for this time period to see what the case was 
about, though it was probably a matter of debt. <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC 
Deed Book 25 page 447)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the same date (2 May 1856), Ollen Coor sold 
another tract to Jacquiline Jones, the land formerly belonging to William 
Edwards and James McDuffie. <font size="2">(Wayne Co, NC Deed Book 25 page 449)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This was the last record found for William Edwards 
in Wayne Co, NC. It would seem that it was around this time that he moved his 
family down to Horry District, South Carolina and got into the Turpentine 
business. I don't know what prompted him to move down there unless it was due to 
the Court actions in 1856. Rachel's brother Henry Roberts went to Horry also, 
but I don't know if they went together, or separately. I don't know if they had 
any relatives in Horry already. There were quite a few Roberts families in Horry 
already, but I know of no provable connection to Rachel's family. There was only 
one Edwards family in Horry at that time, but he does not seem to be related 
either. (<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/edwards/edwards-john-horry.htm">John Edwards</a>). There was a fairly 
large Edwards family in neighboring Marion District, but I don't think there is 
a connection between them and the William Edwards family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">William Edwards and family settled in Gallivants 
Ferry Township (bordering Marion County), just west of the present town of 
Aynor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">They were listed on the 1860 census in Horry 
District, South Carolina. They had a large household, with the addition of a 
Tyler family residing with them (no known relationship) and with W. P. Lilly and 
Nancy Jones also residing with them (relationship to both is unknown).</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was unable to locate Barnabas, Susan nor any of 
their children on the 1900 census. I don't know if they moved away, or if they 
had died. I did find their son Robert B. Edwards back in Horry for the 1910 
census, and their children were born in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. Using 
the approximate birth dates and places, we can track the family (or Robert 
anyway) to Georgia by ca 1896, still there ca 1898, and still there ca 1900, and 
to Mississippi ca 1902 and to Alabama ca 1905, and back to Horry Co, SC by 1910. 
Since Robert made all these moves, could his parents and siblings also gone to 
one or more of those places?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Barnabas and Susan followed Robert, they may be 
listed on the 1900 census in Georgia, but I have no idea where specifically.

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><a name="william"></a>William M.

based on census analysis. His 1900 census entry shows October 1849, but that 
conflicts with his brother Gabriel, born December 1849. Also it does not 
completely agree with William's previous census entries. In 1860 he was 10 (born 
ca 1849/50), in 1870 he was 20 (born ca 1849/50). Both of these would work with 
Oct 1849 as a birth date, except he was <u>not</u> listed on the 1850 census 
with his parents, so not born yet. In 1880 he was 29 (born ca 1850/51). All 
combined, it seems like October 1850 is a much better fit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">He was born in Wayne Co, NC, in the Mount Olive
