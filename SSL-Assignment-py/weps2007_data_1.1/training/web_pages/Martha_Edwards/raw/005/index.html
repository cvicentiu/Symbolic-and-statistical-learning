THE EDWARDS FAMILY
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From 1450 England to 1850 Texas
<p>Before coming to Colonial American, the Edwards name was spelled EDWARDES.
<br>Widely believed, the earliest Edward in our family line is JOHN EDWARDES,
born circa
<br>1450 in England.&nbsp; His wife is unknown and his only child was ROBERT,
born circa 1475.
<p>*ROBERT EDWARDES, son of John, was born in England circa 1475.&nbsp;
His wife is
<br>unknown.&nbsp; Robert had two sons, *WILLIAM and John.
<p>*WILLIAM EDWARDES, son of Robert, was born circa 1500 and died in 1547.&nbsp;
His wife
<br>was Agnes who died in 1575.&nbsp; They had four known children, William,
who died 29 June
<br>1563, Henry, Christopher and *RICHARD.&nbsp; It was whispered among
some Tudor
<br>researchers that Agnes was mistress to King Henry VIII of England and
that the son
<br>RICHARD was fathered by King Henry and not by William.
<p>*RICHARD EDWARDES, son of William, was born March 1525.&nbsp; Richard
married
<br>*MARGARET BABB in 1560 and they had a son, William, born 09 Nov 1561.
<br>RICHARD remarried to Helen Griffith in 1663 and from their union came
*RICHARD,
<br>born 1581; John born 15 March 1565, died 06 Dec 1604, his wife was
Ellenor Pursloe;
<br>Elizabeth, born 1584; Thomas, born 1599; Abigail; Judith; Gwyn; Marie.
<p>*RICHARD EDWARDS, son of Richard, was born in England on 01 April 1581
and died
<br>31 August 1625.&nbsp; He married Ann whose last name is unknown about
1614 and she died 20
<br>Feb 1679 or 1680 in Hartford, Connecticut.&nbsp; Richard and Ann had
four children:&nbsp; Ann, born
<br>and died the same day, 30 July 1615;&nbsp; *WILLIAM, born 01 Nov 1618
in London, England,
<br>died circa 1680 in Hartford, Connecticut;&nbsp; John;&nbsp; Sarah.
<p>*WILLIAM EDWARDS, son of Richard was born 01 Nov 1618 in London.&nbsp;
The Edwards
<br>at that time were residents of Edwards Hall, near Cardiff, Glamorganshire,
Wales.
<br>WILLIAM had at least four sons, William (who settled in Jamestown,
Virginia), John,
<br>*THOMAS and Robert.&nbsp; Some accounts say the brothers came to the
colonies together and
<br>settled on land granted to them by the King of England.&nbsp; There
was a William Edwards, son
<br>of Reverend Richard Edwards of Wales, who came to Boston, Mass. with
his stepfather,
<br>William Coles in 1630 and settled in Hartford Connecticut about 1636.&nbsp;
This information,
<br>and the fact that WILLIAM, son of RICHARD, died in Hartford, Connecticut,
make it
<br>extremely likely that it was our ancestor WILLIAM who was the original
immigrant from
<br>Wales.
<p>*THOMAS EDWARDS, 1639-1711, was born at Edwards Hall, Glamorganshire,
Wales.
<br>He married Elizabeth Hall 1640-1699, daughter of Thomas Hall or Hael.&nbsp;
Thomas Hall
<br>was granted 77 2/3 acres of land on Manhattan Island in New York by
the dutch in 1642.
<br>The property will be detailed in this chapter as THE EDWARDS FORTUNE.&nbsp;
Thomas and
<br>Elizabeth had a son, *ROBERT.
<p>*ROBERT EDWARDS, son of THOMAS, was born in 1666.&nbsp; He married *MARGARET
<br>CUELIN in 1685.&nbsp; Robert and Margaret had a son, *THOMAS NATHANIEL.
<p>*SIR THOMAS NATHANIEL EDWARDS, 1690-1781, son of ROBERT, married Isabella
<br>or ELIZABETH DOWNING on her twentieth birthday, 12 March 1714.&nbsp;
She died in 1783
<br>at Edwards Hall.&nbsp; Lady Elizabeth's father was *SIR GEORGE THOMAS
DOWNING
<br>M.P., who was keeper of the Palace at Whitehall and the first resident
of Number 10
<br>Downing Street in London, the present-day home of the British Prime
Ministers.&nbsp; At the
<br>beginning of the Revolutionary War, SIR THOMAS, although very old,
was active in
<br>supporting the English government and became personally responsible
for goods bought in
<br>New York for the British Army.&nbsp; At about that time he died, and
Robert Edwards II
<br>administered the estate.&nbsp; SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH had eight
children:
<br>Robert II, Joshua, William, *THOMAS, Leonard, Jonathan, and Martha.&nbsp;
(Note:&nbsp; each of
<br>these children had many generations of descendants but they shall not
be identified in this
<br>family history except for the descendants of our own ancestor)
<p>Robert Edwards II, son of SIR THOMAS, was born 14 Feb 1716.&nbsp; As
the eldest son, he
<br>inherited the land granted to Thomas Hall/Hael.&nbsp; Robert was a
Captain in the British Navy.
<br>He leased the Hall property out for 99 years.&nbsp; In 1778, Robert
was returning to Wales to
<br>claim Edwards Hall after the death of his father, and during the voyage,
the ship he was on
<br>sank and all aboard were killed.&nbsp; Robert died a bachelor and therefore
his property was
<br>divided by his heirs - his six brothers and one sister.&nbsp; Their
descendants would have
<br>shared the division of his Manhattan Island property when the lease
expired.
<p>Joshua Edwards, 1718-1823, son of SIR THOMAS, lived to be 105 years
old.&nbsp; His wife
<br>was Rebecca Ward and they had 11 children born between 1755 and 1783.
<p>William Edwards, 1720-1801, son of SIR THOMAS, married first, Polly
Chermer, and
<br>second, an unknown woman.&nbsp; William had 17 children between the
two wives.&nbsp; He died in
<br>Long Island, New York.
<p>Leonard Edwards, son of SIR THOMAS, was born in 1725.&nbsp; He married
Alice Nightingale
<br>in 1744 and they had seven children.
<p>Jonathan Edwards, 1727-1816, had eleven children with his first wife,
Susan Ann Collins
<br>and eight children with his second wife, Mary Walker.&nbsp; Another
published history says that
<br>Jonathan also married a woman named Elizabeth and they had a son named
Samuel.
<br>Elizabeth died, and Jonathan and Samuel returned to Wales.&nbsp; When
Jonathan died, his son
<br>Samuel returned to Northampton, North Carolina to claim his inheritance
of his father's
<br>land.
<p>Jacob Edwards, 1729-1799, son of SIR THOMAS, had twelve children with
his wife,
<br>Effie Spears.&nbsp; Jacob was one of the three brothers who came to
colonial America circa
<br>1750 and settled in Tidewaters, Virginia but later returned to Wales
where he died.
<p>Martha Edwards, 1731-1799, had seven children with her first husband,
Thomas Nathan
<br>Wilson whom she married in 1752.&nbsp; Her second husband was a man
named White.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>*THOMAS EDWARDS (2), 1723-1790, son of SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH,
<br>was born in Coventry, England.&nbsp; He married Margaret Elizabeth
Nicholls on 23 Oct 1743
<br>and later married Anna Hiatt.&nbsp; THOMAS and MARGARET had at least
six children:
<br>*THOMAS, Robert, John, William, a daughter Frances, and another son.

THE FAMILY OF JUDGE THOMAS EDWARDS
<br>&nbsp;
<p>*THOMAS EDWARDS was born 1762 in Virginia, the son of *THOMAS EDWARDS
<br>and *ELIZABETH NICHOLLS. As an adolescent, he served in the American
Revolution
<br>and was present at the Battle of Yorktown (October 1781). He was living
in South
<br>Carolina by the mid 1790's.&nbsp; Writing his will 8 July 1825, he
mentioned four tracts of land
<br>in Greenville District and fifteen slaves. According to an inventory
of his estate, he
<br>posessed twelve slaves at death.&nbsp; Public service for Edwards began
with his appointment
<br>as a county court judge for Greenville (1796).&nbsp; Elected to the
House, he represented
<br>Greenville in the Thirteenth (1798-1799), Fourteenth (1800-1801), Fifteenth
(1802-1804),
<br>Seventeenth (1806-1808), Eighteenth (1808-1809), and Twentieth (1812-1813)
General
<br>Assemblies.&nbsp; While in the House, he was a member of the following
committees:
<br>privileges and elections (1798-1799, 1802-1804), religion (1800-1804,
1808-1809,
<br>1812-1813), judiciary (1802-1804, 1808-1809), pensions (1802-1804),
ways and means
<br>(1806-1809), reform (1806-1809), claims (1806-1808), public buildings
(1806-1808),
<br>grievances (1806-1808), and schools (1812).&nbsp; On December 12, 1799,
he was elected
<br>ordinary for Greenville, and he evidently held this post (despite his
legislative service)
<br>through 1808.&nbsp; His House service was not without controversy.
In 1802 he was cited by the
<br>state Senate for breach of privilege; in response to a disparaging
poem about himself,
<br>Edwards had posted a derogatory paper about Elias Earle in the Senate
chamber.&nbsp; A few
<br>year later, his election to the Seventeenth General Assembly was challenged,
but the
<br>committee on privileges and elections decided on 29 Nov 1806 that his
election was valid.
<br>Other offices he held included captain and/or major in the state militia.
<p>Thomas Edwards' home served as the first Post Office in a town now called
Traveler's
<br>Rest, South Carolina, located just north of Greenville.&nbsp; His first
home still stands and is
<br>occupied.&nbsp; His second home is also still in use.
<p>Thomas Edwards married *MARY ANN McCLANAHAN, daughter of *PETER
<br>McCLANAHAN. The marriage took place in Virginia. They were the parents
of at least
<br>eight children who were:

<p>"GRAYSON CO. EDWARDS FAMILY TIED TO TWO STATES' GOV...&nbsp;</center>

<p><font size=-1>James B.Edwards who served as Secretary of Energy under
Reagan, is a descendant of 4 children</font>
<br><font size=-1>orphaned in Grayson Co. in the 1890's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
James McClanahan Edwards, his great-great</font>
<br><font size=-1>grandfather,&nbsp; came to Kentucky from South Carolina
in the early 1800's, married and had a</font>
<br><font size=-1>family.&nbsp; Edward's grandfather, Harrison Thomas Edwards,
worked at rafting logs on the</font>
<br><font size=-1>rivers in the area.&nbsp; He was drowned 3/15/1890 when
his raft was wrecked in high water at</font>
<br><font size=-1>the mouth of the Green River.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was several
days later that his wife, Frances Isabell</font>
<br><font size=-1>Patterson Edwards, learned of her husband's death.&nbsp;
The bereaved widow was so</font>
<br><font size=-1>distraught, she prayed she might die.&nbsp; On March
27, twelve days after the death of her</font>
<br><font size=-1>husband, Isabell noticed a storm cloud building.&nbsp;
It was the season for tornadoes and she</font>
<br><font size=-1>feared the coming of a bad storm.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were
4 small Edwards children, one being a</font>
<br><font size=-1>babe in arms.&nbsp; Isabell put the 3 older children,
Flora, Ida and Wavey - in a potato hole in</font>
<br><font size=-1>the yard.&nbsp; Carrying her infant son , Ordie, she
went into the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm blew the</font>
<br><font size=-1>house over and a falling chimney stone killed Isabell.&nbsp;
The infant was found laying between</font>
<br><font size=-1>two other chimney stones, a third stone had fallen atop
those, forming a bridge over the</font>
<br><font size=-1>child.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordie's only injury was the loss of
an eye, while the other children were uninjured.</font>
<br><font size=-1>Ordie and his siblings were raised by their aunt and
uncle Joel Hume and Mary Elizabeth</font>
<br><font size=-1>Edwards Mahurin.&nbsp; After growing up Ordie Edwards
became a school teacher and married</font>
<br><font size=-1>Bertie Ray Heironomous.&nbsp; They had 2 sons:&nbsp;
Morton Thomas and James B. Edwards.&nbsp; The</font>
<br><font size=-1>family moved from KY to FL to SC where they still had
Edwards relatives.&nbsp; Both Edwards</font>
<br><font size=-1>sons went to dental school at the University of Louisville.&nbsp;
James B. Edwards was later</font>
<br><font size=-1>elected Governor of South Carolina, the first Republican
Governor of the state in 100</font>
<br><font size=-1>years. Flora, one of the girls saved in the storm, married
the paternal grandfather of former</font>

THE EDWARDS FORTUNE</font></b>
<center>
<p>Excerpts from "The Edwards of Northhampton":</center>

<p>". . . Basically, the story is this: Robert Edwards acquired two large
tracts of land on
<br>Manhattan Island, one of 66 acres, another of 77 acres (from Queen
Ann of England). He
<br>leased them in June 1778 to John and George Cruger (for 99 years).
Immediately thereafter
<br>he embarked for England and the ship and passengers were lost in a
terrible storm at sea.
<br>The lease expired in 1877 and title to the land and buildings on it,
then extremely valuable,
<br>reverted to his heirs that he named in the lease (his brothers and
sister).&nbsp; It was only
<br>necessary to identify the heirs, take possession of the properties
and divide the wealth
<br>among those living."
<p>Another story says that in about 1762, Thomas Hael, who later changed
his name to Hall,
<br>jumped from a British warship in the harbor at New York, swam ashore
and warned the
<br>Dutch that the Redcoats were coming.&nbsp; As a reward for his service
the Director General for
<br>the United Netherlands, who then owned New York, gave him a grant of
land.&nbsp; Hall's
<br>daughter Elizabeth had married Thomas Edwards. Hall's title was subsequently
confirmed
<br>when it became British territory and title passed to Thomas Edwards,
who died in 1703
<br>and then to his eldest son Robert Edwards who moved to Wales in 1704
with his family
<br>and died in 1738.&nbsp; His son Thomas Edwards III took title and died
in 1781, passing it on to
<br>his son Robert.
<p>An article in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer on Feb. 21, 1924 said
that the area included
<br>City Hall, Federal Building, Metropolitan Life Insurance Building,
the Singer building, the
<br>New York Stock Exchange, Trinity Church and Wall Street, and adds "which
is without a
<br>doubt one of the most valuable estates in the United States of America
without an owner
<br>and which the heirs are now fighting to regain."&nbsp; The 1924 article
stated "now said to be
<br>valued at $400,000,000."&nbsp; It's present value would be in the billions
of dollars.
<p>Since then, there have been variations in the story and many different
claims were filed to
<br>recover the property, the most popular being that Trinity Church has
hidden the deed in it's
<br>vault and took possession illegally.&nbsp; All over the country Edwards
claimants appeared.
<br>Trinity once said there were 5,000.&nbsp; Associations were formed
to lend organization and
<br>raise money and the groups consolidated in 1930 from Canada, Wales,
Mississippi,
<br>Oregon, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee, Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana,
South Carolina
<br>and a few other places.&nbsp; Some legitimately filed and argued cases
in court but there was a
<br>great misuse of the funds collected and people were taken advantage
of by unscrupulous
<br>con artists. In the 1930's. federal court ruled that the statute of
limitations had expired on
<br>the case and no further claims would be heard.&nbsp; As recently as
1967 scams to collect
<br>money from Edwards "heirs" were still being conducted.
<p>This and similar "estate" schemes flourish from time to time, fade away
and resurrect
<br>again, perhaps under a new family name. The only benefit to the Edwards
is that much of
<br>the family genealogy was preserved and research documented by family
members trying to
<br>prove a connection to the fortune.
