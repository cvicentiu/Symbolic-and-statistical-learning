&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested in some documents including in the book 'Edward's Legacy' by David Dean Edwards (1992),
that it was whispered among some Tudor researchers that Agnes was mistress to King Henry VIII of England
and that the son RICHARD was fathered by King Henry and not by William. But no solid proof has yet
to be found if it ever will be. Nor has solid proof been found that Richard was the son of William either.
It will be up to the researcher as to which line to follow. I believe that the evidence leans more towards
the fact that Richard was the "bastard" son of the King and Agnes and my documentation here will reveal
that line. It is documented that Agnes did have a son named Richard, but only 2 sons, William and Henry
are shown to be positively the sons of William. Richard is said to have kept his Edwards last name out
of shame for the indescency that his month engaged in.

<menu>
English composer and poet, who became Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal in 1561 and wrote
two plays for them. His five surviving songs, of which the most famous is In going to my naked bed,
show the influence of the Franco-Flemish style on English music before the arrival of the Italian madrigal.
Three keyboard arrangements of 3 part-songs (only one assigned to him, but the other two assumed to be his 
from his authorship of the words) survive in MS. 
</menu>
<menu>
English playwright
Born in Somerset, Edwards was educated at Oxford, receiving both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree. He 
considered the law as a career, entering Lincoln's Inn Field, but never took up the practice. Instead he
became master of the children at the Chapel Royal, where he created musical dramas that the children's choir 
could perform. The composition, 'Palamon and Arcite' was written for the Queen, and was performed at Oxford.
Sadly this has since been lost. The Queen was impressed with the piece, and intended to bestow a gift on 
Edwards, but he died soon after the performance. Little more is known of Edwards' life. Edwards' importance
as a playwright is that he instigated the basing of the English tragedy on the Latin classical model. His 
plays were classical in subject, but were set in a contemporary world. The only play of his that is still in
existence is 'Damon and Pithias' (1571), and he notes in this his intention to follow Horace in his decorum.
The play does not break up into parts in the way other plays of the time did in order, for example, to suggest
the passage of time. In this way his play has been seen as having a more natural effect. It has been noted 
that his true talent was, however, for comedy. He helped to develop the popular appeal of Elizabethan tragedy
in pioneering what was, in effect, comic relief in a play. One only has to look at the famous grave digger
scene in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' to see how great this influence was.
</menu>

<menu>
'Damon and Pithias' was a rhymed play about two Greek characters. Based on a Greek legend, it tells of how
they both insist in giving up their life for each other, as one of them is to be executed by Dionysus.
Dionysus is so impressed with their selflessness that he asks to join their brotherhood, and the execution 
is forgotten. Edwards also compiled the influential 'Paradyse of Dainty Devises' (published posthumously,
1576), a collection of minor poets of the 1560's and 70's.
</menu>

<menu>
Of Corpus Christi College and Christ Church, Oxford, was master of the children of the Chapel Royal, 1561. 
He composed Palamon and Arcite (now lost) for Queen Elizabeth's entertainment at Oxford, 1566. The Excellent
Comedie of ... Damon and Pithias (printed 1571) is his only extant play. He was the compiler of the Paradyse 
of Dainty Devises, published after his death (1576).

"*WILLIAM EDWARDS, son of Richard was born 01 Nov 1618/1620 in London.  The Edwards 
at that time were residents of Edwards Hall, near Cardiff, Glamorganshire, Wales. 
WILLIAM had at least four sons, William (who settled in Jamestown, Virginia), John, 
*THOMAS and Robert.  Some accounts say the brothers came to the colonies together and 
settled on land granted to them by the King of England.  There was a William Edwards, son 
of Reverend Richard Edwards of Wales, who came to Boston, Mass. with his stepfather, 
William Coles in 1630 and settled in Hartford Connecticut about 1636.  This information, 
and the fact that WILLIAM, son of RICHARD, died in Hartford, Connecticut, make it 
extremely likely that it was our ancestor WILLIAM who was the original immigrant from 
Wales"
