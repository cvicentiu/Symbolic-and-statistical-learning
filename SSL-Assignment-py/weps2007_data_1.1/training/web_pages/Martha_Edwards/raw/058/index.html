    <p><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFF00"><font size="2">THE 
    SEARCHERS was John Ford’s 115th<sup> </sup>feature film.&nbsp; That in itself is 
    a streak of prolific filmmaking that will likely <i>never</i> be 
    eclipsed.&nbsp; Consider also that – <i>when he began shooting the legendary 
    western </i>– he was already a four-time Academy Award winning director 
    (again, a feat that will likely not be bested).&nbsp; His career began in 1914 
    and he started to direct films in 1917.&nbsp; He would eventually go on to become 
    one of the most admired, cherished, and influential directors among the 
    Hollywood and critical elite.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s hard to find another director in the 
    last century of the cinema that could take claim to having such an 
    all-encompassing sphere of influence that Ford had.&nbsp; Within ten to fifteen 
    years of THE SEARCHERS debut a brand “New Wave” of filmmakers hailed it as 
    the film that influenced them the most.&nbsp; Considering that the list of this 
    talent includes everyone from </font></span>
    <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2" color="#FFFF00"><i>Paul 
    Schrader, Steven Spielberg, John Milius, Jean-Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa, 
    George Lucas, and Martin Scorsese</i> is noteworthy in itself.</font></span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">In the annals of the western genre, some 
    critics have hailed THE SEARCHERS as its greatest achievement.&nbsp; Recently, <i>
    Entertainment Weekly</i> proudly placed it high on its list of the Greatest 
    Films of All-time.&nbsp; The film has dated, to be sure, and our collective 
    consciousness responds to its themes a bit differently today than the 
    audiences of 1956, but THE SEARCHERS is Ford’s greatest film and – without a 
    doubt – a <i>masterpiece</i>.&nbsp; It was a <i>revisionist western</i> before 
    the word was even a thought in one’s mind and without the film there would 
    have been none of the future’s other classic, masterful revisionist 
    westerns, like Clint Eastwood’s THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES and his landmark 
    UNFORGIVEN.&nbsp; It also could be readily argued that THE SEARCHERS' influence 
    spanned even beyond the genre itself.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">There are clear-cut echoes of the film in 
    other works of such varying narratives.&nbsp; The virtues and moral and ethical 
    codes of Ford’s western can easily be spotted in films like Kurosawa’s SEVEN 
    SAMURAI, which the director himself admitted was an Eastern meditation on 
    Western themes.&nbsp; Even consider films that are such polar opposites, like 
    George Lucas’ STAR WARS: EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, where its hero’s journey 
    discretely hints at the journey of THE SEARCHERS' main character.&nbsp; STAR WARS 
    has often been called an intergalactic western in space.&nbsp; Some of Lucas’ 
    images very much reflect and pay homage to Ford’s film.&nbsp; An early moment in 
    A NEW HOPE - which shows a befuddled and shocked Luke Skywalker return to 
    his farm homestead to see his family killed and his home burnt to the ground 
    - eerily echoes a similar scene in THE SEARCHERS where it’s hero returns 
    home to see his family destroyed.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Perhaps even more clear cut is the 
    similarities between THE SEARCHERS to the films of Paul Schrader and Martin 
    Scorsese, more specifically, their 1976 collaboration, 
    <a href="http://www.craigerscinemacorner.com/Reviews/taxi_driver.htm">TAXI DRIVER</a>.&nbsp; A 
    cursory examination of the film may not yield any correlation with Ford’s 
    film, but the more one views TAXI DRIVER the more THE SEARCHERS appears to 
    be a very strong inspiration.&nbsp; The quest of THE SEARCHER’S main anti-hero, 
    Ethan, strongly mirrors the obsessive quest of TAXI DRIVER’s Travis Bickle.&nbsp; 
    It can be easily argued that Bickle is the more sociopathic of the two, but 
    both characters seem born from similar material.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Both live in societies that are decaying.&nbsp; 
    Both live in worlds where the only clear cut sign of empowerment is wanton 
    violence and force.&nbsp; More crucially, both men engage in their own 
    self-congratulatory and righteous missions to save women that they feel are 
    in need of a savoir.&nbsp; Both men are also isolated loners who see that the 
    only escape from their disparity is to embark on moral quests.&nbsp; For Ethan, it 
    is to rescue his teenage niece who he feels has been kidnapped and turned 
    into something abnormal and inhuman by Native “savages.&quot;&nbsp; For Bickle, he 
    also tries to save a young teenager from what he sees is a lifestyle of 
    dehumanizing influence.&nbsp; In his case, he is trying to rescue a hooker from 
    her pimp.&nbsp; Finally, in both men’s cases, there are some subtle hints that 
    both women are not entirely in need of saving, which further accentuates the 
    men’s own fierce determination and fanatical impulses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">That is what separates THE SEARCHERS from 
    other westerns that came before it.&nbsp; It marked a definite turning point in 
    the western genre, which in itself was on a downward spiral in terms of 
    widespread popularity.&nbsp; The film, like most of Ford’s famous works, is 
    applauded and loved for its cinematography and Vista Vision images of the 
    natural environment (no one framed the ethereal and gorgeous red stoned rock 
    formations of Monument Valley like Ford did).&nbsp; Yet, beyond the film’s 
    incredible stunning visuals are themes that dig deeper and resonate equally 
    deep where other westerns dared not to go.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">THE SEARCHERS, at its core, was a reflection 
    on racism and bigotry and how one’s own self-destructive and morally 
    backward outlook on society gets the better of him.&nbsp; The film also deals 
    with the notion and identity of the American character in the midst of 
    untamed wildernesses of post-Civil War life.&nbsp; More than anything, the film’s 
    protagonist, Ethan, mixes his own depression, anger, guilt, and bigoted 
    views together to fuel his desire to be a savoir.&nbsp; There is a complexity to 
    the nuanced themes that made THE SEARCHERS a very <i>atypical</i> western by 
    1950’s standards, which I guess is what makes it even more absorbing today.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">The film has also been labeled as being 
    almost <i>Homeric</i> in terms of it telling of a story that involves an 
    odyssey.&nbsp; That comparison is apt, in my mind.&nbsp; The narrative is a meandering 
    and epic journey of psychological torment and warped ideology.&nbsp; Ethan lets 
    his hate and anger spawn his own odyssey and journey to “free” his niece 
    from Natives.&nbsp; His quest spans over five years.&nbsp; Nothing stops this 
    man, not his advancing age, or the longevity of the journey, nor even the 
    harsh elements itself.&nbsp; Deep down, he <i>has to find and save this girl </i>
    from a society he deems as horrific for its sadism.&nbsp; The film’s tagline 
    alone on its poster speaks volumes about Ethan’s journey:&nbsp; &quot;</font><i><font size="2" color="#FFFF00">He 
    had to find her…her had to find her...he had to find her.”</font></i></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Now, it has also been argued whether or not 
    the film was liberal minded for its time about its portrayal of racism and 
    bigoted attitudes about Native Americans.&nbsp; <i>Does Ford chastise Ethan’s 
    fanaticism or celebrate it?&nbsp;</i> It is clear that the film’s so-called 
    “hero” is ethically unsound and morally loathsome.&nbsp; <i>He’s a jerk.</i>&nbsp; 
    There are two ways to do things in his mind – <i>his way</i> or <i>no way</i>.&nbsp; 
    Ethan’s impulses are brought upon by unyielding hatred of Indians and the 
    thought of his family being impregnated by their unholy lifestyle.&nbsp; There is 
    nothing modest or altogether wholesome about Ethan’s yearning to save his 
    niece.&nbsp; Yet, THE SEARCHERS comes across as being oftentimes ambiguous, which 
    makes it even more intriguing.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Certainly, the film is more emotionally and 
    thematically complex than the other westerns of its time.&nbsp; Certainly, most 
    genre pictures leading into THE SEARCHERS portrayed Native Americans in a 
    less than hospitable and magnanimous manner.&nbsp; Ford’s film, at least, tries 
    to dive into some heated waters that other films never did.&nbsp; To our 21st 
    Century eyes, Ethan is a vengeful, hateful, and despicable SOB that allows 
    his prejudicial world view cloud any sense of decency that he could have 
    had.&nbsp; It’s interesting to decipher whether 1950’s audiences – pre-Civil 
    Rights era – where inclined to share similar reactions to the film.&nbsp; I think 
    that, to a small degree, the film played off less as an exploration into 
    racism than it did a romanticized western of gallantry and heroism to the 
    50’s viewers.&nbsp; Perhaps it also did for Ford and its main star, John Wayne, 
    who up until his involvement in THE SEARCHERS was the very epitome of good, 
    old fashioned American gumshum, courage, and heroism.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Wayne may have won his first and only Oscar 
    decades later for TRUE GRIT, but his performance in THE SEARCHERS remains 
    his finest and most indelible.&nbsp; Wayne is often unfairly criticized as a “bad 
    actor.”&nbsp; <i>Those nitpicky critics miss the point altogether.&nbsp;</i> Wayne's 
    enormous strengths as an actor were neither in his vocal range nor in his 
    overall breadth as an actor.&nbsp; The man had very little range, per se, as an 
    actor.&nbsp; However, Wayne was a masterful <i>performer </i>in terms of being a
    <i>presence </i>on screen.&nbsp; Sure, his line delivery was often stilted and 
    wooden, but he often compensated for these deficiencies by his 
    larger-than-life visage.&nbsp; The Duke may not have been able to achieve 
    notoriety as a “great” thespian, but no one in the history of the cinema had 
    his on-screen vitality.&nbsp; When the Duke set out to save his niece in THE 
    SEARCHERS, you <i>believed </i>he was gonna die trying.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">More significantly, Ethan represents Wayne at 
    least attempting to play darker, edgier roles than he did in the past.&nbsp; He 
    starred in an unbelievable number of films under Ford’s tutelage before 
    SEARCHERS - <i>nine</i> to be exact.&nbsp; I think that the key to THE SEARCHERS' 
    overall effectiveness is primarily in terms of the scope and rugged 
    forcefulness of Wayne’s performance in it.&nbsp; He is the anchor to the whole 
    enterprise.&nbsp; Without his world-weary, beguiled, and spiteful performance, 
    the film would grind to an unsatisfying halt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wayne already had made his 
    name synonymous with the Western in films like THE BIG TRAIL, THE SPOILERS, 
    RED RIVER, <font color="#FFFF00">THE THREE GODFATHERS, THE FIGHTING 
    KENTUCKIAN, STAGECOACH, FORT APACHE, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, RIO GRANDE, 
    and HONDO.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, THE SEARCHERS was a stark turning point for the 
    actor.&nbsp; For the first time, he played a role that did not instantaneously 
    inspire our hero worship.&nbsp; Ethan was an anti-hero who was eventually forced 
    to let his racism lead him down a path to damned isolation and loneliness.&nbsp; 
    Wayne always professed that Ethan was his favourite and best character he 
    ever played in his 50-plus year career.&nbsp; He even named one of his sons Ethan 
    in homage to the film.</font></font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">The film was based on a novel of the same 
    name and was adapted for the screen by Frank S. Nugent.&nbsp; The novel, by Alan 
    Le May, was first serialized as a short story in the fall 1954 issues of the 
    Saturday Evening Post.&nbsp; Its first title was “The Avenging Texans” and it had 
    many similarities with the film’s script in terms of concerning a Comanche 
    kidnapping of a white girl in Texas in 1838.&nbsp; The film mirrors this story 
    and adds to it the obsessive quest of Ethan to save the white girl.&nbsp; Made 
    even direr is the fact that Comanches murdered most of his family and burned 
    their home to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Ethan, reaching a boiling point, sets out to 
    rescue his niece.&nbsp; However, he does not want to rescue her in the 
    conventional sense.&nbsp; He will <i>rescue </i>her by shooting her dead when he 
    finds her.&nbsp; <i>Why?</i>&nbsp; Because, in his mind, she has become some sort of 
    hell spawn of the devilish Comanche.&nbsp; Again, Ethan’s journey can invite 
    simultaneous condemnation and admiration, depending on you point of view.&nbsp;<i> 
    Should we admire the man?&nbsp;</i> After all, in the film’s famous last scene - 
    where he embraces Debbie (Natalie Wood) - there are some that point out that 
    the character is redeemed; hence, <i>his journey was just.</i>&nbsp; Yet, the man 
    is so twisted leading to that point that one could easily debate whether 
    it’s right to root for him in the first place.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Ethan was a Confederate soldier who takes 
    great pride in bragging that he never surrendered.&nbsp; After the war he becomes 
    a lonely wanderer.&nbsp; At the film’s opening he arrives at his brother Aaron’s 
    (Walter Coyt) and his wife Martha’s (Dorothy Jordon) home.&nbsp; Ethan is damaged 
    goods, to say the least.&nbsp; When he meets Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) he reveals 
    his bigotry by stating that he thought he was a half-breed.&nbsp; Martin claims 
    to be <i>one-eighth</i> Comanche.&nbsp; To Ethan, any inkling of Indian blood is 
    more than he likes.&nbsp; The story reveals that he rescued Martin when Indians 
    killed his family and he left him with Martha and Aaron to be raised.&nbsp; When 
    the home is destroyed and Debbie is missing.&nbsp; Martin desperately wants 
    to help Ethan, but he remains persistently rude and inflammatory towards him 
    throughout the mission.&nbsp; It’s hard to embark on a quest of revenge when one 
    of your party members – albeit very slightly – reminds you of the enemy.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Their quest continues for years.&nbsp; Throughout 
    it all Martin begs for Ethan to show mercy on Debbie, who he plans to 
    ruthlessly gun down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin asks for Ethan to show restraint.&nbsp; He wants 
    her to be alive when they find her. &nbsp;Ethan is stubborn and will not see any 
    way out of his quest.&nbsp; “Livin’ with Comanche’s ain’t livin’,” he screams back 
    at one point, utterly typifying his hatred and indignation of Natives as a 
    whole.&nbsp; I think that, for the first time, THE SEARCHERS presented a 
    legitimate and obvious racist in the form of its main character.&nbsp; Other 
    films have had subtle hints here and there, but Ford’s film reveals it to be 
    that much more obvious and evident.&nbsp; This film focuses so much more on this 
    element.&nbsp; In hindsight, Wayne’s choice to play such a vindictive and unruly 
    lot can be seen as courageous on his part.&nbsp; Wayne built a career of playing 
    chivalrous crusaders, so Ethan in THE SEARCHERS represented such a decided 
    change of tone and place for the actor.&nbsp; And – yes – he does not kill Debbie 
    in the end, <i>but is he really saved?&nbsp; </i>He takes Debbie home with him, 
    but is he honestly any less of a bigot?</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Beyond its themes and rich characters, THE 
    SEARCHERS remains a seminal visual masterpiece that only Ford could 
    construct.&nbsp; He had such a gift and unprecedented ability to frame his 
    westerns in luminous and sprawling vistas.&nbsp; He often made use of Monument 
    Valley and his compositions showed a painterly love of the scenery.&nbsp; His 
    command of the camera and using it to reveal mood is also noteworthy.&nbsp; Just 
    look at the scene where Ford reveals Ethan’s reaction to his family killed 
    and their home burned to the ground.&nbsp; Perhaps my favourite single shot 
    occurs at the end.&nbsp; Much like Eastwood would do later his own films – like 
    UNFORGIVEN – Ford shot Ethan from the POV from inside of the home looking 
    outside. The home inside is dark and shadowy and frames the lonely figure of 
    Ethan set against the landscape of the wilderness in the foreground.&nbsp; The 
    composition here says a lot about the character.&nbsp; Ethan is framed by the 
    darkness of the home’s doorway, which is a reflection on his deluded soul.</font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">Much of John Ford’s THE SEARCHERS has aged 
    rather obviously.&nbsp; Some of the subplots seem silly now and many of the 
    supporting performances are stilted and awkward.&nbsp; Yet, THE SEARCHERS should 
    be viewed in modern context as one of the greatest and influential of all 
    the westerns, if not a watershed film in the history of the medium.&nbsp; It 
    represented its legendary director at the peak of his narrative and 
    directorial powers.&nbsp; Furthermore, and most importantly, THE SEARCHERS 
    emerged as Hollywood’s first revisionist western where plucky idealism and 
    spirited values of the frontier hero were radically altered and changed.&nbsp;
    </font></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    <font size="2" color="#FFFF00">THE SEARCHERS also presented John Wayne not 
    as the hero but almost as a subtle villain, a deplorable racist that embarks 
    on a fixated and zealous mission that is fuelled by his hatred of Native 
    Americans.&nbsp; This type of character and the issues surrounding him are 
    nothing new to today's audiences, but they were fundamentally fresh and new 
    in 1956.&nbsp; That’s what makes the film so strong even 50 years after its 
    release.&nbsp; Its willingness to embark on social commentary in the western 
    genre during a time when these types of films were more about black and 
    white heroes (white men) and villains (Natives) is its most powerful trait.&nbsp; 
    Ford’s film deconstructed this narrow-minded sensibility about the 
    relationship between pioneer settlers and Native Americans.&nbsp; And, yes, The 
    Duke gives a <i>great </i>performance.&nbsp; Not by <i>relative</i> 
    standards, but by <i>his </i>standards.&nbsp; </font></span><!--mstheme--></font></td>
