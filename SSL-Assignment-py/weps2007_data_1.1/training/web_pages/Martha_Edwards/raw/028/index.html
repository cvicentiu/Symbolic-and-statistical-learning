	<td><b><span style="font-size:14">THE SAMS AND EDWARDS FAMILIES<br>PAPER WRITTEN BY<br>JOHNNY J. EDWARDS<br>(C)2002<br><br>&nbsp; My research of the Edwards family, specifically Abel Edwards and Polly Potts and their<br>descendants has taken me to a new area of interest.<br>&nbsp; The inter-married families of Sams and Edwards.&nbsp; This Paper will follow these two families on<br>their migration from Virginia to North Carolina(Pre-1796) to Early to Pre-Tennessee.<br>&nbsp; There are other surnames that were well known in Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee such<br>as Tilson, Clouse and Erwin.&nbsp; As of the completion of this paper these surnames have not been<br>researched in great detail.&nbsp; There is also a possibility that these families migrated together with the<br>Sams and Edwards families.<br>&nbsp; I first found the surname of Sams mentioned in the (1)Edwards Bible(after this will be referred<br>to as EB).&nbsp; The genealogical record within the bible concerning the descendants of Abel Edwards<br>and Polly Potts mentions the marriage between Littleberry Sams and Nancy Edwards born 1777. <br>The only documented occurrence found that mentions the union of Littleberry and Nancy is the<br>EB.&nbsp; This marriage is a problem with in the Edwards research circles because this family can't be<br>found in any other source other than the Edwards Bible.&nbsp; Is there proof other than the Edwards<br>Bible that documents the union between Littleberry and Nancy?&nbsp; Concrete proof, no. <br>Coincidences that proves to this researcher that it is to coincidental for the union to not have<br>taken place, yes.<br>&nbsp; The book titled, (2)&quot;THE SAMS FAMILY OF VIRGINIA&quot;(after this will be referred to as<br>SFOV) has many clues to the union of Littleberry and Nancy, but unfortunately does not<br>mention the union specifically. To address the possible reason why there isn't any mention of<br>Littleberry Sams and Nancy Edwards other than the written entry in the EB we must turn to two<br>other sources, the book SFOV and the land records of (3)Sullivan County Tennessee.<br><br>&nbsp; There are two (2)Littlebury Sams that could be the (1)Littleberry Sams which married Nancy<br>Edwards b.1777, daughter to Abel Edwards and Polly Potts.<br>&nbsp; (2)Littlebury Sams b.1754, son to William Sams Sr. b.1717 could possibly be the (1)Littleberry<br>Sams that married Nancy Edwards.&nbsp; Making the assumption that this L. Sams b.1754 did marry<br>Nancy Edwards he would have been 41 years of age when Nancy Edwards turned 18.&nbsp; It is a well<br>known fact that woman married very young at times in early America.<br>&nbsp; <br>{SFOV, PG.23}<br>Littlebury b.1754 probably died shortly after he was recorded on the tithables(Henry Co. Va.) <br>when he was 16 years of age as there are no records pertaining to him in any county or state.<br><br>&nbsp; The above entry might explain why Sams genealogical records don't show the union of<br>(1)Littleberry Sams and Nancy Edwards, Littlebury Sams b.1754 can't be found after 1770.<br><br>&nbsp; The other L. Sams is (2)Littlebury Sams b.1773, son of John Sams b.1749.&nbsp; Littlebury Sams<br>b.1773 married Elizabeth Burns in 1793.&nbsp; From this union there was a child named Littlebury<br>Sams b.1811. <br>The following are some possibilities concerning this L. Sams:<br>a.&nbsp; (2)Elizabeth Burns might have died after or before the birth of Littlebury Sams b.1811, E.<br>Burns dying before L. Sams b.1811 would&nbsp; make L. Sams b.1811 a child of another mother<br>maybe (1)Nancy Edwards b.1777.&nbsp; Then the marriage of Littlebury Sams b.1773 and (1)Nancy<br>Edwards b.1777 was obviously not recorded in any other source than the EB.<br>b.&nbsp; (2)Littlebury Sams b.1811 could have been the child of (Littleberry Sams and Nancy Edwards,<br>Nancy Edwards might have passed away and Littlebury Sams b.1773 then married Elizabeth<br>Burns in 1793.<br><br>(NOTE)<br>&nbsp; (2)Littlebury Sams b.1773 before the birth of his son Littlebury Sams b.1811 purchased 160<br>acres {SFOV, PG.26}, in Sullivan County Tennessee.&nbsp; The (3)Sullivan County Tennessee Deed<br>Records clearly mentions the deed transaction between Abel Edwards which married Polly Potts,<br>selling 160 acres to a &quot;Littleberry Sams&quot; in 1807.&nbsp; This is a very LARGE coincidence which has<br>occurred.&nbsp; The SFOV states that Littlebury Sams b.1773 purchased 160 acres in 1807 in the same<br>county of Sullivan, and Sullivan Co. Tenn. Deed records state that a Littleberry Sams bought the<br>same amount of acres in the same year.&nbsp; It is a fact that in early Tennessee in the year of 1807<br>there were only two Abel Edwards in the county of Sullivan, one of which was the father of<br>Nancy Edwards which (1)married Littleberry Sams, the other being the son of Abel Edwards and<br>Polly Potts, Abel Edwards b.1783 and in 1807 he would have been 24.&nbsp; There is no way of<br>knowing today just which Abel Edwards sold 160 acres of land to Littleberry Sams, I believe that<br>there are two reasons which Abel Edwards b.1783 was not the Abel which sold land to L. Sams. <br>One reason would be there are no deed transactions before the date of 1807 which documents the<br>transaction of the land between Abel Edwards and Polly Potts and their son Abel b.1783.<br>Secondly Abel b.1783 would be very young to have acquired all of this land with older brothers<br>having first rights on the land if it was given as a gift or legally left to them upon the death of their<br>father Abel Edwards.<br>Whether the land was sold to Littleberry Sams by Abel Edwards and Polly Potts or their son Abel<br>b.1783 doesn't matter.&nbsp; Littleberry Sams purchased 160 acres from either Abel Edwards and Polly<br>Potts or their son Abel b.1783.<br>{refer to the land records at the end of this paper for reference}<br><br>&nbsp; An even more interesting entry in the SFOV which adds more questions to the Sams and<br>Edwards relation is the mention of a &quot;Martha Edwards&quot; b.1763 which married William Sams Jr.<br>b.1755.&nbsp; This marriage was united in Henry County Virginia.&nbsp; I will remind the reader that Abel<br>Edwards and Polly Potts migrated to the early Tennessee area from Henry County Virginia.&nbsp; This<br>Martha Edwards, assuming that she was at least close to her husbands date of birth would be of<br>the same generation of (1)Abel Edwards b.1739/1755 which married Polly Potts.&nbsp; It could be<br>possible that this Martha Edwards which married William Sams Jr. b.1755 is related to Abel<br>Edwards which married Polly Potts.&nbsp; The above mentioned Martha could be the sister or<br>cousin or maybe the aunt of Abel Edwards.&nbsp; If this is true then we might have proof of the<br>father/uncle or the brother of Abel Edwards.&nbsp; {SFOV PG.44} It is written that the above Martha<br>Edwards was the daughter to a &quot;Thomas Edwards&quot; which died on November 17, 1790 and was a<br>neighbor of John Sams b.1749 which was the father to Littleberry Sams b.1773 the most probable<br>Littlebury Sams to have married (1)Nancy Edwards.<br><br>(NOTE)<br>&nbsp; (2)John Sams b.1749 lived on Turkey Cock Creek in what is now Henry County Virginia.&nbsp; This<br>could be the area where are Edwards lived before they were found on Snow Creek in Henry<br>County Virginia.<br><br>(NOTE)<br>&nbsp; (2)Martha Edwards Sams died on July 19, 1824 at the age of 61 years making her birth date<br>1763 as shown on her tombstone where she is buried next to her husband William Sams Jr. in the<br>Sams Family Cemetery, south of Jonesboro, Union County, Illinois.<br><br>(NOTE)<br>&nbsp; (2)William Sams Jr. b.1775 returned to Henry County Virginia to be married to Martha Edwards<br>b.1763 on 223 acres south of now Martinsville and east of Ridgeway on Simon Creek, a branch of<br>Matrimony Creek which flows into the Smith River east of Ridgeway where route 622 now<br>crosses Smith River.<br><br>&nbsp; In closing I now believe that (2)Littlebury Sams b.1754 and the (1)Littleberry Sams which<br>married Nancy Edwards to be one and the same person.&nbsp; The reason that this union was not<br>recorded in the Sams Family History is most likely lost to time.<br>&nbsp; I also now believe that the Martha Edwards b.1763 which married William Sams Jr. b.1755 to be<br>directly related to my 5th great grandfather Abel Edwards which married Polly Potts.&nbsp; I also<br>believe that Martha Edwards father Thomas Edwards to be related and very possibly the father or<br>uncle to Abel Edwards, father to Nancy Edwards b.1777 wife to Littleberry Sams.<br>&nbsp; I lastly believe that our Edwards lived prior to Snow Creek Henry County Virginia 1783 near<br>the Sams family of Virginia in Henry County and possibly {SFOV PG.23} &quot;Old Rapphannock<br>County in the tidelands, or possibly Spotsylvania County, or lastly Pittsylvania County Virginia&quot;.<br>&nbsp; I do believe that there is much needed research on the Edwards family in early Henry County,<br>specifically researching the possible ancestral tie between Abel Edwards which married Polly<br>Potts and Martha Edwards father Thomas Edwards which died on November 17, 1790.<br><br><br><br>WRITTEN BY<br>JOHNNY J.

Jones received land from Thomas Jones in 1844 could not find a<br>John/John R./J.R. Jones through 1900 as selling land to anyone.&nbsp; The land might have been kept in<br>family, or sold by family members in&nbsp; small acres.&nbsp; We will Probably never know.&nbsp; Also the land<br>might have been willed, or another type of distribution of this land could have happened after<br>1844.&nbsp; Another possibility's the descendants of John R. Jones left the land and no one bought the<br>land after they left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>NOTE#2:&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no mention of a Squire/or &quot;S&quot; Jones selling land, 50 acres through 1900. <br>This person might have willed this land to his descendants or there was some other type of<br>distribution of this 50 acres after Squire Jones sold it or willed it.&nbsp; Another possibility is that the<br>descendants to Squire Jones just left the land and no one bought the land after they left.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>-NOTE#3:&nbsp; There was allot of activity with deeds on February 21, 1825 in Sullivan co. Ten. <br>There might be some correlation between the four (4) different deeds mentioned during this day. <br>I believe that these deeds do have something in common with Littleberry Sams selling 31 acre<br>parcels, which probably was the original land Abel Edwards purchased in 1780.<br>1.&nbsp; There were the following deeds signed on Feb. 21, 1825.<br>a.&nbsp; Obediah Sams 20 acres to John R. Glover<br>b.&nbsp; Obediah Sams 7 acres from A. Vancevender (see Note#7)<br>c&nbsp;&nbsp; Obediah Sams 29 1/4 acres from&nbsp; Littleberry Sams<br><br>-NOTE#4:&nbsp; There were four (4) different deeds completed during this day.&nbsp; There is some kind of<br>association between these four (4) different deeds.&nbsp; Possibly because of a deceased family<br>member.&nbsp; Unknown at this time.<br><br>-NOTE#5:&nbsp; (Item 14 and 15) have something to do with one another and the association between<br>the &quot;T-bond&quot; and the deeds of these two (2) items do have some hidden meaning.&nbsp; The names of<br>these people who were involved in (item 14 and 15) are not the same people who are mentioned<br>in (item 11), with exception to Susanna Sams.&nbsp; Susanna Sams mentioned in (Item #11) could be<br>the same person mentioned in (Item 14 &amp; 15).&nbsp; What makes me think that the people mentioned in<br>(item 11, 14, 15) are some how related, and that these land transactions are probably from the<br>original land that was once owned by Abel Edwards is because Littleberry Sams on October 6,<br>1838 sold four (4) 31 acre plots to four (4) different people which equal a total of 124 acres, and<br>on February 21, 1825 Littleberry Sams sold 29 1/4 acres which puts the total of 153 acres that<br>Littleberry Sams sold from the original 160 acres which he purchased from his father in law, my<br>5th great grandfather Abel Edwards. <br>This is under the assumption that the multiple deeds in question are from the original land<br>purchase from Abel Edwards.<br> <br>-NOTE#6:&nbsp; The earliest land transaction that Littleberry Sams was involved in was the transaction<br>with his father in law Abel Edwards, which he purchased 160 acres.&nbsp; There are only 7 missing<br>acres from the original 160.&nbsp; <br><br>-NOTE#7:&nbsp;&nbsp; In note 6 there is mentioned 7 missing acres from the original 160 which Abel<br>Edwards sold to Littleberry Sams.&nbsp; On February 21, 1825 An Obadiah Sams bought 7 acres of<br>land from Abraham Vandevender on the Holston River.&nbsp; Ironically Littleberry Sams ended up<br>selling to an Obadiah Sams 29 1/4 acres on the same day as O. Sams bought 7 acres from A.<br>Vandevender.&nbsp; Could this be some how the missing 7 acres of land and again why are all of these<br>deeds going on at the same time?&nbsp; <br><br>I believe that this is very likely the missing 7 acres missing from the total of 160 acres that<br>Littleberry Sams purchased from Abel Edwards in 1807.<br><br>-NOTE#8:&nbsp; Obediah Sams Sr. on September 29, 1854 bought land from Edmond Carrier, 31<br>acres.&nbsp; This 31 acres is probably one of the three 31 acre parcels that Edmond Carrier purchased<br>(see item 14-15) from three different people in 1849.<br><br>-NOTE#9:&nbsp; After 1854 (see item 16) there is not another mention of 31 acres parcels sold or<br>conveyed in any other manner.&nbsp; The owners of the 31 acre parcels possibly willed the land to<br>family, or there was some other type of distribution of the acreage.&nbsp; Another possibility is the<br>families who owned the 31 acre parcels left the land and no one bought the land after they left.<br><br>-NOTE#10:&nbsp; Littleberry Sams isn't mentioned anywhere in Sullivan County Tennessee after<br>October 6, 1838, (see Item 12).&nbsp; <br>Questions:<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to Littleberry Sams 31 acres which he purchased from Wilson Sams?<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who did Wilson Sams purchase his 31 acres from?<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did he sell his 31 acres to Littleberry Sams on the same day that he sold his (4) pieces of<br>land of 31 acres each?<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br>.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOURCE PAGE<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDWARDS BIBLE OWNED AND LOCATED WITHIN THE APPALACHIAN ROOM,<br>MARS HILL COLLEGE, MARS HILL NORTH CAROLINA.<br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SAMS FAMILY OF VIRGINIA (SFOV).&nbsp; WRITTEN BY CRAWFORD SAMS.&nbsp; OUT<br>OF PRINT.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; LAND RECORDS OF SULLIVAN COUNTY TENNESSEE</span></b></td>
