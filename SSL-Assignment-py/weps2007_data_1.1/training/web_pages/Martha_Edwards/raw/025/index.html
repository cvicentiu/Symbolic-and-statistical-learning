<div class="caption">More Than A Game: Former NFL player/coach Herm Edwards leads a youth football camp and throws in some values, too.</div>

<div class="body">
  <p>All the New York Giants had to do was drop a knee to stop
  the clock in the few remaining seconds of a big game back in
  1978, and they’d have the victory. But the coach sent a highly
  unusual play in from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>The Giants quarterback turned around to look at the running
  back. Both were shaken up by the call. The football snapped
  out before the quarterback was ready and bounced from his
  hands.</p>

  <p>A young hotshot on the Philadelphia Eagles defense scooped
  up the loose football before anyone else figured out what had
  happened. He ran it in for a 26-yard touchdown and stole the
  win. The play, now known as the “Miracle in the Meadowlands,”
  is one of the most famous in the history of the National
  Football League.</p>

  <p>The hotshot defender was Herm Edwards. Now fifty years old
  and in his fourth season coaching the New York Jets, he’s
  still a young hotshot, as far as NFL head coaches are
  concerned.</p>

  <p>“You make your own luck,” says Edwards, not talking only
  about a play made long ago. “If you work hard and you’re
  willing to sacrifice things, good fortune will come your
  way.”</p>

  <p>Edwards was five in 1959, when his father was transferred
  to Fort Ord and the family moved to Seaside. Edwards soon
  began playing football around the neighborhood.</p>

  <p>“To become a professional was his dream,” says Martha
  Edwards. “From little on, he was so determined. That’s all he
  ever thought about.”</p>

  <p>At the time, kids did not play tackle football until tenth
  grade. But Edwards almost never got a chance to strap on pads.
  “When I was young, she was petrified,” he says.</p>

  <p>“He came home one day and said, ‘Mom, you have to sign
  these papers, so I can play on the football team.” recalls
  Martha Edwards. “I said, ‘What! I’m not going to sign. I don’t
  want you to play that kind of game.’”</p>

  <p>“As a football coach, you’re not going to let a great
  athlete not play football,” says Dan Albert, the coach at
  Monterey High, and now mayor of the city. Albert spoke with
  Martha Edwards, and she eventually relented.</p>

  <p>Edwards played both defense and offense, but favored the
  offensive wide receiver position—he just loved catching
  passes. But he didn’t get to do a lot of that at Monterey.</p>

  <p>“Back when Dan Albert was head coach, if you threw five
  passes in a game, you were lucky,” Edwards says. “I actually
  had more interceptions than receptions as a wide
  receiver.”</p>

  <p>His prowess as a pass defender caught the attention of top
  colleges. Dick Vermeil at UCLA tried to recruit him. But in
  1972, Edwards chose to attend UC Berkeley. In his sophomore
  year, he returned to Seaside and played a year at Monterey
  Peninsula College. He went back to Berkeley for another year
  before finishing at San Diego State. He set a Berkeley record
  with four interceptions in a single game. After college, he
  was acquired by the Philadelphia Eagles, with Dick Vermeil as
  head coach.</p>

  <p>Edwards was recognized for more than just his talent for
  interceptions. The opportunity to coach football emerged. “It
  was almost like I was pushed in that direction by people in
  the league,” he says.</p>

  <p>When he retired as a player in 1986, he took a coaching
  position at San Jose State. Two years later, he returned to
  the NFL as a scout with the Kansas City Chiefs. In 1996,
  Edwards became assistant head coach for the Tampa Bay
  Buccaneers, and in 2001, he became head coach of the Jets.</p>

  <p>Edwards showed his stuff right out of the blocks, taking
  the Jets to the playoffs in both of his first two years.</p>

  <p>“You see the way he carries himself, the way he acts, and
  just his hunger for the game, his hunger to win,” says Wayne
  Chrebet, the Jets’ wide receiver. “He’s the kind of guy who
  makes you a better player and a better person.”</p>

  <p>“Herman has always been a guy who has given back to the
  community,” says Joe Bommarito, director of the Herm Edwards
  Football Camp. “We are fortunate to have a guy like him who’s
  never forgotten where he came from.”</p>

  <p>Edwards will run a free, one-week-long football camp
  beginning June 28 at CSU Monterey Bay, teaching the
  fundamentals of football, and more than that.</p>

  <p>“His message is the same,” says Bommarito. “He’s teaching
  the NFL guys, and he’s teaching the young guys. It’s all about
  doing the right thing and being a good person.”</p>

  <p>Says Edwards, “I always tell young people that in life God
  blesses everybody with some talent. You have to find your
  talent. Once you find it and if you have passion that goes
  with that talent, along with opportunity, you’ll have a chance
  to be successful.”</p>

  <p><b>The 9th Annual Herm Edwards Football Camp runs June
  28–July 2. Registration is free, limited to 600, ages 9–17.
