<p class="normal">Martha was the only child of Mary McCulloch's first, short lived, marriage to George Byrd. She is included as she is a half sibling to Mary's later family with Hugh Edwards.<br><br><B>1885</B> The <a href="http://www.toxteth.net/marriage/images/mary%20mcculloch%20george%20byrd.jpg">marriage of George Byrd and Mary McCulloch</a> was on 2nd&nbsp;August 1885 at The Parish Church, Liverpool. &nbsp;(This is assumed to be St. Nicholas, Chapel Street) George was aged 21, a batchelor, &nbsp;rivetter. &nbsp;His father is also named George Byrd, a shipwright. &nbsp;Mary McCulloch is  aged 19, a spinster, her &nbsp;father Charles McCulloch is a labourer. The couple are both shown as living in Shannon Street. This was a small street (long since demolished) behind what is now the Irish Centre, between Brownlow Hill and Mount Pleasant. Both bride and groom were able to sign their names. Witnesses were &nbsp;Francis James Temple and Catherine Watts.<br><br>As Mary married Hugh Edwards in November 1889 George must have died around 1887/8, no details of his death  have yet  been looked for or found.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="normalbold">1881</span> A George Bird (Geonney) of the right age, is at <a href="http://www.toxteth.net/census/1881/121%20warwick%20street.htm">121 Warwick Street</a>. &nbsp;He is an apprentice Riveter (in 1885 on his marriage he is a riveter so think this must be our man).&nbsp; He is a step-son of Martha Geonney (George's own daughter was to be called Martha, so again seems to tie in).&nbsp; Martha Geonney (40) was a mariner's wife.&nbsp; There is no sign of her &nbsp;husband but he may well have been at sea. George Bird (16) is with two brothers John Robert (14) and Louis(2)&nbsp; John Robert  is also an apprentice riveter.&nbsp; The two older boys are both shown as step-son (i.e. sons of Martha), Louis is shown as a son.&nbsp;(It is assumed that the relationships shown in the census are to husband as head of house rather than to the acting head as husband is not there.&nbsp; All children born in Toxteth Park). This 2 year old Louis becomes important, as he later marries Martha Bird, to whom he was step-uncle (and more distantly related than a first cousin would have been).<br><br>
<span class="normalbold">1874</span> There is a <a href="http://www.toxteth.net/marriage/images/martha%20billows%20louis%20geonney.jpg">marriage</a> of Louis Geonney  and Martha Billows, West Derby 8b 714 June quarter 1874.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name Geonney is  unusual, there are only four Geonneys in the entire 1881 census (for the whole UK) and they are all the ones at Warwick Street.&nbsp;The certificate shows the marriage on June 9th 1874, after banns, at Church of St. Michael. Ages are given only as 'full', however Martha would have been about 34.&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis is a batchelor, Martha Billows is a widow. Their address is&nbsp;Lamport Street (see 1871). &nbsp;Louis's father is Cloude Geonney, a farmer. Martha's father is Robert Leath, a joiner. &nbsp;The word 'Leath' is unambiguous but must be Leech. &nbsp;Martha was able to sign her own name, Louis was not. The witnesses were Ann Leech and Sampson Cordon.
<p class="normal"><B>1871</B> The Billows/Byrd family are at <a href="http://www.toxteth.net/census/1871/27%20lamport%20street.htm">27 Lamport Street for the census</a>, and the situation becomes more complex. Matha Billows is a widow aged 30 living with her 56 year old mother Margaret Leech, her brother Henry Leech (14) and her children John R Billows (3), Elizabeth E Byrd (7), George Byrd(5) (there also appears to be a married sister to Martha, Ellen Dixon, 19). It seems that Martha is in fact nee Leech, married George Byrd bore Elizabeth Byrd&nbsp;and George Byrd. Widowed. Married Mr Billows, bore John R Billows, widowed, &nbsp;married for the third time to&nbsp;Louis Geonney (1874). &nbsp;John R Billows becomes John Robert Bird (Geonney) by 1881 census and George Bird becomes George Byrd(Geonney)!<br><br> <font color="blue">An Internet search for the name Geonney, suggests that it could be either Italian, or Polish, perhaps Spanish.  Italian seems most frequent. &nbsp;In the 1871 census I have seached widely for both&nbsp;Geonney and Joney (using soundex) and looked at all people with the forename&nbsp;Louis in Lancashire. There is no trace of him. &nbsp;It seems that Louis Geonney may have been a sailor of foreign origins.</font></p>

<p align="left" class="normal"><font color="blue" face="Arial">To include with Martha Bird is suggestion that she may have (also?) married someone called Llewelyn-Jones and been/become a money lender. &nbsp;<br>By one marriage or another she bore at least three children.</font></p>
