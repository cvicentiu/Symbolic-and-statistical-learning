18th Alabama Infantry Regiment
The 18th Alabama Infantry Regiment was organized at Auburn, 4 Sept 1861, with men recruited from Butler, Coffee, Coosa, Covington, Jefferson, Pike, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa counties, and the field officers were appointed by President Jefferson Davis. A few weeks later, it went to Mobile, by way of Huntsville, and was there brigaded under Gen'l Adley Hogan Gladden of Louisiana, with the 19th, 20th, 22nd, and 25th AL regiments, Jones Mitchell Withers' Division. Ordered to Corinth in March 1862, the regiment was there brigaded under Gen'l J. K. Jackson of Georgia, with the 17th and 19th AL regiments. The 18th fought the first day at Shiloh and was detailed to escort the brigade of USA Gen'l Benjamin Mayberry Prentiss, which it had largely aided to capture, to the rear, and it did not take part the second day. After the battle, the regiment being without field officers and was for a short time under officers detailed for the purpose. It was under fire at Blackland, and soon after was sent to Mobile under the command of Gen'ls James Edwin Slaughter and Alfred Cumming. There the 18th remained until April 1863, when it rejoined the Army of Tennessee, in a brigade with the 36th and 38th AL regiments, and the 9th AL Battalion (the latter being soon after raised to the 58th AL regiment, and consolidated subsequently with the 32nd AL), commanded successively by Gen'ls Henry DeLamar Clayton of Barbour, James Thadeus Holtzclaw of Montgomery, and Col. Bushrod Jones of Perry. At Chickamauga, the 18th lost 22 out of 36 officers, and 300 out of 500 men, killed and wounded. At Missionary Ridge, the 18th was engaged, and lost about 90 men, principally captured. Having wintered at Dalton, it began the Dalton-Atlanta campaign with 500 effective men, and fought all the way down to Jonesboro, losing constantly in killed and wounded, but with no severe loss at any one place. It lost very nearly half its number during the campaign, and rendered effective service. The regiment went with Gen'l John Bell Hood into Tennessee, and lost about 100 at Franklin, principally captured. When the army moved to the Carolinas in February 1865, the regiment was ordered to Mobile, and placed in the field works at Spanish Fort. It participated prominently in the siege of that place several weeks later, with some loss and escaped when the defenses were evacuated. It surrendered at Meridian, MS, 4 May 1865, with the military department. The army numbered 858 men in January 1861; it lost 20 k and 80 w at Shiloh, and 56% of the 527 engaged at Chickamauga. It had 209 casualties in Chattanooga and was reduced to 275 effectives in November 1864.

Notes for MARTHA ANN EMILINE EDWARDS:
Story told by Caldonia Maddox to (Living) Maddox about 1961-
Peter and Jencie Edwards were the grandparents of Martha Emaline Edwards. Grandmother Jencie was the original owner of a ring.Martha's father,Steve Edwards, fought with the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Grandmother Jencie feared greatly that he would not return.Steve's father,Peter,however,never gave up hope and often put aside choice things to eat to save until Steve came home.One day Peter told the family he felt this day would be the day of Steve's return. The war had been ended for some time, but the weary soldiers had only thier tired worn feet to bring them home.But on this day,Peter's feelings proved true. The tired worn creature they saw coming was indeed their beloved, Steve. Steve met and married Pelonia Brown.Martha was their oldest child. Pelonia was a happy gay young woman but her health soon failed due to successive childbirths.She died at the birth of her last child. The children were left in the care of young Martha who was only 11 years old. She had gone with the other children to a relative's house the night before their mother died.They came home in the morning and the new baby had arrived. They thought all was well. Martha and Will went to do the milking and when they got back to the house their mother was dead. Martha worked hard to care for her brothers and sisters. Soon her father went to work for the railroad and were left more on their own. Grandmother and Grandfather Brown tried to help all they could, but they were not close by.Everyone loved Marthy as she became a second mother to the little ones.Others came to depend on her care and she was often called to see after then when new babies came. Years later one of Aunt Mary Emily Brown's sons came to visit her. He hugged her and said God bless your old sweet soul.I remeber how you used to cook and wait on us, every time a new baby came. Life was hard for the,Steve,as time went on, became and often whipped them severly, when he came home if things were not done to his liking. This cruelty left a mark on Martha and on her death bed, her mind wandering back she said "our daddy wasnt good to us" When Martha reached young womanhood she left her father's house and went to live with her Aunt Jane Brown. Jane had been badly scalded in a train accident, which claimed the lives of her two small children. Jane was a sister to Steve and had married Newt Brown,Pelonia's brother. Martha stayed with her and cared for her and her family for some time. Winter came, and one day one of the older boys, Steve Brown, noticing Martha had no shoes bought her some and gave them to her. Aunt Jane became very angry at this and said she would but anything she wanted Martha to have. Martha was hurt by her aunt's attitude and made plans to leave. Martha left and went to live with her Grandmother and Granfsther Brown. Martha married Mannon. He was a widower with 6 young children.Martha became an instant mother.Grandfather Brown died in the year of 1899. at this time Martha and Mannon were living temporarily with them. After his death, Grandma Brown would walk up and down the porch looking toward the cemetery saying well pretty soon now I'll be going along too. On the following Wednesday. Martha had cooked dinner and the family had eaten.Grandma Brown said Marthy that was a mighty fine dinner and I ate alot but I dont believe I can get waway from the table.She leaned over the table and would have fallen but they helped her to the bed.She died a few hours later,following her husband in death by a week. Grandmother Jencie was half Cherokee Indian.Her father who was full blooded was driven from his home in Alabama with the others of his nation. His wife and kids were not permitted to go with him. Peter Edwards outlived his wife.He was fond of his grandchildren and dorve many miles with horse and carriage to visit. He bought a doll and brought it to Caldonia it was the only doll she ever owned.
