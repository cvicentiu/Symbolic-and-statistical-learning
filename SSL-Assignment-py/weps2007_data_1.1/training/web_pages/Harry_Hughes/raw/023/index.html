        Honors Former Governor Harry R. Hughes and Senator Jennie M. Forehand 
        at Annual Legislative Breakfast</strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Annapolis, 
        MD-</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UMBI 
        hosted its annual Legislative Breakfast and Awards Ceremony in Annapolis, 
        MD today, honoring former Governor Harry Hughes and Senator Jennie M. 
        Forehand for their commitment to UMBI. It was under the Hughes administration 
        that the Maryland Biotechnology Institute was created in 1985, with the 
        support of Senator Jennie Forehand, who served on the appropriations committee 
        at the time. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More 
        than 100 people attended the early morning event; including several members 
        of the Maryland General Assembly and biotechnology industry stakeholder. 
        In addition, University System of Maryland Regents Cliff Kendall and former 
        Governor Marvin Mandel, State Treasurer Nancy Kopp, and UMBI founder Dr. 
        Rita Colwell also participated in the program. The award ceremony was 
        one of many events marking UMBI&#8217;s 20th anniversary, which correlates 
        with this fiscal year (July 1, 2005- June 30, 2006).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prior 
        to the award ceremony, attendees were able to speak with UMBI education 
        and outreach coordinators to learn more about the Institute&#8217;s loaner 
        lab program &#8211; a program which provides Maryland science teachers 
        and their schools with free biotech lab kits which cover seven different 
        research areas. The loaner lab program benefits all regions of the state 
        and has become a very popular program. Officials also had the opportunity 
        to meet some of the new hires at UMBI&#8217;s expanded Shady Grove facility 
        and pick up informational literature focusing on the new GMP training 
        and biomanufacturing program and plant and insect transformation cores. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
        the reception Dr. Jennie Hunter-Cevera, president of UMBI, lead the awards 
        ceremony. During her remarks she commended Senator Forehand for her commitment 
        to learning about the science and supporting the biotech community. &#8220;From 
        the moment we decided that we wanted to expand our facilities in Shady 
        Grove, Jennie was there to help us and has since become a staunch supporter 
        for biotechnology.&#8221; Dr. Hunter-Cevera noted that Senator Forehand 
        has served on the NIH bio-safety committee for more than 14 years and 
        last year co-sponsored the Biotechnology Investment Act of 2005.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s 
        been a pleasure to be a part of UMBI&#8217;s success,&#8221; said Senator 
        Jennie M. Forehand. &#8220;UMBI is really the icing on the cake, with 
        increasing industry partnerships, research, and seminars -- and with Jennie 
        (Hunter-Cevera), the sky&#8217;s the limit! UMBI really is an asset to 
        the State, and we&#8217;re wholeheartedly excited about what lies ahead.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, 
        Dr. Jennie Hunter-Cevera recognized Former Governor Harry Hughes, noting 
        that he was &#8220;responsible for creating the ad hoc Committee on high 
        technology in Maryland back in 1982 which concluded that a strategic investment 
        stimulating high technology in Maryland would yield strong economic development 
        benefits to the State.&#8221; She commended former Governor Harry Hughes 
        for putting funds in his budget to support the creation of UMBI in 1985, 
        as well as being a key member of the Maryland Families for Stem Cell Research 
        campaign and a lifelong advocate for the protection of the Chesapeake 
        Bay. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Governor 
        Hughes is the muscle behind this operation, he put the funds in his budget 
        to support us and is an amazing individual who believes in science and 
        research, and getting people the help and treatment they deserve,&#8221; 
        said Dr. Hunter-Cevera. &#8220;We are very pleased that he agreed to serve 
        on our 20th Anniversary Honorary Executive Committee and to present him 
        with this award today. Without Dr. Colwell&#8217;s vision and the financial 
        backing of former Governor Hughes, there would be no UMBI.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Governor 
        Hughes, also a former University System of Maryland Regent, jokingly said 
        he knew he was in trouble when John Toll and Rita Colwell came to see 
        him, and he was right because they &#8220;got him.&#8221; In a more serious 
        moment, he commended Dr. Rita Colwell for her vision and Dr. Hunter-Cevera 
        for her current successes, noting how proud they both must be. &#8220;Biotechnology 
        is amazingly important to our state, and I congratulate all of you on 
        your accomplishments,&#8221; said former Governor Hughes as he accepted 
        his award.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
        the presentation of the leaderships awards Dr. Hunter-Cevera recognized 
        UMBI faculty members who received patent awards in the past fiscal year, 
        as well as faculty honored for service to the scientific community. She 
        concluded the program by inviting everyone to attend UMBI&#8217;s 20th 
        Anniversary Gala event set for June 3, 2006. </font></p>
