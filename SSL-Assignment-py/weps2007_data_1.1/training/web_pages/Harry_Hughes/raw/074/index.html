professional baseball player, HARRY HUGHES was               the 57th governor of Maryland. He served two terms, receiving more               than 700,000 votes in each election.</p>            <p>Hughes graduated from the University of Maryland in 1949. He earned               his law degree from George Washington University. Two years later               he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates and went on to               serve in the Maryland State Senate and as the state's first Secretary               of Transportation.</p>            <p>Elected governor in 1979, Hughes left a record of progress in social               reform, environmental protection and fiscal responsibility. Under               his administration, Maryland launched a program to save the Chesapeake               Bay and became a national leader in efforts against drunk driving.               Capital investment by new and expanding business averaged $1 billion               a year, while unemployment remained below the national average.               Hughes submitted a balanced budget each year to the General Assembly               while launching the greatest tax-relief program in the state's recent               history.</p>            <p>The Hughes Administration also created the National Institute Against               Prejudice and Violence in Baltimore, established a new department               of Employment and Training, and appointed more women and minority               citizens to the judiciary and key government posts than any previous               administration.</p>            <p></p>            <p><strong><a name="20"></a>CARLISLE H. HUMELSTINE</strong><br>              PRESERVATIONIST AND STATESMAN</p>            <p>CARLISLE HUMELSINE dedicated nearly 35 years to historic preservation               and as a national leader in cultural affairs. Winston Churchill,               King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and the Shah of Iran were among those               he entertained during the course of his tenure at the Colonial Williamsburg               Foundation where he served as president from 1958 to 1977 and chairman               until 1985. Under his leadership, Colonial Williamsburg became one               of America's most popular historical attractions and developed a               broad base of financial support.</p>            <p>Even before his long career at Colonial Williamsburg, Humelsine               distinguished himself in World War II military service, reaching               the rank of full colonel at age 29 and earning both a Distinguished               Service Medal and a Bronze Star. Following the war, he joined the               State Department for six years, serving four secretaries of state               including Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles.</p>            <p>As a trustee at the National Geographic Society, the National Gallery               and the Smithsonian as well as chairman of the National Trust for               Historic Preservation, Humelsine proved himself to be, as in the               words of one of the many tributes paid him: &quot;a champion of               this nation's cultural heritage.&quot; The conservationist, who               compiled an impressive record of public service, died in 1989 at               the age of 73.</p>            <p></p>            <p><strong><a name="21"></a>HUGH NEWELL JACOBSEN</strong><br>              WORLD RENOWNED ARCHITECT</p>            <p><br>              HUGH JACOBSEN is widely recognized as one of the top architects               in the world. Since starting his own business in 1958, the buildings               he has designed have earned more than 110 awards for design excellence.</p>            <p>Jacobsen has built commercial and institutional structures in countries               around the world. They include the American University in Cairo,               Egypt; the University of Michigan Alumni Center in Ann Arbor; an               addition to the U.S. Capital; renovations to the Renwick Gallery;               and the American embassies in Paris and Moscow.</p>            <p>Yet Jacobsen is perhaps best known for his modern homes that abstract               traditional styles, such as the Buckwalter House in Pennsylvania.               Many of his minimalist building can be found in historical districts.</p>            <p>Jacobsen has built some 400 homes during his 40-year career. After               graduating from Maryland in 1951, the former Diamondback cartoonist               headed to Yale, where he earned a master's in architecture in 1955.               Three years later, he opened his firm in Washington, D.C., and today               employs 11 professionals.</p>            <p>Last year, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. , honored               Jacobsen with a retrospective of his work. &quot;I've had the most               wonderful life, you must leave some record that you went through               this thing.&quot;</p>            <p></p>            <p><strong><a name="22"></a>ALBIN O.

At the time, UMBC was               located on a 450-acre farm owned by the state.</p>            <p>Kuhn remained chancellor of UMBC until 1971 but continued in that               capacity for the city's campus for eight years. During that time,               Kuhn continued a building program to provide more space for teaching               and research.</p>            <p>Kuhn went on to become executive vice president for the University               System of Maryland in 1979 and retired in 1982. That year, UMBC               named the Albin O.

When he returned to Maryland, he was named associate professor               in the agronomy department and in 1948 was appointed professor and               head of the department. Kuhn later became assistant to the university's               president and later executive vice president, which entailed expanding               the university to Baltimore City and County.</p>            <p>With booming enrollment at both campuses, it's easy to see the               Kuhn accomplished those goals. </p>            <p></p>            <p><strong><a name="23"></a>WILBUR MONROE (MUNRO) LEAF</strong><br>              FERDINAND: A LASTING LEGEND</p>            <p>MUNRO LEAF, author and illustrator of dozens of children's books,               is best remembered for his signature character, Ferdinand, the Spanish               bull who preferred smelling flowers to fighting in a ring in Spain.</p>            <p>One Sunday afternoon in 1935, Leaf decided to write a children's               story so that his close friend Robert Lawson (a relatively unknown               illustrator) could show his talents. In less than one hour, Leaf               composed the beloved 800-word story as it stands today, nearly 60               years later.</p>            <p>When published by Viking in 1936 as The Story of Ferdinand, the               book sparked controversy. With the Spanish Civil War waging, political               critics charged it was a satirical attack on aggression. In Germany,               Hitler order the book burned while fellow dictator Stalin granted               it privileged status as the only non-communist children's book allowed               in Poland. And India's spiritual leader Ghandi called it his favorite               book. In spite of the notoriety, the nation embraced the peaceable               bull.</p>            <p>That same year, Leaf published his second most popular book, Manners               Can Be Fun, illustrated with the notorious &quot;watchbird&quot;               stick figures who observe the behavior of boys and girls. Since               Leaf's death in 1976 at age 71, Ferdinand continues to charm children               worldwide as the simple story is retold in more than 60 language               translations.</p>            <p></p>            <p></p>            <p><strong><a name="24"></a>GEORGE J.

So               Laurer took his high school equivalence exam and was admitted to               the University of Maryland.</p>            <p>Some 30 years later, around 1980, most of the world was benefiting               from the advice of that instructor. That's when the Universal Product               Code, a 12-digit bar code began popping up in grocery stores.</p>            <p>After graduating from Maryland in 1951, Laurer joined IBM as a               junior engineer. He worked up the ranks to senior engineer and spent               15 years as an engineering manager. In 1969, he returned to his               &quot;first love,&quot; the technical side of engineering, as a               senior engineering manager. A couple of years later, Laurer was               assigned the monumental task of designing a code and symbol for               product identification for the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council.</p>            <p>With competition from the likes of RCA and Pitney-Bowes, in 1973,               Laurer's proposal was accepted and radically changed the retail               world.</p>            <p>Since then, the UPC Council, Inc., has enhanced the code, thanks               to Laurer. He added a 13th digit for country identification, a price               check digit for the domestic market and another for the European               market.</p>            <p>Laurer retired from IBM in 1987.

His lifetime               of achievements, battling inequities, is proof. At 27, he successfully               fought university segregation when he became the first African American               admitted to the College Park campus in 1950, after filing a petition               to force the university to accept him as a graduate student in sociology.</p>            <p>Later, in 1970, he became the first African American elected to               the United States Congress from Maryland, where he led a distinguished               six-term career in the U.S. House of Representatives (Md.-7th District).               His constituents were those he came to know as director of the Baltimore               City Community Action Agency, as part of President Johnson's War               on Poverty.

He authored the Philippine Independence Act in 1934               and the Armed Services Unification Act in 1949, and served as first               chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>            <p>In 1950, Tydings chaired the committee which investigated Senator               Joseph McCarthy's charges that the State Department was employing               Communists. At the close of his six-month investigation, he publicly               exposed the charges as baseless and McCarthy a fraud.</p>            <p>At the time, that outspoken stance cost Tydings his re-election               later that year as McCarthy clandestinely directed the Senate campaign               of his Republican opponent, John Butler.</p>            <p>When Tydings died in 1961 at age 70, a newspaper account stated:               &quot;He crossed swords with Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and               Harry Truman, and stood up against the Communist-hunting tactics               of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy at a time when few others challenged               him.&quot;</p>            <p></p>            <p><br>              <strong><a name="35"></a>EVELYN PASTEUR VALENTINE</strong><br>              EDUCATOR AND ENTREPRENEUR</p>            <p><br>              EVELYN PASTEUR VALENTINE has held just about every title in the               education profession: teacher, assistant principal, principal, department               head, administrator and adjunct professor. Today she is president               and CEO of The Pasteur Center for Strategic Management.</p>            <p>Valentine began her career as a teacher in Beaufort, N.C. When               she moved to Baltimore, she held a variety of roles in the city's               public school system and, in 1974, was elected Teacher of the Year               for Maryland and then a National Teacher of the Year Merit Award               Winner.</p>            <p>Valentine also was an assistant professor at Loyola College in               Baltimore and an adjunct professor at Morgan State University, also               in Baltimore. Along the way, she earned her M.S. in family life               and child development and an Ed.D. in education and business management               from the University of Maryland.</p>            <p>Valentine's doctoral dissertation, a strategic model for education,               paved the way for The Pasteur Center for Strategic Management, which               was founded in 1987. The Baltimore firm provides management planning               and leadership training to business, education, government and public               service organizations.</p>            <p>Valentine lent her management skills to the University System of               Maryland in 1988 when she helped the system form the University               of Maryland Alumni Association. She served as the new association               president in 1990.</p>            <p>In 1997, the university recognized Valentine's service to the University               and honored here with the Ralph J. Tyser Medallion.</p>            <p></p>            <!-- InstanceEndEditable --><br>            <br></td>	</tr>	</table>	</td>	<td width="15" background="marginrightbody.gif" valign="top"><img
