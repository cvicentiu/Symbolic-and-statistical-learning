						<pre class="release">    ORLANDO, Fla., May 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Hughes Supply Inc.
(NYSE: <A HREF="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=HUG" onClick="var s=s_gi(s_account); var hd1 = document.getElementById('headline'); s.tl(this,'o',getLinkName('Company Sanpshot'));" >HUG</A>) announced today its Board of Directors has appointed its
President, Tom Morgan, to the additional post of Chief Executive Officer.  Tom
Morgan has been President and COO of Hughes for the past two years.  For
continuity and for the company to benefit from his years of experience, David
Hughes, former CEO of Hughes, will remain as Chairman of the Board.
    (Photo:  <A HREF="http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990803/HUGLOGO" target="_new">http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990803/HUGLOGO</A> )
    In Hughes' 75-year history, the Company has had only three other Chief
Executive Officers.  The first CEO in 1928 was Russell Hughes, the second was
Harry Hughes, and in 1974 David Hughes was elected to the office of CEO.
    Tom Morgan started at Hughes in March of 2001 having served as CEO for
EnfoTrust Networks in Atlanta, Value America in Charlottesville, VA and US
Office Products in Washington, DC.  Prior to those positions, Tom worked for
Genuine Parts Company in Atlanta from June 1975 until February 1997.  He is a
graduate of the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor of Science Degree in
Business Administration.
    David Hughes said, "Tom Morgan was recruited two years ago to serve as
President and COO.  Prior to joining Hughes, Tom learned the distribution
business with more than 20 years at Genuine Parts Co.  In his short time with
us, Tom has led the way to continued improvement and has proven to be the
person we need to take our company to the next level."
    Tom Morgan added, "I am honored to assume this role.  David has been an
exemplary role model for me and an incredible leader for this company.  His
are big shoes to fill, but I am looking forward to the challenge.  I am
passionate about the wholesale distribution industry and I feel strongly about
the potential of Hughes Supply."
    Under David's leadership, the Company grew from a local distributor of
building supplies with sales of $30 million to a diversified national company
with over 450 branches in 34 states and sales exceeding $3 billion.  The
growth of Hughes Supply from a small regional company to one of the nation's
largest wholesale distributors of construction materials is in large part due
to the vision and drive of the Hughes family and in particular, David Hughes.
The success of their strategy is evident in the fact that the Company has
continued to succeed during a period of economic downturn.  Tom will adopt
David's growth strategies while applying his own experience and skills to move
the company forward.
    Hughes Supply, Inc. is a wholesale distributor of construction and
industrial materials with over 450 locations in 34 states.  During 2003,
Hughes is celebrating their 75th anniversary. For additional information on
