southernmost stretch of Chesapeake Bay.<IMG SRC="patpiper6_21d.jpg"

<P>Here, along exposed flats in Rose Haven, more than 40 volunteers with
boots or muddy toes gathered at low tide on two mornings last week to set
in 4,000 water plants.</P>

<P>The gathering of neighbors plus students from Anne Arundel Community
College and Southern High School marked the latest chapter in a successful
partnership that has, out of sheer force of will, created a two-acre park
where a batch of Bayfront houses would have been planted.</P>

<P>Sloshing volunteers laughed and played as they embedded the roots of
spartina, bayberry and panic grasses. But panic had been the reaction in
the community five years ago at the prospect of three or more houses subverting
one of the finest Bay views around.</P>

<P>The owner of nearby Herrington Harbour South Marina, Steuart Chan<IMG SRC=
"girlsgrass6_21d.jpg" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="303" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" BORDER="2" ALT="Southern Senior High School students">ey, was entertaining
the idea of selling the valuable, north-facing land that looks out on Herring
Bay.</P>

<P>But a razor-sharp organizing campaign saved the valuable land and provided
a textbook example of partnership.</P>

<P>First, the purposeful folks of Rose Haven persuaded Chaney that there
was another way. And Chaney understood the value of operating a green business.</P>

<P>Next, as in any preservation battle, the landowner or developer had to
be compensated. That happened when Anne Arundel County agreed to buy the
land for $326,000.</P>

<P>Then, you've got to have workers. The County Department of Parks and
Recreation has stayed with the project, providing workers to prepare the
land and $800 for plants. Stephen Ailstock, who runs Anne Arundel Community
College's environmental center, put together the seeding plan. Plants were
grown by developmentally disabled at Provident Center in Arnold. Ray Ciupeck
of Southern High School provided a batch of volunteers. The Chesapeake Bay
Trust contributed $4,000 to the project.</P>

<P>&quot;What makes this project unique is the type of partnerships involved,&quot;
said Ailstock, as he supervised the crew.</P>

<P>Chaney did not take his money and run. He has been a key adviser, contributing
thousands of dollars in assistance by arranging a marine contractor to haul
in tons of rip-rap for a breakwater.</P>

<P>It isn't over. A late spring storm may yet wash away the tender grasses,
requiring more planting. Over the summer, poison ivy and phragmites must
be kept under control. In the fall, once the shoreline is stabilized, Ailstock
will direct the planting of indigenous shrubberies along the slopes leading
down to the water.</P>

<P>The Concerned Citizens Committee of Rose Haven will sponsor fundraisers
along the way to construct paths, benches, bird houses and duck houses,
all of which will shape a passive park. On this sensitive land, saved by
an uncommon partnership, you won't see barbecue pits and magnets for rip-roaring
partiers.</P>

<P>As committee secretary-treasurer Susan Wills put it: &quot;This won't
be a party platform. The habitat we want to attract is wildlife.&quot;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Sheriff Rawlings Expected Trouble; He Found It</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>by James G. Gibb</FONT></P>

<P>Sheriff Stephen Rawlings stood before William Brown's door Wednesday.
His task: evict William, Susanna and the rest of the Brown household. Rawlings
came fully armed, expecting trouble. And he found it. William Brown vacated
his stately brick mansion, situated on a high bank overlooking the South
River, but only bec<IMG SRC="jimgibb6_21d.jpg" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT=
"286" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2" ALT="Jim Gibbs">ause
of the sheriff's &quot;strong hand and armed force.&quot;</P>

<P>William Brown lived and worked in London, one of Anne Arundel County's
few towns during the 1700s. A carpenter, cabinet maker, ferryman and innkeeper,
Brown joined the likes of Alexander and Elizabeth Ferguson (tailors and
innkeepers), Dr. Richard Hill (physician, merchant, ship-owner, and amateur
botanist), David Macklefresh (merchant and &quot;Lord Mayor&quot; of London)
and others in building this lively port town.</P>

<P>Only Brown's house, part of the 23-acre county-owned National Historic
Landmark and park in Edgewater, and portions of another colonial dwelling
encased within a modernized, privately owned house, survive from this historic
settlement. At least above ground. Volunteer archaeologists and the professional
staff of The Lost Towns of Anne Arundel Project, joined by hundreds of school
children each year, bring to light vestiges of colonial London Town.</P>

<P>County archaeologist Dr. Al Luckenbach conceived of The Lost Towns Project
in 1995. He directs the program, drawing financial and moral support from
County Executive John Gary, the County Council and several government agencies
and private foundations. In 1995, Dr. Luckenbach reported his findings from
the &quot;lost town&quot; of Providence, the precursor of Annapolis, in
his book Providence, 1649. You can only read about the research at Providence,
but you can visit the ongoing excavations at London Town, even join in the
nearly daily discoveries.</P>

<P>Most of what we know about the people and places of London, Providence
and other lost towns comes from archaeology. No maps of Anne Arundel's early
towns survive, and the few documents that mention such events as William
Brown's forcible eviction in 1780 are often cryptic. The written record
provides few details about London, a port that bustled with sailors and
merchants, local planters, slaves, small farmers and a variety of artisans.
But these people, and those of the other lost towns, left a rich material
record of their lives.</P>

<P>Some evidence of the area's past can be seen in the old houses that dot
the landscape. Forests and fields, even the road system, have something
to tell about how Maryland's earliest European inhabitants lived and what
they thought. Most of the information, however, lies below lawns and houses,
and in some cases beneath parking lots, roads and shopping malls. That's
where the archaeologist comes in, and that's where the discoveries begin.</P>

<P>Since 1995, The Lost Towns Project has unearthed the remains of at least
three buildings and thousands of artifacts at London. Some of the objects
and one of the buildings date to the late 1600s, a time when Annapolis was
a small hamlet and London still served as the county seat (1684&shy;1695).</P>

<P>Beginning with my next 'Letter from London,' I will share with NBT readers
the latest finds from London, Providence, and several other town sites,
as well as some of the insights that Director Al Luckenbach and other project
team members bring to our understanding of Colonial Maryland. And yes, I
will tell you what became of William Brown and his family.</P>

a Bay Hero</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#747474" SIZE=+1>Twenty years after leaving Maryland's
State House, Harry Hughes continues to work for the Bay.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>hen he was governor 20 years ago, Harry Hughes
signed the first Chesapeake Bay Agreement, showing the will and the way
to turn the tide.<IMG SRC="harryhughes6_21d.jpg" WIDTH="147" 
HEIGHT="211" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"></P>

<P>Later, Hughes began the striped bass moratorium that led to the world-recognized
recovery of Chesapeake rockfish. The phosphate detergent ban and the Critical
Area Commission came about during his two terms in office.</P>

<P>Long after he left the governor's office, Hughes stayed in the forefront
of Bay protection: he is chairman of the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy
and, in a role brimming with controversy, he chaired the Blue Ribbon Citizen
Pfiesteria Action Commission last year.</P>

<P>Hughes' continuing work for the Chesapeake Bay has won him one of the
region's highest honors: the Truitt Environmental Award, named in honor
of pioneer Chesapeake Bay scientist Reginald V. Truitt.</P>

<P>&quot;This award pays special tribute to Harry Hughes' exceptional environmental
contributions to Maryland,&quot; said Donald Boesch, president of the University
of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, which sponsors the award.</P>

<P>The honor was presented at a black tie ceremony last week in Annapolis.</P>

<P>Tom Horton, Baltimore Sun columnist and prolific writer on Bay issues,
was part of a committee making nominations for the award. Horton, who, like
Hughes, grew up in Caroline County, recalled the former governor's &quot;fascinating
evolution&quot; in environmental issues.</P>

<P>&quot;He was a guy that grew up along the shore, but the Bay and the
outdoors and the environment never were on his radar screen,&quot; Horton
said.</P>

<P>But politics was at the center of that radar screen, and as governor,
Hughes first saw the worries about the declining Chesapeake and then the
rewards from taking brave stands.</P>

<P>&quot;He may go down as the best governor the Bay has ever had,&quot;
Horton said. &quot;I'm almost as impressed by the fact that he continues
to keep his hand in it when he doesn't have to anymore.&quot;</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor446286"></A><FONT SIZE=+3>The Way to Go When You Need
a Tow</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>t's happened to everybody, usually with your boss
or your prissy sister-in-law on board. Your boat is running great and suddenly,
nothing.</P>

<P>&quot;This will just take a second,&quot; you say bravely, grabbing your
tool box. You drop anchor just in case it takes a little longer.</P>

<P>Next thing you know, an hour has gone by. Your boss is looking at his
watch and your sister-in-law (or brother-in-law) is asking questions in
a whiny voice.</P>

<P>Who you gonna call?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>If you call for a tow, Boat/U.S. offered these bits of advice in a
  news release last week called &quot;What to Know Before You Need a Tow.&quot;
  <LI>Carry the correct size and type of anchor with sufficient line to keep
  you in one spot while you try to fix the problem or wait until help arrives;
  <LI>If possible, use a VHF radio to call for assistance. You can hail your
  towing service by name over channel 16 or call the U.S. Coast Guard or
  the marine operator to help you contact a towing firm. A cell phone is
  a good back-up but has limitations, especially if you are out of range;
  <LI>Give your position by chart, GPS or LORAN coordinates, nearby navigation
  aids or local landfalls. Describe the situation clearly, giving the nature
  of the problem, your boat name, size, distinguishing features and number
  of people on board;
  <LI>Understand that once a towing vessel gets underway, you're committed
  to a verbal contract. If you get going again on your own, advise the tow
  captain immediately to stand down or you may have to pay for the tow;
  <LI>Remember that tows are costly; $125 per hour is the national average
  and the meter runs from the time the tow boat leaves its dock until it
  returns. The average towing bill for a recreational vessels last year was
  $271.

<P><A NAME="anchor454119"></A><FONT SIZE=+3>Dear Reader: Will You Write
Our Father's Day Feature?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ith Father's Day just around the corner on June
21, NBT needs your help. We've gotten the kind of challenge you usually
hear on public radio and television, where a corporate sponsor holds out
a big carrot to urge on listeners or viewers. Alexander's of Annapolis Salon
&amp; Day Spa is our corporate sponsor, and you're the partner we're seeking.</P>

<P>The Challenge: Wring our hearts with a story of how your dad set the
standard for fathers. Send charming pictures, too.</P>

<P>The Prize: Seeing your story in print.</P>

<P>There's a Grand Prize, too: Your dad - or you - enjoys free a &quot;Gentleman's
Choice&quot; package at Alexander's Salon &amp; Day Spa.</P>

<P>Here's how to do it. Tell your story in your own words, anywhere from
200 to 500 and more if you need them.</P>

<P>It's a good idea to start with a memory. From there, show us how your
dad marked the path of your life in footsteps you could follow. Use words,
actions and interactions to make us feel the way you do. Send pictures,
too, so we can see just what you mean.</P>

<P>Show us the time and place, and if that's Chesapeake Country, all the
better.</P>

<P>Ideally, you'll send a print and electronic copy, but if you have to
handwrite or use a typewriter, do so.</P>

<P>Usually, a good story gets even better if you re-read and polish it once
or twice, and correct your spelling. But sometimes - often it's when you're
telling a truth so familiar that you know it like the back of your hand
- you get lucky, and all the words are just right.</P>

<P>How many will we print? That depends on how many we get and how well
you tell your story. We'd like to print every one of them, and we'll try
to do just that.</P>

<P>Who gets the grand prize? We expect all your stories to be so good that
we're going to make our corporate challenge-giver Alexander himself, be
the judge.</P>

<P>The Grand Prize Winner will be announced in our June 18 issue, when all
the stories will appear.</P>

<P>Deadline: 5pm Wednesday, June 10 (by hand, mail or fax, email or computer
disk).</P>

<P>Photos should be originals or high-resolution copies. They may be black
and white, color, negatives, slides or electronic, but not photocopies.
All photos will be returned.</P>
