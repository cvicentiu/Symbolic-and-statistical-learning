						<pre class="release">    ORLANDO, Fla., March 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Hughes Supply Inc.
(NYSE: <A HREF="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=HUG" onClick="var s=s_gi(s_account); var hd1 = document.getElementById('headline'); s.tl(this,'o',getLinkName('Company Sanpshot'));" >HUG</A>) Board of Directors announced today its plans for CEO succession.
Effective at its annual meeting in May, the Board will appoint its President,
Tom Morgan to the additional post of CEO.  In Hughes' 75 year history, the
Company has had only three other Chief Executive Officers.  The first CEO was
Russell Hughes, the second was Harry Hughes, and in 1974 David Hughes was
elected to the office of CEO.  For continuity and for the company to benefit
from his years of experience, Mr. Hughes will remain as Chairman of the Board.

    David Hughes said, "Tom Morgan was recruited two years ago to serve as
President and COO.  Prior to joining Hughes, Tom learned the distribution
business with more than 20 years at Genuine Parts Co.  In his short time with
us, Tom has led the way to continued improvement and has proven to be the
person we need to take our company to the next level."
    Mr. Hughes has had a long and distinguished career with Hughes that began
on a part-time basis while attending high school.  After high school Mr.
Hughes attended the University of Florida where he earned his Bachelor's
degree in Finance and Juris Doctor degree in Law.  Upon graduation from law
school in 1967 he joined the Company on a full-time basis.  In 1972, Mr.
Hughes was promoted to the office of President and in 1974 to the office of
Chief Executive Officer.  In 1986 he was elected to the additional office of
Chairman of the Board.
    Under his leadership, the Company grew from a local distributor of
building supplies with sales of $30 million to a diversified national company
with over 450 branches in 34 states and sales exceeding $3 billion.  The
growth of Hughes Supply from a small regional company to one of the nation's
largest wholesale distributors of construction materials is in large part due
to the vision and drive of the Hughes family and in particular, David Hughes.
During the period when Mr. Hughes was Chief Executive Officer the Company
began a growth and operating strategy that was designed to (i) increase its
revenues and profitability and (ii) reduce the impact of economic cycles on
the Company's profitability.  The success of this strategy is evident in the
fact that the Company has continued to succeed during a period when so many
companies have not.
    Mr. Hughes is an active member of the Orlando community and is the Past
Chairman of the Orlando Regional Healthcare System and the Economic
Development Commission of Mid-Florida.  In addition, Mr. Hughes has served as
President of the Central Florida Builders Exchange, a Director of the Central
Florida Research Park, and is a member of the Florida Council of 100, Florida
Tax Watch, Florida Bar Association, and serves on the Capital Campaign Cabinet
for the Boys & Girls Club of Central Florida.  Mr. Hughes is a member of the
Board of Directors of SunTrust Banks, Inc., Brown & Brown Insurance, and
Darden Restaurants, Inc.
    Hughes Supply, Inc. is a wholesale distributor of construction and
industrial materials with over 450 locations in 34 states.  During 2003,
Hughes is celebrating their 75th anniversary. For additional information on
