A WITNESS</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">By<b> Nancy Olson</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">On March 2, 1979, former Senate Harold E. Hughes 
appeared, at my urging, before the Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Drug 
Abuse which he had once chaired, this time as a witness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Subcommittee was then chaired by Senator Donald W. 
Riegle, Democrat of Michigan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">It took a lot of convincing before he agreed to testify.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now, Nancy,&quot; he bellowed,&quot; you know that I have no 
intention of coming up to the Hill to try to advise my former colleagues about 
how to do their jobs. I am spending my full time, as you are well aware, working 
for Christ.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I bellowed back: &quot;Senator, there is nothing better you 
could do for Christ than to come up here and plead for the poorest of his poor, 
the drug addicts in the ghettos and the alcoholics on skid row.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Senator Hughes' statement before the Subcommittee 
follows, with his digressions from the prepared text in <i>italics,.</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be back 
	with you this morning.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When I was first approached about appearing here 
	today I refused, because when I left the Senate four years ago it was to 
	devote myself full time to the service of the Lord. Because of that 
	commitment, I have refused any request which I felt would detract from that 
	goal.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But I was reminded by someone close to me that 
	perhaps the way I could best serve Him on this morning of March 2, 1979, 
	would be to appear before you to plead for the poorest of His poor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Two thousand years ago, Jesus was often in the 
	company of the social outcasts of that day - the prostitutes, the tax 
	collectors, the lepers. Were He to walk on earth today, I believe that it 
	would be with the social outcasts of this day we would find Him - the 
	alcoholics on the skid rows of our cities, the drug addicts in the empty 
	tenements, the lonely and the lost.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So though I fully realize that alcoholism is no 
	respecter of persons, and that alcoholism touches those from every walk of 
	life, it is for that three to five percent of our Nation' alcoholics on skid 
	row - and the drug addicts in the ghettoes - for whom I make my plea this 
	morning.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, another reason I hesitated to accept 
	your invitation is that I am no longer knowledgeable about the current 
	issues - specific authorization levels, the needs of the research community, 
	nor the latest prevention techniques. There are many in this room far more 
	able than I to advise you on that.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Perhaps I can be most helpful to you if I give you a 
	brief review of some of what I learned during the six years I sat in your 
	chair.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">A century ago an English author, Samuel Butler, 
	wrote a book about an imaginary Utopian society called Erewhon.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And in this mythical society, when people got sick, 
	the authorities put them in jail.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In 1969, when the subcommittee was formed, we did 
	not have to look far to find modern-day Erewhons. Only the District of 
	Columbia and the State of Maryland had decriminalized public drunkenness and 
	provided for treatment in the public health system.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In this Lenten season it is interesting to note that 
	the court decision which led to that change in Washington was called the 
	Easter decision. In Easter v. District of Columbia, the courts held that a 
	homeless alcoholic could not be punished for his public intoxication. Mr. 
	Easter was one such. He had been incarcerated several hundred times before 
	Peter Hutt of the law firm of Covington and Burling, used him as a test 
	case.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In every other State in the Union, alcoholic 
	citizens were being thrown into jail for the sole crime of being sick in 
	public. And many of them died in those jails from lack of medical attention.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And I should add, Mr. Chairman, that it is not only 
	men. Women, too, are among their numbers. Perhaps we are not aware of the 
	women on skid row because we rarely see a woman sleeping in the gutter.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Senator, they do not need to. A woman can usually 
	find a bed for the night - by one dreadful method or another.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Dr. Veronica Maz, executive director of SOME - So 
	Others Might Eat - has written a book called the Stick-Carrier. She tells of 
	one such woman:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">June shouted, &quot;I just got out,&quot; as she ran to greet 
	me at the front gate of our soup kitchen. I glanced at her arm and saw the 
	identifying hospital band she was wearing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Like many skid row women, June has experienced 
	intense pain throughout her life but seldom discussed this with others. She 
	had been beaten repeatedly. Seeing her with two black eyes or a swollen , 
	bloody lip was not uncommon. Once her arm was in a cast. On another occasion 
	her leg had been broken in several places.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">June shared a room with several other persons on the 
	first floor of a three-story slum apartment dwelling. The &quot;accident&quot; which 
	prefaced her hospital placement occurred there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Without any preliminary description, June explained, 
	&quot;He took me by my feet and dragged me like a back of potatoes up three 
	flights of steps where he raped me.&quot; She stated that her head had bounced on 
	every step, and her skin was consistently bruised and scraped on the 
	concrete steps. &quot;He dragged me. He dragged me,&quot; with rising inflection she 
	repeated what seemed to her to be the greatest pain of all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In early 1970 I talked with one of the stick 
	carriers. His name was Prince Wright. His story is also told in Dr. Maz' 
	book. He was a big handsome black man, and his muscles and hands showed that 
	he was a man used to hard labor. He hid his shyness behind a gruff manner.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">He told me he had been a stick carrier. &quot;What the 
	deuce is a stick carrier,&quot; I asked him. He explained a stick carrier is the 
	name given to the homeless, destitute, needy persons who sleep in abandoned 
	buildings, cars or trucks, and whose fears are those of being lonely, 
	hungry, hurt, sick, burned alive, robbed, beaten, or frozen to death. They 
	carry a stick to ward off the rats with whom they share their bed and food - 
	often found in trash cans.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">We need a water fountain,' he blurted out. Then he 
	explained:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Where does a homeless, destitute man get a drink of 
	water? He doesn't have a home - no water from there. He doesn't eat in 
	restaurants, and many restaurants refuse requests for water from non 
	customers. Public drinking fountains are practically non existent. Getting a 
	drink of water can be a serious problem.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">To my lasting shame, I refused to give him any 
	money. I was afraid he would go off and get drunk with it. I later learned 
	that the Sisters of the Good Shepherd donated a drinking fountain to SOME.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Because of men like Prince - and women like June - 
	in 1974 we amended the alcoholism act to give incentive grants to States 
	which decriminalize public drunkenness and provide for treatment. More than 
	half the States have now done this, but in many States in this country, 
	Senator, alcoholics are still dying in jails for lack of treatment.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, when we drafted the alcoholism bill in 
	1970, and amended it in 1974, we made no specific mention of women. I make 
	no apology for that. We did not know then that women would not receive full 
	rights as citizens. I now know that little of the funds authorized by this 
	Subcommittee have gone to help women.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So I am pleased to learn that in 1976 my friend, 
	Pete Williams [former Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey], amended 
	the law to provide specific help for these women.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And we paid too little attention to what our 
	children were trying to tell us. When heroin addiction was considered only 
	an inner-city problem, we ignored it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The shameful truth is that only when reports began 
	pouring in about children from white, middle-class suburbs, children of 
	famous Hollywood personalities -- yes, even children of politicians - 
	getting busted on drug charges or dying of drug overdoses, did we begin to 
	react.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When Larry Alan Bear, then commissioner of addiction 
	services for the city of New York, testified before this subcommittee in 
	1970, he read a headline from a New York paper &quot;Dope Kills Eight Youths in 
	Week.&quot; He pointed out that it was not a new headline, but had appeared on 
	November 19, 1962, eight years before.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In 1971 I heard testimony from a Harlem mother. She 
	was testifying about how she could not get the police to close down a 
	hangout in her New York City neighborhood where addicts shot up drugs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Nobody cares about us up there,&quot; she snapped. 
	&quot;Nobody will come and see for themselves what goes on ... and&quot; she glared at 
	me, &quot;I'm sure you don't care either.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><i><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, I was right here in this hearing 
	room when I was chairing the hearing. That mother had gone through hell 
	trying to save her children from addiction and the children in the 
	neighborhood, and was getting shunted around by the authorities.</font></i></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">'I'll come,' I said, 'Well,' she sniffed, 'I'll 
	believe it when I see it.'</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So, a few months later, I turned up in Harlem with a 
	few other nervous Senators. Pete Williams was with me, and Jack Javits [the 
	late Senator Javits of N.Y.] and Dick Schweiker [former Senator Richard 
	Schweiker of Pa.].</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">She was surprised to see us.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">She told me to give $10 to a boy - he was not more 
	than eleven - and see how fast he would be back with heroin. We watched out 
	a window as he went to the hamburger stand on the corner and brought back 
	five bags of heroin. ...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Then she challenged us to follow her to a shooting 
	gallery across the street. We followed her down crumbling cement steps and 
	through a basement doorway. I was frankly scared but she assured me I would 
	be OK as long as I was with her and some other blacks.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">She pulled back a blanket hanging across a 
	clothesline and in the light of two candles we saw six men getting ready to 
	shoot up. They were hooking up, a band around the arm, the needles ready. 
	...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Suddenly a bright white light flooded the basement. 
	We had forgotten all about the TV cameramen who had followed us during the 
	day and had, without warning, turned on their floodlights to film the scene. 
	One of my staff members scrambled in front of me, trying to protect me, and 
	then there was a massive darkness because the light from the television 
	light went out and we scrambled to safety.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">All hell broke loose. I dimly remember my staff man 
	getting in between me and a very angry black man with a knife. We fell over 
	one another trying to get out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When we finally scrambled to safety, I turned to our 
	hostess and said, &quot;I thought you said it would be safe.&quot; Breathing heavily, 
	she replied, &quot;Well, I didn't know you were going to make it into a TV 
	special either.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, you and I cannot possibly know the 
	frustration that woman feels when she detoxifies an addict and then has to 
	send him back into the same conditions that fostered the addiction in the 
	first place: poverty, unemployment, tenements infested with rats, drug 
	pushers on every corner.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, things do not appear to be getting any 
	better. I have heard recent reports that young kids are shifting from the 
	use of drugs alone to mixing them with alcohol.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I hear reports of young people who have to have a 
	drink before they leave for school; who keep bottles stashed in their school 
	lockers or cars; who share their pills at school, dumping them together to 
	form a &quot;fruit salad&quot;; who, in addition, take Valium as casually as we take 
	aspirin for the common cold.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And, Senator, I am not talking about kids in the 
	ghettoes only, I am talking about kids like mine or like yours.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And some parents are so concerned that their kids 
	might get into trouble with the law by smoking a little pot that they 
	actually encourage them to drink</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So I am also happy to learn that Senator Williams 
	amended the law three years ago to include provisions to direct more 
	attention to the young.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, I have been deeply involved with the 
	problems of alcoholism - my own and others - for more than 30 years. If at 
	times I sound like an angry and frustrated man, it is because I am.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I see this great abundant land of ours with 
	resources beyond compare. I see the wonderful achievements of our science 
	and technology; the miracles of modern medicine; the explosive growth of 
	knowledge in numberless areas; the marvelous exploits of American industry 
	and our space programs. But I am sick to my soul by our response to 
	alcoholism. And I am sick to my soul that even when we pass laws to help the 
	alcoholic or the drug addict, we have remained blind to the illness that the 
	alcoholism brings to the spouse or the young children in the family.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, it is not for nothing that the 
	children of alcoholics are at high risk to develop alcoholism or other 
	emotional disorders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So what would I do now if I still sat in your chair? 
	I would ask a lot of questions. I would ask:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why do hospitals still discriminate against 
	alcoholics and addicts despite laws we passed in 1974 to prevent that?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">What is wrong with our society that millions of our 
	citizens, including children as young as six - yes, I said six - turn to 
	alcohol or drugs to deaden their pain?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why are doctors so afraid of the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; 
	that one of them told a member of your staff [Nancy Olson] recently that he 
	would never ask her if she drank too much because she was &quot;well-dressed?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why, when an affluent alcoholic shows up in the 
	office of a high-priced psychiatrist, does she so often wind up also 
	addicted to Valium?</font></p>
	<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3">Mr. Chairman, as I was leaving to come 
	here, I had a call from a physician in my home State, himself an alcoholic, 
	who finally, after years of alcoholism, had sought assistance and had gone 
	into a treatment program. He was coming out of the program and did not know 
	how to continue his professional life because of the illness. He was afraid 
	and called me for counseling 1,500 miles from where he lives. Doctors don’t 
	give this kind of help even to their colleagues. This is almost unbelievable 
	in our time.</font></i></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And I would ask:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why is it that millions of women - at all social 
	levels and of all races - suffer beatings, rapes, and worse from their 
	drunken husbands and yet many times are too ashamed to call the police or 
	tell their ministers?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why, when one does call the police, will the 
	police not respond to a &quot;domestic problem&quot;?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why is it that children who are physically and 
	sexually abused by their own fathers - often with the mother's cooperation - 
	grow into men who do the same to their own children?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why is it a that children of alcoholics often 
	wind up in back wards of mental hospitals?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why is it that a little old woman, carrying all 
	her worldly goods in two shopping bags, was refused her supplemental 
	security income payments until a courageous doctor in New York - herself a 
	recovered alcoholic - was able &quot;to get her back into the system&quot;?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And while were at it, why has that doctor talked to 
	members of this staff over and over again only to be told &quot;there is nothing 
	we can do to help because it's not our jurisdiction?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why is it that we turn our back on old people who 
	are being over-medicated to make life easier for the staffs of nursing 
	homes?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why is it that no one has looked into helping 
	bring alcoholism treatment to our elderly or our physically handicapped?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why has this same woman doctor begged again and 
	again for that to change and still remain unheard?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why do our colleagues on the Appropriations 
	Committee still provide three times the money for dental research as they do 
	for alcoholism?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why are we unwilling to put warning labels on 
	alcohol to warn pregnant women of the danger to their unborn children?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And why did an advertising executive sarcastically 
	accuse a member of your staff [Nancy Olson] of being a &quot;neo-prohibitionist&quot; 
	and a &quot;reincarnation of Carey Nation,&quot; when she quietly suggested that 
	perhaps women were entitled to that information?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why, Senator - in God's name why? Why do we have to 
	continue these ways and why do we have to continue crying out and remain 
	unheard?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, my family often reminds me that I 
	sometimes talk like the drunken truck driver I once was. Today, forgive me 
	if I sound like I am preaching.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But, Senator, I believe with all my heart that one 
	day I will meet my Maker face to face. And on that day I do not believe that 
	He will ask how many important offices I was elected to, nor how many acts 
	of Congress bear my name, or even whether I went to church regularly. I 
	believe that he will ask &quot;What have you done unto the least of these?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, I pray that I will have the right 
	answer</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Usually, I wrote questions for the Chairman to ask each 
witness, but in my hurry to prepare for this hearing, I had forgotten to write 
questions for Senator Riegle to ask Senator Hughes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What should I ask him,&quot; he whispered to me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why don’t you ask him to tell his own story,&quot; I 
replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Senator Riegle was somewhat hesitant. &quot;His alcoholism? I 
don't want to ask him about that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I assured Senator Riegle that Hughes would not mind 
being asked. &quot;He's written an autobiography,&quot; I told him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Riegle asked several other questions first, but then 
said, beating around the bush a bit:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana">There are a lot of people who think that the most 
	important thing right now is to mandate a balanced budget.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Without any regard necessarily to these more 
	substantive and difficult questions, do you know what is the investment 
	value of some of these expenditures that we might make? You have been down 
	this road yourself. I know you have written a book about it, an 
	autobiography, to try to help people understand what it is like to be caught 
	in this trap of alcoholism</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If you would be willing to do it, I think it would 
	be very helpful if you could share some of those thoughts and insights with 
	us. I think it would have great meaning, especially now, in today's climate.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Grinning broadly, Hughes replied: &quot;You mean my own 
alcoholism, Senator?&quot; He had told his own story countless times, at AA meetings, 
in meetings with prisoners, and in his autobiography, <u>The Man From Ida Grove</u>. 
He would tell the story countless times again, until his death in 1996. This is 
how he told it that day:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I was an alcoholic, from the first drink I ever took 
	in my life. I was an alcoholic as a teenager, in high school. I do not know 
	what it is to drink normally ever....</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But alcohol is nothing but trouble for me, and it is 
	a progressive illness for me, and in those days I had no idea that I was 
	sick. It was the tough and manly thing to do, to drink with everyone. The 
	fact that everyone else did not have lapses of memory and blackouts, I did 
	not know. I thought perhaps I was the normal one.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Hell, I was a healthy and powerful man in my younger 
	years. I was able to withstand the brutal treatment that I gave my body.... 
	But my drinking progressed through that, after high school, through the 
	Army, my post-war years, and I finally began to realize that my drinking 
	patterns were destructive. The people that I was hurting the most were those 
	that I loved the most, my wife, my children, those immediately around me.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I promised time and time again that I would quit, 
	and every time I failed, and each time that I failed, my own self esteem 
	went down, and I thought I was worthless in the world. I was working daily, 
	and had as good a job as there was for a working man in the country, and to 
	most on the outside, not really realizing the destruction within me, they 
	were not aware of what was taking place. Even my own aunt said a month ago, 
	&quot;Harold, I did not know you were an alcoholic&quot;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Well, I did not know, either. People knew that I was 
	a drunk, that I was wild, and I would fight, and that I was disruptive. The 
	abuse that I brought on my own wife and family, though I did not beat them, 
	the mental, the verbal abuse, the questions, the wondering whether I was 
	alive or not, they went through for years. It was a rocky road, until one 
	time my wife left me, she took the children and left.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">One day I woke up after a long time not drinking, 
	having drunk again, and I did not know how long I had been drunk. And I was 
	sick, and I was hopeless, and I crawled to the window, to look out to see if 
	the car was there, and did not see it. I did not know whether I killed 
	someone, where my wife or children were, and the only thing that came to me 
	was, what is the use in going on. I do not want to live like this. If I 
	cannot control what I am doing, then I did not want to live. I did not have 
	any faith in God then. Mr. Chairman, I was not at all sure that there was a 
	God. If there was a loving God, I had seen little example of him in what I 
	had seen in life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The savagery in war, man's inhumanity to man, the 
	statement that, who gave a damn to any of us, not anyone. That night I 
	desperately decided that the only way that I could break the cycle of 
	hurting my wife and family was to kill myself. It seemed the logical thing 
	to do.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">My wife was still relatively young, my children were 
	still relatively young, they would be hurt, but they were young. My wife had 
	filed charges of inebriety, to put me in a mental institution. I had hired 
	an attorney and beat that. I know the pain, the lonesomeness, the 
	Godlessness of waking up and saying what the hell is the use, no one cares. 
	I cannot hack it any more.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So I loaded a gun, lay on the bed, and put the 
	barrel in my mouth, and found that I could reach the trigger with the thumb, 
	and then I thought, well, what a mess I will make in the bedroom where we 
	have lived, and had some happy hours, screwed up alcoholic thinking. I do 
	not want to make that mess here. I will go in the bathroom.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So I got up and went in the bathroom, and suddenly 
	something out of my youth came back, and I thought well, maybe if there is a 
	God, I should pray. I know I should not commit suicide. I knew it was wrong. 
	I had been raised in the church but I did not care if I had to pay the price 
	of hell, and eternity. I would have paid to quit hurting my family.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So I knelt on the floor to pray, and I cried out in 
	my agony - because I knew no words of prayer - God help me because I cannot 
	help myself. ... Or let me die, because I do not want to see the sun rise 
	again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Something happened in me. I do not know what it was. 
	But tears started streaming down my face. I got a great sense of peace 
	entering into my body, and seemingly into every cell, and I was on that 
	floor weeping, I do not know how long, an hour or more, I guess. But I 
	realized suddenly that God was somewhere, that he had heard my prayer, and 
	cared about me. I got up from that floor. I did not know much about God. I 
	unloaded the gun, and put it away, and went back to bed and slept peacefully 
	for the first time in weeks, perhaps months</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When I arose in the morning, I called my wife, and 
	asked her if she would come home. She had no reason to. She should have 
	stayed away, by my old drinking record, but she sensed something, 
	apparently, in my voice, and she returned and brought the children back, and 
	started over again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, that was 25 years ago last month. 
	There was not sudden relief from the pain, the suffering and the affliction. 
	There was a long period of growth and loneliness, and desperation. But in 
	the years that intervened, I found the peace that I had never known. I found 
	it because I returned to that which I had strayed away from. The Scripture, 
	the word, my church, my family, and recommitted my life to Jesus Christ in 
	the hope and the belief that wherever he called I would follow.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I believe that he called me into the political 
	arena, I believe that he called me out. I placed my life in his hands, 
	because in my own it was death, it was hell, and it was destruction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Senator Riegle seemed deeply move by Hughes' story 
	and began to respond. But Hughes interrupted him because he wanted to 
	correct something he had said:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman, I want to correct something that I 
	said in my emotion. I made a mistake. That was 27 years go, not 25, and I 
	drank again after that incident, two years later, and got drunk again. But I 
	never drank after that last time.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Now, many times we consider people who are sick with 
	this illness, who have what we call a slip, failures; they are not failures.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If you break the cycle of drinking that a man or 
	woman has had for years, and he is sober for 30 days, or 60 days, or 6 
	months, and he drinks again and then he sobers up again for a year, and then 
	drinks again, and then he sobers up and does not drink for the rest of his 
	life, he's not a failure. I had a friend who was in jail 360-some times, who 
	was considered hopeless by every friend. He has now been sober for over 15 
	years, and a fine engineer. But there is no failure and there is no 
	hopelessness that I know, except the failure of us to forgive, and to try 
	again to have faith that they can make it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Before he left the witness table he asked Riegle if he 
could make just one more comment:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Chairman may I make one last statement briefly, 
	and I know you are busy with these hearings, and I do not want to detain 
	you, but in my lifetime, and in my service in the capacity that you are now 
	in, I never at any time desired to take $1 from the field of mental 
	retardation or the afflicted in any way. I do not want to deny our society 
	of the help they so desperately need, whether it be in dental research, or 
	in any other way, but I believe a society as wealthy and rich as we are in 
	this Nation, cannot afford to leave other segments of illness untreated.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I am asking for additional money. We dress so well, 
	and eat so well, there is no society in history that has ever lived that has 
	had such abundance. How can we ignore the sick in our midst and let them die 
	in the hell that they live in, without giving them health care.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">We must be concerned and care for the least of these 
	in our midst. Not simply because it is cost effective, but because it is 
	right, because it is just, and because it is morally sound</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I do believe that God cares about nations and 
	people, and I believe he does care how we treat one another. To lay down our 
	lives for one another does not mean that we live in abundance while others 
	have little or nothing because of an illness.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">My God, we spend so much in the destructive elements 
	of our world. We coerce so much of our resources into destruction and 
	killing, and the machinery of destruction. I am not privy to the 
	intelligence or the needs in our society, and our international affairs 
	today in these areas, but I know that man has never failed to use those 
	instruments of destruction. But once he builds them, he uses them. But I 
	know that if there is a counter spiritual balance in all of this, that it 
	has to be in the compassionate hearts of men. There is no compassionate 
	bending in the law. It has to be men like yourself, and your colleagues, who 
	care and feel the hurt of others.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Senator, I hope you feel the pain of those that you 
	are serving so that you can serve them well.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Senator Riegle replied that Hughes could &quot;be sure that 
this subcommittee is in this fight to stay. We will call again on your counsel 
and your support, and your prayers, as well, because this is work that we do 
together.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You will have them all. Thank 
you,&quot; Hughes replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Jay Lewis, reporting on the hearing,<font size="2"><sup>*</sup></font> 
said: &quot;When the former Iowa Governor and Senator completed his emotionally 
charged testimony, a round of applause broke out in the hearing room - a rare 
occurrence on Capitol Hill.&quot;</font></p>
