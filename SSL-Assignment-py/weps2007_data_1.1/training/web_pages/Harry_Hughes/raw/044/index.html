                          Z. Whaley's grandfather, served with the 47th &quot;Raiders&quot; 

                          Infantry Regiment in the 9th &quot;Octofoil&quot; Infantry 

                          Division during World War II. Private First Class Hughes 

                          died June 11, 1994 &#151; exactly 50 years to the day 

                          when he stepped ashore Utah Beach in Normandy, France.

                          <br>

                          As my grandfather lay in the Intensive Care Unit of 

                          the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Mountain Home, 

                          Tenn., in June 1994, I remembered the promise I had 

                          made six months earlier on New Year's Day.<br>

                          <br>

                          &quot;Someday, I'm going to write a book about you, 

                          papaw,&quot; I said.<br>

                          <br>

                          &quot;Well I don't know what you'd write about,&quot; 

                          he replied, grinning.<br>

                          <br>

                          Neither did I, exactly, but I wanted to focus on his 

                          combat experiences during World War II. There was just 

                          one problem. I knew nothing of his role in the Second 

                          World War. He was never able to talk about the war. 

                          The mere mention of the words World War II sent him 

                          tumbling into a black hole of horrifying memories, ending 

                          in choking tears.<br>

                          <br>

                          It was more than the frightful sadness in his eyes. 

                          Scars from wounds he suffered in France on Friday, July 

                          14, 1944, marked his upper lip and cheek. Another scar 

                          received in Germany on Sunday, Oct. 1, 1944, branded

                          States Army from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, through 

                          seven of the 9th Infantry Division's eight World War

                          Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Ardennes. 

                          By war's end, Pfc. Hughes had acquired enough points 

                          to return home and did not have to serve in the 9th's 

                          final campaign of military occupation in Central Europe. 

                          Throughout the war, Pfc. Hughes served in F Company, 

                          47th &quot;Raiders&quot; Infantry Regiment, 9th &quot;Octofoil&quot;

                          By the grace and love of God, Hughes lived through one 

                          of the mightiest endeavors this world has ever known 

                          and returned home to participate in history's next big 

                          event &#151; the Baby Boom. Not long after walking the 

                          final trail home in his native North Carolina, Starlin 

                          Harry Hughes married his wartime sweetheart, Mildred 

                          Louise Leonard, and conceived a daughter, Mollie, and

                          40 years. Like many veterans, however, the U.S. government 

                          forgot him and never sent the medals he so gallantly

                          <br>

                          Perhaps I realized the importance of my grandfather's 

                          role in the war when my mother and father held a special 

                          awards ceremony for him in 1988 after contacting the 

                          government and requesting the medals he never received. 

                          Although I was still very young, his streams of tears 

                          and quivering lips and the bold medals and ribbons placed 

                          before him explained that my grandfather had fought 

                          in the bloodiest battles of World War II.<br>

                          <br>

                          &quot;There were a lot more men who sacrificed their

                          I ever will,&quot; Hughes said that day.<br>

                          <br>

                          Hughes was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, Bronze 

                          Star, Purple Heart with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Good Conduct 

                          Medal, Distinguished Unit Badge, American Defense Service

                          At an early age, I became fascinated with two things 

                          &#151; writing and the Second World War. When my grandfather 

                          passed away during the worldwide 50th anniversary celebration 

                          of D-Day, I realized the subject of my first book would 

                          be the 9th Infantry Division in World War II. My motivation 

                          was pushed even further when I discovered there were 

                          no books on the &quot;Old Reliables&quot; currently 

                          in print.<br>

                          <br>

                          While my grandfather never spoke about his role in the 

                          war, I have attempted to track down and interview surviving 

                          veterans of the 9th Infantry Division who would be willing 

                          to share their memories. I have also hoped I would find 

                          someone who remembered my grandfather and could relay 

                          anecdotes about his past.<br>

                                of the Veteran Ninth U.S. Infantry Division, </i>&quot;the 

                                Octofoil dates back to the 15th century when it 

                                was customary for each son to have an individual 

                                mark of distinction.<br>

                                <br>

                                &quot;Perhaps Octo, meaning eight, is a bit confusing 

                                to many when speaking of the Ninth Division. But 

                                in foiling there are eight foils (positions) and 

                                heraldic rules gave the Octofoil to the ninth 

                                son, since it was symbolic of his being surrounded 

                                by eight brothers; which is an explanation of 

                                why this eight-petaled insignia is correct for 

                                the Ninth Regular Army Division.<br>

                                <br>

                                &quot;The design chosen for the Ninth consists 

                                of a red quatrefoil atop a blue quatrefoil with 

                                a white center. The red stands for the artillery, 

                                the blue for the infantry, and the white denotes 

                                the color of numerals found on division flags. 

                                Surrounding the Octofoil is a rim of olive drab 

                                &#151; symbolic of nothing else than the U.S. 

                                Army.&quot;<br>
