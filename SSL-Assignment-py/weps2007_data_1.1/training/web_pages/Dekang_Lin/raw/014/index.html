Jianqiang Wang.  Dekang Lin.  Ian Soboroff.  June 2000.<p> The University of Maryland team participated in four aspects of TREC-8: the ad hoc retrieval task, the main task in the cross-language retrieval (CLIR) track, the question answering track, and the routing task in the filtering track.  The CLIR method was based on Pirkola's method for Dictionary-based Query Translation, using freely available dictionaries.  Broad-coverage parsing and rule-based matching was used for question answering.  Routing was performed using Latent Semantic Indexing in profile space.

Dekang Lin.  Scott Thomas.  June 2000.<p> We describe an approach to large-scale construction of a semantic lexicon for Chinese verbs.  We leverage off of three existing resources--a classification of English verbs called EVCA (English Verbs Classes and Alterations) [Levin, 1993], a Chinese conceptual database called HowNet [Zhendong, 1988c, Zhendong, 1988b] (http://www.how-net.com), and a large machine-readable dictionary called Optilex.  The resulting lexicon is used for determining appropriate word senses in applications such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval.

Bonnie Dorr.  Dekang Lin.  June 2000.<p> This paper describes an approach to large-scale construction of a semantic hierarchy for Chinese verbs.  Leveraging off of an existing Chinese conceptual database called HowNet and a Levin-based English verb classification, we use thematic-role information to create links between Chinese concepts and English classes.  The resulting hierarchy is used for multilingual lexicons in an English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval application.  We demonstrate a structured syntax interface that exploits this large-scale hierarchy and its linkages to WordNet for English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval.

Gina-Anne Levow.  Dekang Lin.  June 2000.<p> This paper addresses the problem of building conceptual resources for multilingual applications.  We describe new techniques for large-scale construction of a semantic hierarchy for Chinese verbs, using thematic-role information to create links between Chinese concepts and English classes.  We then present an approach to compensating for gaps in the existing resources.  The resulting hierarchy is used for a multilingual lexicon for Chinese-English machine translation and cross-language information retrieval applications.
