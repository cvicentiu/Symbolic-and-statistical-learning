<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: A Challenge to the Minimalist Community<br><br><br>  

I see my attempt at a simple metaphor has gone awry. And we seem <br> to be spiraling down into a general discussion of "How can proponents <br> of theory X ever show that it is right/wrong/nonvacuous etc.." Over the <br> years such discussions on the List have not been very fruitful, in my <br> opinion. But I think the Sproat & Lappin challenge raised a much more <br> specific point that risks getting lost. <br> <br> [Sorry for consuming so much bandwidth. I don't foresee the need to <br> say anything further. And let me acknowledge Richard Sprout for <br> some off-list discussion that helped me to clarify some points; he is of <br> course not responsible for anything I say below.] <br> <br> Emily Bender drew the following conclusion from my metaphor: <br> > If I've understood the point of this analogy, it is that building a system <br> > which can take UG and some natural language input and produce a <br> > grammar which can be used to assign structures to (at least the <br> > grammatical) strings in some corpus of language is somehow outside <br> > the original point of what P&P was trying to do. <br> <br> No, that was not the point. The point was that trying to compare the <br> success of two systems (vehicles) at accomplishing a single task <br> (going really fast) is pretty meaningless if you totally ignore all the <br> other things the systems can or cannot do, e.g. support family <br> transportation needs (something that one of the candidates--Corvette, <br> was never designed to do and shows no signs of being able to do). <br> [Of course opinions differ on whether something shows signs of being <br> able to do X--see below.] This is not to say that going fast was not *a* <br> goal in the design of the SUV as well (does anyone ever design a <br> vehicle with the intent of it NOT being able to go fast? perhaps a go- <br> kart), it's simply that other desiderata were considered higher priorities <br> to worry about first (for what many of us consider principled reasons). <br> <br> Just to be crystal clear (and I don't pretend to speak for all P&Pers <br> here): I have no objection with the suggestion that P&P might benefit <br> by trying to build a wide-coverage parser, or implement aspects of the <br> theory in some other way, or pursue proofs as to whether it is capable <br> of (learning to) parse. Others may have strong feelings that this would <br> be unproductive at this stage, I'm agnostic, that's not relevant to my <br> point. <br> <br> My point is that the comparison, which was fairly explicit in S&L's <br> original posting, between P&P and statistical (and other, though they <br> focused on statistical) parsers doesn't make sense. Here's some text <br> from the challenge: <br> <br> > What is particularly notable about the Klein-Manning grammar <br> > induction procedures is that they do what Chomsky and others <br> > have argued is impossible: They induce a grammar using general <br> > statistical methods which have few, if any, built-in assumptions <br> > that are specific to language. <br> <br> To even debate this, we would have to establish a definition <br> for "grammar"; earlier in the paragraph this system is described as <br> inferring a "parser", which, as has been discussed, is crucially not the <br> same thing under usual interpretations of these terms. <br> <br> The important point is the suggestion that some 'alternative(s)' to P&P <br> can supposedly do "what Chomsky and others have argued is <br> impossible ... induce a grammar". Here we have a comparison based <br> on a false premise, it seems to me. What is the evidence that the <br> Klein/Manning algorithms induce a grammar that has the properties <br> Chomsky argued required innate structure to learn? All we've been <br> told about it is that it parses some corpora at some rate less than 80% <br> but is "quickly converging" on that level of accuracy. No one in P&P <br> ever claimed that inducing the ability to parse a representative subset <br> of a corpus of everyday speech to a certain approximation (given POS <br> tags) required innate linguistic machinery. That's not the basis of any <br> poverty-of-the-stimulus argument. We haven't even been told whether <br> this statistical learner systematically distinguishes well-formed from ill- <br> formed novel input, a sine qua non for the sorts of systems Chomsky <br> is talking about. <br> <br> Later on we find the following <br> <br> > If the claims on behalf of P&P approaches are to be taken seriously, <br> > it is an obvious requirement that someone provide a computational <br> > learner that incorporates P&P mechanisms, and uses it to <br> > demonstrate learning of the grammar of a natural language. <br> > <br> > **With this in mind, we offer the following challenge to the <br> > community.** <br> > <br> > We challenge someone to produce, by May of 2008, a working P&P <br> > parser that can be trained in a supervised fashion on a standard <br> > treebank, such as the Penn Treebank, and perform in a range <br> > comparable to state-of-the-art statistical parsers. <br> <br> What are we to make of "with this in mind" as a connective between <br> the upper (and preceding) paragraphs and the lower? The former <br> talks about learning a grammar of a natural language. The latter talks <br> about correctly parsing 90% of examples sampled from some corpus <br> the system was trained on. Accomplishing the very narrow parsing <br> task in S&L's challenge hardly tells us anything about whether some <br> system is or is not able to learn a natural language grammar, so if our <br> goal is really studying how humans acquire grammars, the challenge <br> is virtually irrelevant to that goal. <br> <br> I suppose that someone of the S&L persuasion might sum up the <br> argument thus [I'm speaking purely hypothetically, following the lead of <br> S&L in suggesting what "the other side" might say:] <br> <br> "How do humans learn and parse human language? Chomsky says <br> this ability relies on innate language-specific knowledge. But *we* <br> have statistical systems that we claim can achieve part of what <br> humans do, without any innate language-specific knowledge. We've <br> solved/are on the verge of solving (part of) the problem you said only <br> your approach could solve, so you'd better convince us that at the <br> very least you can indeed solve that problem too. Then we'll have two <br> promising theories that we can try out on other parts of the bigger <br> problem." <br> <br> To show what's wrong with this, despite some trepidation I cannot <br> resist one final vehicular analogy. <br> <br> "What makes a car work in its primary function (as a self-propelled <br> device)? You claim that an engine is absolutely crucial. Now we <br> observe that one of the properties that cars have is that if you push <br> them, they will roll for a while (e.g. when the battery is dead). I've built <br> a contraption (a little red wagon, say) that will roll for a while if you <br> push it. Therefore, your claim that an engine is necessary to make a <br> car work is now seriously in jeopardy, because my little red wagon <br> doesn't have an engine, and look, it rolls almost as well as a fast car, <br> and better than an SUV. We should explore little red wagons as <br> alternatives to cars." <br> <br> To avoid misinterpretation: <br> <br> engine = innate knowledge <br> roll on wheels = (learn to) approximately parse a corpus after training <br> on it <br> self-propulsion = acquiring human language <br> car = human: can do lots of things, of which rolling after a push is one, <br> and obviously not totally unrelated to its critical function of self- <br> propulsion, but <br> not one of the more difficult things to get it to do either <br> SUV = current-day P&P model, according to S&L, who might say it <br> doesn't <br> roll at all <br> <br> Carson <br> <br> <br> Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics <br> Discipline of Linguistics <br> Linguistic Theories

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: A Challenge to the Minimalist Community<br><br><br> 

	<br> I would like to add two points to the current discussion. <br> <br> First, the challenge probably has been met - and many years ago. <br> Broad coverage parsers based on Government Binding / Minimalism <br> DO exist. The earliest commercial application I am aware of was Bob <br> Kuhns' GB parser that was used to summarize newswire stories in the <br> 1980s, published at the COLING conference in 1990. A more glaring <br> omission is Dekang Lin's Principles & Parameters based parsers - <br> unambiguously dubbed PRINCIPAR and MINIPAR respectively - which <br> have been used in a variety of applications, and have figured <br> prominently in computational linguistics. For instance, for the task of <br> pronoun antecedent resolution, Lin's P&P-based system compared <br> favorably against the much larger and expensive programs at <br> DARPA's 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC) in 1995. <br> One of the reasons for its success was the implementation of - God <br> forbid - the binding theory, in addition to other discourse constraints <br> on pronoun resolution. <br> <br> MINIPAR is a parsing system based on the Minimalist formalism, and <br> has been around for at least 8 years: I evaluated - and recommended - <br> the parser for a major computer company in the summer of 1997. <br> According to Lin's website, <br> <A HREF="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/minipar.htm">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/minipar.htm</A>, ''MINIPAR is a broad- <br> coverage parser for the English language. An evaluation with the <br> SUSANNE corpus shows that MINIPAR achieves about 88% precision <br> and 80% recall with respect to dependency relationships. MINIPAR is <br> very efficient, on a Pentium II 300 with 128MB memory, it parses about <br> 300 words per second.'' You can even download a copy. I suspect <br> that no reward is necessary: Dekang Lin is currently at Google, Inc. <br> <br> My second point has to with the success of statistical parsing. In my <br> experience, most linguists don't give a damn about parsing, or <br> computers, for that matter: they are not paid to develop technologies <br> that may one day interest Microsoft. Yet I invite those who are in the <br> business of (statistical) parsing to reflect on their success. On my <br> view, the improvement in parsing quality over the past decade or so <br> has less to do with breakthroughs in machine learning, but rather with <br> the enrichment in the representation of syntactic structures over which <br> statistical induction can take place. The early 1990s parsers using <br> relatively unconstrained stochastic grammars were disastrous <br> (Charniak 1993). By the mid 90s, notions like head and lexical <br> selection, both of which are tried and true ideas in linguistics, had <br> been incorporated in statistical parsers (de Marcken 1996, Collins <br> 1997). The recent, and remarkable, work of Klein and Manning (2002) <br> takes this a step further. So far as I can tell, in the induction of a <br> grammatical constituent, Klein & Manning's model not only keeps track <br> of the constituent itself, but also its aunts and sibling(s) in the tree <br> structure. These additional structures is what they refer to <br> as ''context''; those with a more traditional linguistics training may <br> recall ''specifier'', ''complement'', ''c-command'', and ''government''. <br> <br> If this interpretation is correct, then the rapid progress in statistical <br> parsing offers converging evidence that the principles and constraints <br> linguists have discovered are right on the mark, and if one wishes, can <br> be put into use for practical purposes. (And perhaps linguists deserve <br> a share of the far larger pot of research funds available to natural <br> language engineers.) This, then, would seem to be a time to rejoice <br> and play together, rather than driving a wedge of ''challenge'' between <br> the two communities. <br> <br> Charles Yang <br> Yale University <br> <br> References <br> <br> Charniak, E. 1993.

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: A Challenge to the Minimalist Community<br><br><br> 

	<br> Much of the recent discussion about Minimalism reminds me of a <br> prevalent trend witnessed many times before on the LINGUIST list in <br> the course of other similar discussions. As linguists we seem to be far <br> too much driven by some supposedly significant methodological and <br> computational imperatives, or even by mere notational determinants. <br> My recollection of most past debates of this nature is that eventually <br> they often deteriorate into sterile argumentation. While issues bearing <br> on methodology, computational tractability, and so forth, should <br> remain important, surely none of them can be considered to constitute <br> a decisive testing ground for what is or isn't a good theory. Usually <br> we come to know that a theory is good only after the fact, that is, after <br> it has been formulated and found to be successful (and, therefore, <br> true). As John Framptom and others have implied in some of the <br> recent postings, a good parser is primarily just that: a good parser. <br> How exactly to anticipate the success (or otherwise) of a linguistic <br> theory even before it has been fleshed out is a question that's not only <br> unfair but misguided: if we already knew what a good theory in a <br> relatively unexplored domain was supposed to look like, we wouldn't <br> be in the business of striving for one in the first place! <br> <br> In the end, the generative paradigm may indeed turn out to be wrong, <br> but over the decades it has provided most of the leading ideas in our <br> field, and has in addition helped us dig up a lot of new data. To the <br> extent that this is any indication of eventual success, I believe it <br> wouldn't be wise to let its fate be judged by any programming sleights <br> of hand. <br> <br> Anjum Saleemi <br> National Chi Nan University <br> Taiwan <br> <br> <br> Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics <br> Discipline of Linguistics <br> Linguistic Theories <br>
