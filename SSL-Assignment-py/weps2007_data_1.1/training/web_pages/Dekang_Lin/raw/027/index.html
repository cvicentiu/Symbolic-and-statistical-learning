The Association for Computational Linguistics invites the submission
of papers for its 40th Annual Meeting hosted jointly with the North
American Chapter of the ACL. Papers are invited on substantial,
original, and unpublished research on all aspects of computational
linguistics, including, but not limited to: pragmatics, discourse,
semantics, syntax and the lexicon; phonetics, phonology and
morphology; interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language;
language-oriented information retrieval, question answering,
summarization and information extraction; language-oriented machine
learning; corpus-based language modeling; multi-lingual processing,
machine translation and translation aids; natural language interfaces
and dialogue systems; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with
other modalities in multi-media systems; message and narrative
understanding systems; tools and resources; and evaluation of systems.


Requirements
- ----------

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation results should be included. A paper accepted for
presentation at the ACL Meeting cannot be presented or have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other conferences or
workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that
contain significant overlap with previously published work. For
details see:
 <A HREF="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/double-submission-policy.html">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/double-submission-policy.html</A>


Reviewing
- -------

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed
by an international Conference Program Committee consisting of Area
Chairs, each of whom will have the assistance of a set of Program
Committee members. Final decisions on the technical program will be
made by the Conference Program Committee. Each submission will be
reviewed by at least three reviewers.


Submission Format
- ---------------

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. They are available at
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/acl02/style/">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/acl02/style/</A> 
A description of the format will also be available in case you are
unable to use these style files directly. As reviewing will be
blind. The paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, e.g., &quot;We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&quot;, should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as &quot;Smith previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...&quot;.

Papers that do not conform to the requirements above are subject to be
rejected without review.

Submission Procedure
- ------------------

1) Paper registration: You must submit a notification of submission
by filling out the form at 
	 <A HREF="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/acl02/submit.htm">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/acl02/submit.htm</A>
The authors should fill in the title of the paper, the authors' names,
affiliations, and email addresses, one or two general topic areas, up
to 5 keywords specifying the subject area, and a short summary (up to
200 words). The authors should also specify whether the paper is
under consideration for other conferences or workshops, and if so,
which ones.

Each submission will be assigned an identification number. Please use
it on all correspondence with the program committee.

2) Paper submission: All papers must be submitted electronically at
the same web address. The first page of your paper must include the
identification number obtained from paper registration. The paper must
be submitted no later than 12 noon Mountain Time (7PM GMT) on
Feb. 1 2002. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.
Papers must be in PDF format. The submission web page includes
information about converting different types of documents to PDF. The
program committee will make every attempt to print out your paper
successfully, but cannot take responsibility if they do not. Authors
are strongly encouraged to submit papers 48 hours before the
submission deadline so that unprinting formats can be detected and
corrected by the submission deadline. If for some reason an author is
not able to submit electronically, or if we have discovered in advance
that there is a problem with the PDF file, authors should contact
Dekang Lin (lindek<img src='address-marker.gif' width='20' height='20' align='absbottom'>cs.ualberta.ca) concerning hard-copy submission.

MENTORING SERVICE: 

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from
regions of the world where English is not the language of scientific
exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to read the
scientific literature in English, have little or no experience in
writing papers in English for conferences such as the ACL
meetings. They may also have some trouble with the style of the
presentation of the material that is expected for ACL.

The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential mentors
will be identified by Aravind Joshi, who has agreed to organize this
service for ACL-02. An author who would like to take advantage of this
service must send a draft of his/her paper to

 Aravind K. Joshi
 Room 555 Moore
 Department of Computer and Information Science
 200 South 33rd Street
 University of Pennsylvania
 Philadelphia, PA
 USA
 FAX: +1 215 898 0587 

The author must send ONE copy of the paper (HARD COPY by regular mail
or by FAX) by no later than December 14th, 2001. The author should try
to make the draft as complete as possible in order to get the best
advice. An appropriate mentor will be assigned to your paper and the
mentor will get back to the author at least two weeks before the
deadline for the submission to ACL-02 program committee (February 1,
2002).

Please note that this service is for the benefit of the authors as
described above. It is not a general mentoring service for authors to
improve their papers.

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send
a message to Aravind Joshi (joshi<img src='address-marker.gif' width='20' height='20' align='absbottom'>linc.cis.upenn.edu)</PRE>
