The firsttype of economy is the simplicity of grammar design. A grammar shouldinvolve minimal set of primitive relationships, operations andtheory internal concepts. The second type of economy is related tocomputational complexity.  An otherwise good sentence structure may beconsidered illicit because of the existence of a comparable structurethat requires less effort to generate.<DD>In this talk, I will present a principle-based parser, called Minipar,that relies on a small set of computational mechanisms and grammaticalprinciples.  While there are usually two basic operations in mostminimalist theories: MERGE and MOVE, Minipar allows only MERGE andFeature Percolation/Checking during MERGE. The functionalities of MOVEare attained through the binding relationship between a displacedelement and its trace. The advantage of this approach is that parsercomputation becomes monotonic as a result. Objects constructed byMERGE are never changed in any way. I will argue that monotonicity isextremely important from computational complexity point of view.<DD>After describing the computational machinery employed in Minipar, Iwill present 6 grammatical principles implemented in Minipar anddemonstrate how they account for a wide range of phenomena in English,such as passive voice, raising, super-raising, exceptional casemarking, ditransitive verbs, displacement of expletives, wh-movement,that-trace effect, wh-island and crossover. I will show that each oneof the principles is required in the explanations of several differentgrammatical phenomena.<P><HR><P>For the colloquium series schedule, see the <AHREF="http://www.ling.umd.edu/Ling/home.html">Linguistics department</A> web page athttp://www.umd.edu/Ling/.
