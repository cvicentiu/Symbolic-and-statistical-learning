  The organizers of the Second Meeting of the North American Chapter
  of the ACL invite proposals for the Tutorial Program for NAACL-2001,
  to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, 2-7 June 2001.  The
  tutorials will be held on June 2nd.

<P>  Each tutorial should be well-focused so that its core content can be
  covered in a three hour tutorial slot (plus a 30 minute break). In
  exceptional cases, 6-hour tutorial slots are possible as well.

<P>  There will be space and time for between four and six three-hour
  tutorials.

<h3>SUBMISSION DETAILS</h3>

<UL>
<LI> A title and brief (less than 500 words) content description of the
    tutorial topic.

<LI> The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
    the tutorial speakers, with one-paragraph statement of the
    speaker's(s') research interests and areas of expertise.

    etc.)
</UL>
  Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII
  (iso8859-1) text as soon as possible, but no later than December 20,
  2000.

<P>  Please E-mail proposals to 
<A HREF="mailto:lindek@cs.ualberta.ca?Subject=NAACL 2001 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL">
lindek@cs.ualberta.ca</A>, with the subject
  line: "NAACL 2001 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

<P>  Please Note: Proposals will not be accepted by regular mail or fax.


<h3>PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS</h3>

  Accepted tutorial speakers must provide descriptions of their
  tutorials for inclusion in the Conference Registration material by
  February 14, 2001. The description must be provided in three formats:
  a latex version that fits onto 1/2 page; an ASCII (iso8859-1) version
  that can be included with the email announcement; an HTML version that
  can be included on the Conference home page.

  Tutorial speakers will provide tutorial materials, at least containing
  copies of the overhead sheets used, by April 25, 2001.

<h3>FINANCES</h3>

  The current NAACL policy is that tutorials are reimbursed at the
  following rate: $500 per session plus $25 per registrant in the
  range 21-50 plus $15 per registrant in excess of 50.  Note that this
  is per tutorial, not per presenter: multiple presenters will split the
  proceeds, the default assumption being an even split. The NAACL does
  not usually cover travel expenses except where the presenter(s) are
  not independently attending the conference and getting travel
  reimbursed.
