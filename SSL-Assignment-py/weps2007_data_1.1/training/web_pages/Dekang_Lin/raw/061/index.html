<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This web page contains pointers to various resources and
sites of interest for those interested in building information extraction
systems, and in understanding current research and the state of the art.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We have made an effort to include what information we could
find on the World Wide Web, but we are making no claims that this collection
is complete. We know of some interesting projects for which we were unable
to find web sites. Absence from this list is not to be construed as a negative
evaluation of the system or the research behind it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Probably the most important collections of papers for the field 
  of information extraction are the proceedings of the Message Understanding Conferences 
  (MUC). These conferences are actually DARPA-sponsored evaluations in which participants 
  evaluated their systems in blind tests on a common set of data. The conferences 
  were MUC-3 (1991), MUC-4 (1992), MUC-5(1993), and MUC-6 (1995). , and MUC-7 
  (to be published). The proceedings are available from <A HREF="http://www.mkp.com/">Morgan

    This is a lightweight information extraction system for PowerPC Macintosh 
    computers, written by yours truely just for the fun of it. More than a toy, 
    it's based on the TIPSTER architecture, and uses the TIPSTER Common Pattern 
    Specification Language. It's available for free, and is particularly well 
    suited to name-recognition applications.

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The University of Massachusetts at Amherst, led by Wendy 
      Lehnert, developed very effective information extraction systems for the 
      MUC-4 and MUC-5 evaluations. Recent research has focused on issues involving 
      automatic learning of extraction rules from annotated corpora.<BR>

      MUC-6. They are described here.<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Consortium for Lexical Research was operated by the 
          Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University, until 
          December 1, 1995, when it ceased operation due to lack of funding support. 
          The Consortium maintained a collection of lexical resources that were 
          available to members. Now that the center no longer exists, CRL has 
          made the files of CLR available free of charge to all interested parties. 
          Although the resources are no longer maintained and updated, and hence 
          can become out of date, they are still a very valuable source of information 
          for information extraction system building. Among other resources the

        <P><FONT SIZE=+1>A longstanding research project at Princeton University 
          led by George Miller has developed a system that categorizes a very 
          large number of English words according to their senses, allowing searches

        <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Davy Temperly and Dan Sleator of Carnegie Mellon University 
          have developed a dependency-grammar formalism and associated parser 
          that is quite comprehensive and very robust. They have measured its 
          performance on Wall Street Journal texts as comparable to the best parsers. 
          It is fast and robust enough that it may be useful for information extraction 
          system development, and it is available for free from their web page.<BR>
