<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: A Challenge to the Minimalist Community<br><br><br>  

<pre>Again we wish to thank the many people who have responded to our <br>challenge. It seems to us that most of the recent postings on both <br>sides of the debate have restated points made in earlier rounds, and <br>we will not take these up again. Readers can now come to their own <br>conclusions concerning the issues that have been raised in this <br>discussion. However, we do feel compelled to respond to several of <br>the assertions that Charles Yang makes in his posting. <br> <br>1. First, Yang claims: <br> <br> "[T]he challenge probably has been met - and many years ago. <br> Broad coverage parsers based on Government Binding / Minimalism <br> DO exist. The earliest commercial application I am aware of was Bob <br> Kuhns' GB parser that was used to summarize newswire stories in <br> the 1980s, published at the COLING conference in 1990. A more <br> glaring omission is Dekang Lin's Principles & Parameters based <br> parsers - unambiguously dubbed PRINCIPAR and MINIPAR <br> respectively - which have been used in a variety of applications, and <br> have figured prominently in computational linguistics." <br> <br>Unfortunately this claim seriously misrepresents the facts at two levels. <br> <br>Most importantly, our challenge was to produce a TRAINABLE broad- <br>coverage parser based on Minimalist Program/P&P principles that <br>could perform at the same level as statistical parsers on a standard <br>test set. Neither Kuhns' nor Lin's systems include a learning <br>component. Therefore, for that reason alone they do not meet the <br>challenge as we had stated it. <br> <br>But there would still seem to be an issue here since we had claimed in <br>our original posting: <br> <br> "While there have been P&P-based parsers (Fong 1991, 2005), and <br> even attempts to build parsers that learn P&P-style grammars <br> (Berwick, 1982), all of these systems have one thing in common: they <br> are small-scale implementations that make no attempt at broad <br> linguistic coverage. They are not even up to the task of parsing <br> arbitrary Dr. Seuss books, let alone the ''Wall Street Journal''." <br> <br>Yang's claim above would thus seem to be most relevant to this <br>portion of what we said. But actually the facts are far from clear. <br>Kuhns' parser, (Robert Kuhn, "A PARALOG Implementation of <br>Government Binding Theory", COLING 1990) describes a parser that <br>does encode certain GB constraints. But, as we already noted, it <br>does not perform grammar induction from a corpus nor, crucially, is <br>any evaluation of the parser against test data offered in the paper. <br> <br>Lin's PRINCIPAR system (Dekang Lin, "PRINCIPAR--An Efficient, <br>Broad Coverage, Principle-based Parser", COLING 1994) does <br>incorporate a number of GB conditions, but again there is no reported <br>evaluation of the parser on a corpus, though Lin does report on <br>efficiency issues, and cites some sentences that the system gets <br>correct. <br> <br>Lin's later system, MINIPAR (Dekang Lin, "Dependency-based <br>Evaluation of MINIPAR", Workshop on the Evaluation of Parsing <br>Systems, Grenada, Spain, 1998) was evaluated on a test set of 7,103 <br>sentences from the SUSANNE corpus (a subset of the Brown corpus). <br>According to these results the parser achieves an average of <br>(approximately) 88% recall and 78% precision on head-dependency <br>relations across various categories of text. According to Lin, MINIPAR <br>is a descendant of PRINCIPAR that has "adopted some of the ideas in <br>the Minimalist Program such as bare phrase structure and economy <br>principles." But the actual mechanisms of MINIPAR are not described <br>in the cited paper so it is unclear to what extent it is in fact a P&P or <br>MP parser in any meaningful sense. <br> <br>As a matter of fact, the first author evaluated MINIPAR some years <br>ago for another project, and still has a copy of the system. The basic <br>functionality of the parser is only available as a compiled library so it is <br>not possible to examine those portions. However, many portions of the <br>system are viewable as plain text, including various lexicons and rules. <br>An examination of the plain text portions reveals very little if anything <br>that is specifically P&P or MP in nature, with the vast majority of the <br>information being information that would be needed in any parser, <br>such as what categories words belong to or what types of arguments <br>they expect; there are also some rather specific functions such as <br>THERE-INSERTION and IT-INSERTION suggesting that not all <br>aspects of the system's behavior are derived from deep principles as <br>might be expected from a P&P/MP parser. Also, the parameter <br>settings that seem to be there also seem to be hard wired for English. <br> <br>Both of the present authors have also written parsing systems that <br>incorporate ideas that are found in the P&P or MP literature (though <br>found in other syntactic theories too). However we would not label our <br>systems as P&P since their inner mechanics do not derive from <br>manipulations of parameter settings in the way that, say, Fong's <br>system clearly does. <br> <br>However, we will grant Yang that Kuhns' and Lin's work should at <br>least have received mention in our original posting. No matter: what is <br>clear is that our challenge is in no sense met by these two systems for <br>the simple reason that neither of them learns from data. <br> <br>2. Yang goes on to say: <br> <br> "In my experience, most linguists don't give a damn about parsing, <br> or computers, for that matter: they are not paid to develop <br> technologies that may one day interest Microsoft." <br> <br>We note that all of the work on machine learning (ML) that we cite in <br>our challenge was done by university researchers who are interested <br>in the scientific questions involved in determining the capacities and <br>limitations of different types of computational learning models. It is <br>entirely reasonable to disagree with our challenge or the view of <br>grammar acquisition that we have suggested as a possible alternative <br>to the P&P model on scientific grounds. We may well be wrong, and <br>vigorous debate of the relevant issues is to be welcomed. However it <br>is at best a distraction to impute professional motives to computational <br>linguists with whom one disagrees. Even if it were true that most NLP <br>researchers were working in industry, which, as far we know, is not <br>the case, this fact is not at all relevant to the question under <br>discussion. We continue to take this question to be whether it is <br>possible to demonstrate the computational viability of the P&P model <br>by actually constructing a P&P grammar induction system that equals <br>the performance of ML systems. <br> <br>3. Yang then goes on to state: <br> <br> "On my view, the improvement in parsing quality over the past <br> decade or so has less to do with breakthroughs in machine learning, <br> but rather with the enrichment in the representation of syntactic <br> structures over which statistical induction can take place. The early <br> 1990s parsers using relatively unconstrained stochastic grammars <br> were disastrous (Charniak 1993). By the mid 90s, notions like head <br> and lexical selection, both of which are tried and true ideas in <br> linguistics, had been incorporated in statistical parsers (de <br> Marcken 1996, Collins 1997). The recent, and remarkable, work of <br> Klein and Manning (2002) takes this a step further. So far as I can <br> tell, in the induction of a grammatical constituent, Klein & Manning's <br> model not only keeps track of the constituent itself, but also its <br> aunts and sibling(s) in the tree structure. These additional structures <br> is what they refer to as ''context''; those with a more traditional <br> linguistics training may recall ''specifier'', ''complement'', ''c- <br> command'', and ''government''." <br> <br>Yang seems to be suggesting that the use of increasingly complex <br>representations in training data is the major factor in the success of <br>ML methods. This may be partly true in the case of supervised <br>learning from treebank corpora, although this assumption would not <br>explain the rapid improvement of supervised ML methods on the same <br>Wall Street Journal annotated texts over the past ten years. <br> <br>However, Yang's comment on Klein and Manning's work seems to <br>involve a serious misunderstanding of unsupervised learning in <br>general and their systems in particular. Klein and Manning achieve <br>binary branching constituent structure and head dependency <br>structure recognition on the basis of Penn treebank input annotated <br>only with part of speech information. None of the parse structure in <br>these corpora or the syntactic relations that Yang mentions are part of <br>the input to their learning algorithms. Moreover, in several of their <br>experiments the POS tagging is itself contributed by a previous cycle <br>of unsupervised learning. <br> <br>Following on the previously quoted passage, Yang states: <br> <br> If this interpretation is correct, then the rapid progress in statistical <br> parsing offers converging evidence that the principles and <br> constraints linguists have discovered are right on the mark, and if <br> one wishes, can be put into use for practical purposes. <br> <br>This comment represents an interesting shift of ground. It is true that <br>linguistic insights such as "head" and "lexical selection" have made it <br>into the statistical parsing literature. And these are indeed insights that <br>have been productively used in theoretical linguistics. But since when <br>were these concepts the unique provenance of P&P approaches to <br>syntax? On the contrary, notions like "head", "lexical selection", and <br>perhaps X-bar theory, seem to be among the few things that <br>theoretical syntacticians of any persuasion can all agree on. So <br>contrary to Yang's implication, the fact that statistical parsing work has <br>picked up on these linguistic ideas offers no solace to P&P/MP <br>grammarians. <br> <br>4. Finally, Yang ends with the following plea: <br> <br> "This, then, would seem to be a time to rejoice and play together, <br> rather than driving a wedge of ''challenge'' between the two <br> communities." <br> <br>Needless to say, we have no objection to the notion that we should all <br>play together. Unfortunately though, a great many responses to our <br>challenge from the P&P/MP community have involved various attempts <br>to argue that our challenge is irrelevant to the goals of that version of <br>theoretical syntax. This does not suggest to us that there is any <br>widespread desire to play together. If our challenge was a "wedge" <br>then it must have fallen to the ground already, since the gap we drove <br>it into was already far too large. <br> <br>Richard Sproat <br>Shalom Lappin</pre> <br><br><br>
