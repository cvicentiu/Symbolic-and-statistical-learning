    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Dear Sir, </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">I find a picture of my fathers <br>
    bearing a similar title to the <br>
    title which you mention, thus <br>
    described in my published “Life <br>
    of Wm Collins RA” (Vol II. Appendix <br>
    Page 347). <br>
    “Date of Exhibition 1831. Picture: – A Nutting Party. Exhibited at The 
    British Institution. <br>
    Purchased by The Revd R.A. Thorpe. <br>
    Price paid 150 Guineas.”<br>

    If this is the picture now in <br>
    your possession, it will probably <br>
    sell by auction for a far larger <br>
    price than the price originally given for it. <br>
    Messrs Christie and Manson of <br>
    London (King Street St James’s) are <br>
    the best auctioneers for the <br>
    purpose, if you decide to sell <br>
    the picture this way. You <br>
    have only to communicate with </font></p>

    Agnew of Manchester are <br>
    well known as great buyers <br>
    of modern pictures. In <br>
    your place, however, <u>I</u> should <br>
    sell the picture by auction – <br>
    putting a reserved price on <br>
    it which Messrs Christie and <br>
    Manson would be able to suggest <br>

    <td width="50%">WC writes in <i>Memoirs </i>:
    <p>‘Of the pictures at the British Institution, the largest was “The Nutting 
    Party,” painted for the Rev. R. A. Thorpe; a rustic inland scene, with a 
    fine group of children in the foreground’ (<i>Memoirs</i> I 344). </p>
    <p>The painting was given to the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://collage.cityoflondon.gov.uk/">Guildhall Art Gallery</a>, 
    London by Charles Gassiot in 1902 and it is sometimes exhibited there. Its 
    label says &quot;Collecting nuts in season was an important social activity. 
    Despite the peaceful scene in this picture it was painted during a turbulent 
    year of agitation against agricultural mechanisation and low pay for farm 
    labourers.&quot; The picture still retains its original varnish and is more or 
    less untouched by restorers. </p>
    <p>The image on the Guildhall website is deliberately degraded with a large 
    'C' across the centre..</td>

<p>The picture is recorded in George Redford, Art Sales (2 vols, London, 1888), 
as sold by W. Dickson at Christie’s in 1870 for 900 guineas (£945), buyer Agnew. 
However, a note by Dickson found with the letter says: ‘The Nutting Party – 
painted for The Revd R. A. Thorpe for 150 gns &amp; put up at Christies for sale &amp; 
for which 900 guineas was bid, but it was bought in. – This I had the sale of – 
Mr. Thorpe was my Brother in Law – He gave it to his aunt Miss Jane Thorpe of 
Durham &amp; it came under my control as her Administrator.’<br>
