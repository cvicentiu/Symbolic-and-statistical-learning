	<EM>This speech presented by William Dickson in 1865



    describes an approach to Reconstruction that involves giving both African Americans and



    former Confederates the vote. What arguments does Dickson put forth to support this



    approach? What arguments against his approach does he anticipate? How well does he counter

	The fact is, and we might as well look it squarely in the face, with a few



    unimportant exceptions, the Southern whites yield sullenly and reluctantly to the decision



    of the sword. They are conquered, not converted.

    

    <P>

    

    Do not mistake me; I ask them of no unmanly self-abasement. I would not



    have them otherwise than proud of the prowess they have exhibited in the contest. But



    before I would give them a voice in the affairs of the nation, a vote to control your and



    my concerns, I would have a guaranty that this voice and this vote would be directed to



    the common good, that these would not be merely new and more dangerous weapons in their



    hands, to carry on the war against the Union. . . .

    

    <P>

    

    At the commencement of this war, it was a common declaration of those who



    were in sympathy with the rebels, that the rebellion could not be put down; that history



    did not furnish an example of eight or ten millions of people determined on independence



    being conquered. These opinions were generally held by the rulers of Europe. But there was



    one important element left out of the calculation, namely, nearly one half of the



    population of the rebel States, were the determined enemies of the rebellion, and this



    half constituted the laboring class . This half neutralized, in the long run, the other



    half. . . .

    

    <P>

    

    . . . I would have it continue this good work. I would so reconstruct the



    Southern States, that while I gave to the disloyal half their full equality before the



    law, I would paralyze their disloyal purposes by giving a like equality to the loyal half.



    What wrong is there is this? I give to the men who, for four years have been to destroy



    the nation full rights--the same which you and I have. The only condition imposed, is,



    that their loyal follow citizens shall have the problem of reconstructions is full harmony



    with the representative principle and all our institutions. It will in a brief time remove



    pro-consular governments, and restore the normal condition of all the States. The country



    can then rest satisfied that a full guaranty against any efforts of the rebels to do



    injury, under a restored government. This solution introduces no new element, no new



    principle into our government. It is but the complete application of the principles of our



    fathers, set forth in the declaration of independence.

    

    <P>

    

    The exception which they reluctantly permitted against the negro is



    removed. It gives representation to those whom we subject to drafts an taxes It rests upon



    the golden rule of right. It is but doing unto others what we would that they should do



    unto us.

    

    <P>

    

    Why shall it not be adopted? And here the false theory of State rights is



    again thrust forward, by certain parties, in the precise same sense, and for the same



    purpose with which it was introduced at the beginning of the warm, to support the



    proposition that the government had no right to defend against rebellion. Then the



    Government had no power to resist those who sought its life! now these being captured, it



    has no power to require them to give bonds to keep the peace! Here again the true relation



    of things is perverted. Grant indeed, not Lee, has surrendered; the Union forces, not the



    rebels, have been disarmed.

    

    <P>

    

    It is no part of my present purpose to elaborate the argument,



    establishing the power of the government to impose conditions, looking to the public



    safety, upon the rebels. If it has no power to do this, it had no power to make war. The



    one follows from the other. The rebels well knew, when they appealed to the tribunal of



    the sword, what the judgment must be, if the decision should be adverse to them. By the



    universal laws of war, the conquering power may impose such conditions of settlement,



    looking to its own safety and welfare, as it pleases; only these must not be in violation



    of the laws of humanity. This principle clearly gives the Government power to adopt the



    plan of reconstruction proposed. . . .

    

    <P>

    

    It is said, however, that the blacks could only vote at the point of the



    bayonet, that the Southern whites would not otherwise permit them. Then the rebellion is



    not subdued; we have a truce, not lasting peace. If this is the case, the sooner we know



    it the better; at least it were better to know it before we disband our armies.

    

    <P>

    

    But I do not believe this; doubtless the masters are averse to the negroes



    voting; not any more however, than they were to their freedom. They profess to acquiesce



    in the latter, they will also in the former. The rebels are not now in a condition to



    fight the United States and the freedmen at the polls. And in a short time the soldiers of



    the Government can be safely removed. Every day the negro will acquire knowledge and



    power, all of which will be respected at the polls. This thing of fighting is an easy



    matter to the armed dominant party over his unarmed subordinate. But between equals, it is



    a very different affair....In those rebel States in which the negroes are the more



    numerous, the whites will be slow to provoke a contest. They will, everywhere, rather



    endeavor in a different way to control the negro votes; they will seek them by kindness.



    Such is human nature. I expect to see the day when a Southern Democrat, will be seen



    &quot;carrying&quot; arm in arm to the polls, two negro voters. For the white race has no



    monopoly of worthless men. They belong to all races.

    

    <P>

    

    Again, it is objected, that the Southern negro is ignorant and unfit to



    vote. He seems to have been intelligent enough to be loyal, which was more than his master



    was. But I do not deny the ignorance; their condition of slavery forbids that it could be



    otherwise. Yet they share this ignorance in common with the poor whites; and I would be



    willing to apply to both these classes an educational test. Still I would not recommend



    this. Freedom is the school in which freemen are to be taught, and the ballot-box is a



    wonderful educator. . . .

    

    <P>

    

    . . . As the force of the negro must enter into the formation of our



    civilization, it is to the interest of the white man not less than of the black man, that



    this force should be for good. It cannot be, however, unless the negro is moral,



    intelligent and industrious. How can we give him these desirable characteristics? We have



    only to consider the conditions under which white men have become moral, intelligent, and



    industrious, and apply these to the black man.

    

    <P>

    

    Our proposition thus becomes very simple; we must educate him and place



    before him the rewards of good conduct and the penalties of bad conduct. We must give him



    entire equality before the law and all these things will follow. Let not the law be a



    respecter of persons. The humbler the man the greater the necessity that the law should



    not oppress him. The rich and great can take care of themselves. With all the opportunites



    of equal laws, the poor man's lot is hard enough. He requires the protection of the law



    and the self respect which an equality of right before the law engenders. In a country



    where equality is the rule, we cannot have an exception founded on caste. The ballot is



    here the evidence of manhood; when we deny it to a race we at once degrade that race in



    the respect of others, and what is of greater consequence, in its own respect. Every man,



    the humbler he is the more, requires the right of suffrage for his protection. And the



    negro, as the most unprotected of all, needs it most of all. We must educate him, and give



    him the condition of self-respect, if we would have his influence for good upon our



    civilization.

    

    <P>

    

    But while we thus see the necessity of giving to the negro equality before



    the law, even upon the assumption that his presence is a necessary evil, let us not forget



    that this is indeed far from the truth. We need his labor in the South and we need the



    protection of his ballot against the ballot of his former traitorous master.

    

    <P>

    

    And further, if we educate him and place him in a position in which he will respect



    himself, we may expect the most gratifying results to the common good. In an economic view



    this is a matter of the greatest moment. The increased production of an intelligent,



    self-respecting and industrious population can hardly be estimated. In the South thrift



    will take the place of waste; voluntary labor directed by an enlightened self-interest



    will take the place of compulsory labor directed by the lash; provident abstinence will



    save for a reserved fund, that which has heretofore been lost in careless expenditure.



    Fixed capital will thus arise; towns will spring up; the industrial arts will be



    cultivated; and prosperity and wealth will abound where want and poverty have prevailed.



    That rich southern soil with its generous climate, is a mine of untold wealth. It needs



    but the hand of free industry to bring it forth. All this would greatly contribute to



    lightening the load of our debt. These grateful people would gladly aid in the payment of



    the ransom for their redemption.

    

    <P>

    

    My friends, every consideration which ought to influence human conduct,



    requires that the ballot should be given to the black man.

    

    <P>

    

    The protection of the black man himself requires it; gratitude for his



    devoted loyalty requires it; the protection of our civilization from the influence of a



    degraded and barbarous element requires it; the protection of ourselves from the insidious



    rebel ballot requires it; the speedy restoration of the rebel states to their proper



    relation to the General Government requires it; the fundamental principles of our



    Government require it; the Golden Rule of our most holy religion commanding us to do unto



    others as we would that they should do unto us, requires it. Can we withhold it?<BR>
