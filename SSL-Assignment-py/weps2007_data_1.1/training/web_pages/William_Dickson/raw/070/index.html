      <p>Curved around the brow on a point along the Illinois River, Dickson Mounds 
        reportedly resembled a single, large, thickened crescent with blunt points. 
        This conspicuous position caused much speculation about the structure, 
        but it was generally accepted that the mounds contained burials. The mounds 
        were built by the Mississippians who left not a written record, but clues 
        from their village sites and in the mounds they constructed. By establishing 
        their com&shy;munity at the confluence of two rivers, the people were 
        able to enjoy all that the floodplain offered. Their com&shy;munity existed 
        for nearly 20 generations. The area soil (developed in loess) made the 
        mounds ideal for archaeological exploration. Loess soil has a high calcium 
        oxide content and contains almost none of the acids that break down the 
        general structure of bone. In addition, loess is soft, easily troweled, 
        and unusually stable. The skeletal remains are in a nearly perfect state.<br>
        <br>
        William Dickson migrated from Kentucky and settled the land that encompassed 
        the mounds. In the late 1860s he cleared the burial area of brush and 
        trees in prepara&shy;tion for planting an orchard. He encountered human 
        bones when he was digging holes to set out the trees. The bones were taken 
        to another area and reburied. Only occasionally was an artifact saved. 
        By the late 1800s the mounds became a popular source for collectors and 
        their uncontrolled digging, coupled with soil erosion, not only reduced 
        the number of skeletons and artifacts, but also altered the original shape 
        of the burial area.<br>
        <br>
        In the late 1920s Don Dickson, a son, decided to exca&shy;vate the cemetery. 
        Not to obtain relics, but due to his interest in pathology, he hoped to 
        find some correlation between the mass graves and bone pathology. All 
        the burials he encountered were left &quot;in situ&quot; for public view&shy;ing. 
        So much publicity was given to this formerly secluded spot, that the site 
        became very popular and most of Dickson's work day was spent explaining 
        his work to visi&shy;tors. Soon a fee was charged to view the remains 
        and to defray the cost of a new building. The mounds and sur&shy;rounding 
        land were sold to the State of Illinois in 1945 and transferred to the 
        Illinois State Museum in 1965. By 1972 an enlarged museum and research 
        facility opened, and through it all the burial site was the main display.<br>
        <br>
        During the 1980s, as federal legislation began to address the treatment 
        of Native American remains nationally, complaints by American Indians 
        about the Dickson Mound exhibit became frequent. In his first year (1991) 
        as Governor, Jim Edgar announced that the state would permanently close 
        the burial exhibit and revamp the museum. The upgrades would include new 
        exhibits and dramatic audiovisual programs. In September 1994, the new 
        museum opened. Its brown aggregate exterior, resembling a terraced Mississippian 
        platform mound, is situated on a bluff overlooking the Illinois and Spoon 
        Rivers. The focus had been redirected from the people who were buried 
        there to the people who had lived there.<br>
        Dickson Mounds is a National Historic site and one of the major on-site 
        archaeological museums in the country. It offers the unique opportunity 
        to explore the world of the American Indian through 12,000 years in the 
        Illinois River Valley.</p>
