<P>Dickson County lies within the limits of the western iron district of
the State, and belongs to that geological division known as the Highland
Rim. On the eastern boundary are two small tracts in creek valleys were
the Meniscus limestone appears at the surface, but with these exceptions
the outcrops are wholly from the silicious group of the Carboniferous age.
The chief stone of the county is the St. Louis limestone, which contains
the famous coral Lithostrotion Canadense. The stone is cherty, fossiliferous,
often crinoidal, sometimes silicious and argillaceous, and is very valuable.
There are three large and beautiful caves in the county which have been
explored, and are often visited by pleasure seekers. One is near <B><A HREF="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tndickso/CumberlandFurn.htm">Cumberland
Furnace</A></B>, and has been explored three miles or more. The entrance
to this cave is about ten feet square. Another cave is near Roger's Mill,
on Yellow Creek; has an entrance about 20x60 feet, and has been explored
about two miles. Bowman Cave on Sulphur Fork of Jones' Creek, and about
two and one-half miles west of Charlotte, has an entrance of only about
four feet square, but opens immediately into a large room. This cave has
been explored not over half a mile, and is a great resort for picnics.
The scenery in each cave is very beautiful. Charlotte rests upon the Lithostrotion
beds.

<P>Next to Hickman County, Dickson and Stewart rank as iron counties. The
first iron furnace established in the western country was in this county.
This was the Cumberland Furnace, which was erected in February, 1793, by
<B>Gen. James Robertson</B>. After operating the furnace for several years
<B>Gen. Robertson </B>sold the property to <B>Montgomery Bell</B>. The
furnace was abandoned by <B>Mr. Bell</B> in a short time and the present
Cumberland Furnace erected about half a mile east. This furnace is situated
on Barton's Creek, in the Eighth District, and is the only iron establishment
in the county now in operation. It is claimed, and has not been refuted,
that all the cannon balls used by <B>Gen. Jackson</B> at the battle of
New Orleans, during the was of 1812, were cast by this furnace and shipped
to that city in keel-boats. The capacity of this furnace is about twelve
tons of pig metal per day. The pig metal is hauled on wagons to Cumberland
River, a distance of about eight miles, for shipment. Worley Furnace, which
was established several years later, was operated up to the year 1874,
and was then closed and has remained so. This furnace was situated on Piney
River, in the First District. Furnaces were also established and operated
for different lengths of time before 1860, as follows: Carroll Furnace
and Bellview Furnace, on Barton's Creek in the Sixth District; Piney Furnace
on Piney Creek, in the First District; Laurel Furnace on Jones' Creek,
and Jackson Furnace on Beaver Dam, in the Fourth District. Iron forges
were erected at the same time and in conjunction with the furnaces, as
follows: Turnbull and White Bluff Forges on Turnbull Creek, in the Twelfth
District; Valley and Jones' Creek Forges, on Jones Creek, in the Sixth
District; Red House Forge on Jones Creek, Steam Forge near Cumberland River,
in the Eighth District. The ore banks are numerous and very rich, and are
to be found in almost any part of the county. Those from which ore has
been taken in limited quantities for specimens are as follows: The Ticer
Bank, one and a half miles from Charlotte, in the Sixth District; the Puckett
Bank, three miles south of Burn's Station, in the Fourth District; the
Robertson Bank, six miles west of Charlotte, in the Sixth District, and
the Contrary Pond Bank, two miles north of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;
St. Louis Railway, in the Eleventh District.

<P>In 1865 parties commenced boring for petroleum in the Jones Creek Valley.
Oil was obtained after reaching the depth of 565 feet, and several hundred
barrels were utilized. The use of inferior tools, combined with the inexperience
of the parties having the project in hand, rendered the enterprise unprofitable,
and it was abandoned. A company has lately been organized at Dickson, known
as the "Dickson Coal Oil Company," which has in view the prosecution of
the search for oil in paying quantities and qualities in the Jones Creek
Valley, and the erection of suitable works. The company is composed as
follows: <B>J. R. Bryan</B>, <B>Dr. C. M. Lovell</B>, <B>Henry Smith</B>,
<B>W. S. Coleman</B>, <B>J. T. Henslee</B>, <B>N. B. Lipe</B> and <B>Edward
Techont</B>, the two latter gentlemen living in Carroll County, Tenn. Natural
gas is supposed to exist in paying quantities in the above valley, and
negotiations are on foot looking to the early development of this resource
of the county.

<P>The J. R. Bryan &amp; Co. Lime Works have two kilns in operation one-half
mile south of Burns' Station, and J. C. Donegan &amp; Co. have one kiln
in operation at their works, a short distance north of the above works.
The former company have about $15,000 invested in their establishments,
which consists of two large kilns, with a combined capacity of 200 barrels
of lime per day; a stave and heading factory, which has a capacity of 200
barrels per day, also a general store, with a stock of about $3,000. About
fifty laborers are employed at the works. J. C. Donegan &amp; Company employ
about twelve laborers and have about $10,000 invested in their works. The
barrels used at their kiln are manufactured by J. R. Bryan &amp; Co. The
major portion of the products of these kilns is shipped to Nashville in
bulk, were it commands an average market price, while the barreled lime
is shipped into several adjoining States. The laborers employed at these
works live with their families in the little valley, and together they
form quite a village.

<P>At Colesburg, in the Fifth District, a sumac-mill is operated, which
grinds several tons of leaves per day. This promises to be an important
industry for Dickson County, as the sumac grows in abundance on all the
waste lands, and when prepared for market, brings from $70 to $90 per ton.
Kingston Station is 506 feet above the sea level; Turnbull Creek Bottom,
459 feet; Sullivan Creek, 473 feet; six miles west of Kingston Station,
on the railroad, 819 feet; eight miles farther west 862 feet; six miles
farther west, 915 feet; and Gordon's Creek, 736 feet above. The prominent
creeks are Yellow, Barton's, Jones', Piney, Johnson, Harpeth, Turnbull,
Gordon's, Sulphur Fork and Town Branch of Jones' and Bear.

<P>The first land entries bear evidence of the presence of white men in
this county as early as 1786. These entries were in the nature of military
land grants which were issued by the governors of North Carolina for services
rendered in the Continental war, and were as follows: <B>John Hogg</B>
640 acres, in 1786; <B>John Johnston</B> 1,500 acres and <B>Oliver Smith</B>
640, in 1791; <B>Hezekiah Barnes</B> 350 acres and <B>Edward Dickson</B>
640 acres, in 1792; <B>John King</B> 457 acres in 1793; <B>James West</B>
4,800 acres, <B>John Davis</B> 1,280 acres; <B>Benjamin E. Randolph</B>
1,000 acres, and <B>Charles Stewart</B> 1,280 acres in 1795; <B>Aaron Lambert
</B>274 acres, in 1796;<B> Joseph Kemp</B> 274 acres, <B>Charles Stewart</B>
640 acres, <B>George Ward</B> 274 acres, <B>Sterling Brewer </B>300 acres
and <B>Robert Lanier</B>, 640 acres, in 1797; <B>William Hill</B> 320 acres,
in 1807; <B>Jesse S. Ross</B> 200 acres, in 1808; <B>William Tynell</B>
360 acres, in 1809; <B>Thomas Mathis</B> 74 acres, in 1810; <B>Thomas Garay
</B>50 acres, <B>Henry Wert</B> 20 1/2 acres, and <B>Spilsley Tribble</B>
820 acres, in 1811. Among those who located on the waters of Barton's Creek
during the nineties were <B>Gen. James Robertson</B>, who came from Nashville;
<B>John Nesbitt</B>, from South Carolina; <B>Hudson Johnson</B>, from North
Carolina; <B>Abraham Caldwell</B>, from Ireland; <B>Richard Napier</B>,
from Virginia, and <B>Montgomery Bell</B> from Pennsylvania. Those who
settled about the same time on Jones' Creek were <B>Christopher Strong</B>,
<B>Reace Borran</B>, <B>William Cox</B>, <B>Molton Dickson</B>, <B>James
Martin</B>, <B>James Steel</B> and <B>Eleazer Smith</B>, from North Carolina;
<B>Robert Harper</B>, from Ireland; <B>John Larkins</B> and <B>Fiel Farrer</B>,
from South Carolina, and <B>Gabe Joslin</B>, from Nashville. Johnson's
Creek, same time, <B>George Tubbs</B>, from South Carolina; <B>Charles
Teal</B>, from Maryland, and <B>William Ward</B>, from Virginia. Yellow
Creek, the same time, <B>George Turner </B>and <B>John Adams</B>, from
Virginia; <B>John Le Masters</B>, from North Carolina, and <B>Jerry Nesbitt</B>,
from South Carolina. Turnbull Creek, <B>Edward Tidwell</B>, <B>John Brown</B>,
<B>Samuel Sellers</B>, and <B>Minor Bibb</B>, from South Carolina, and
<B>Milton Johnson</B>, <B>William and Thomas Gentry </B>and <B>William
Pullen </B>from Virginia. On Piney River, <B>William Hogins</B> from Virginia,
and <B>Nicholas and Hutson Dudley</B> and <B>Thomas Petty</B>, from North
Carolina. Other settlers of that period were <B>Robert Crumpler</B>, who
came from North Carolina and settled on Town Branch of Jones' Creek and
<B>Thomas Fannel</B>, who came from Virginia and settled near what is now
Charlotte.<B> Richard Warway</B>, <B>George Southerland</B>, <B>Hugh NcNeiley</B>,
<B>Christopher Robertson</B>, <B>Nathan Crumpler</B>, <B>Daniel and Jacob
Leach</B>, <B>Daniel Williams</B>, <B>James Nosworthy</B>, <B>William Fussel</B>,
<B>James Walker</B>, <B>John Spencer</B>, <B>Anthony Vanlier</B>,<B> John
Hendrickson</B>, <B>Epps Jackson</B>,<B> Elias Napier</B>, <B>Robert and
Hicks Boxter</B>, <B>William Doak</B>, <B>William Russell</B>, <B>Lemuel
Harvey</B>, <B>Jesse Craft</B>, <B>William Caldwell</B>, <B>John Hall</B>,
<B>James Fentress</B>, <B>John Burton</B>, <B>William Brasier</B>, <B>Redner
Adams</B>, <B>Thomas Simpson</B>, <B>Robert Stington</B>, <B>Moses Smith</B>,
<B>Cornelius Magraw</B>, <B>William Moore</B>, <B>Samuel Parker</B>, <B>Burgiss
Harris </B>and<B> Thomas Mitchell </B>were among the settlers who came
to Dickson County between 1800 and 1810.

<P>Two block-houses, or forts, were built for protection. These forts were
rude but strong log houses, with doors and windows made of puncheons, calculated
to withstand both bullets and arrows, and were situated near Cumberland
Furnace and the town of White Bluff. There is only one instance on record
where the life of a settler was taken by Indians in the county. In 1809
the Indians went upon a general raid, and much property and not a few lives
were destroyed. One band of them crossed Duck River and came into this
county, and raided the farm of <B>Col. William Garner</B>, on the creek
by that name, and after killing the Colonel, drove away most of his stock.
Several large grave-yards used by the Indians are situated in the county.
Until 1800 there were no roads through Dickson County, the nearest approach
to one being simply a trail, running from the Cumberland River to the head
of Yellow Creek, passing through what is now Charlotte. In about 1810 or
1812 a road was established from Nashville to Charlotte, and from the latter
place on to the Southern States.

<P>The first man licensed by the county court to keep a general store was
<B>John Holland</B>, who in 1806, opened a store in the county (the location
of which cannot be ascertained), and sold dry goods, notions, groceries
and whisky. The same year <B>Burton Scroggins</B> was granted a license
to keep an ordinary. The first corn-mills of which there is any recollection
were built along in 1800. Probably the first one was on Jones' Creek, and
was built by <B>Arter West</B>. The building was a one-story log structure,
about 25x30 feet in dimensions, and was water-power. Similar mills were
erected about the same time on Jones Creek by <B>Christopher Strong</B>;
on Yellow Creek, by <B>John Adams</B>; on Piney River, by <B>William Edwards</B>;
also one near the Hickman County line on Piney River, by <B>James Davis</B>.
The mills of the present are as follows: First District, corn and saw-mill,
water-power, on Piney River, owned by <B>Ira Dugan</B>; Second District,
corn-mill, water-power, on branch of Piney River, owned by <B>Buck Murrell</B>;
Third District, corn and flour-mill, water-power, on Parker's Creek, owned
by <B>Samuel Spencer</B>; Fifth District (Dickson), steam flour-mill owned
by <B>T. F McCreary</B>; Sixth District, corn-mill, steam-power, on Sulphur
Fork, owned by <B>W. M. Larkins</B>; saw-mill, steam, owned by <B>Heath
&amp; Jennnings</B>; corn-mill, water-power, on Jones Creek, owned by <B>William
Jordon</B>; Seventh District, corn-mill, steam-power, owned by <B>Jacob
Hand</B>; Eighth District, corn and flour-mill, steam-power owned by<B>
E. N. Phipps</B>; Ninth District, corn mill, water-power, and saw-mill,
steam-power, owned by <B>Thomas Rogers</B>; Twelfth District (White Bluff),
corn and flour-mill, steam-power, owned by <B>Alexander Kerr</B>; corn
and flour-mill, steam-power, owned by <B>F. P. Jones</B>; saw-mill, steam-power
owned by <B>Henry Taylor</B>. Still-houses were numerous from the very
early days of the settlement until the breaking out of the civil war. The
distilleries were long, low, log houses, and were supplied with the old-fashioned
copper worm. The beer would be run off one day, allowed to cool for a day,
and then run through the worm again on the third day. The capacity of the
average still was about one barrel per day. Stills were owned by <B>Hudson
Johnson</B> on Barton's Creek, by <B>John Adams</B> on Yellow Creek, by
<B>Christopher Strong</B> and <B>Daniel Leach</B> on Johnson's Creek, <B>Abraham
Caldwell</B> on Barton's Creek, <B>Minor Bibbs</B> on Turnbull Creek, and
by <B>John Talum</B>, <B>William Hogan </B>and <B>Lum Bruce</B> in the
First District. These were the early stills from the first down to the
last, in the order named.

<P>There were no offices in Dickson County until 1806, when the first one
was established at Charlotte, of which <B>Richard Waugh</B> was probably
the first postmaster. Other early postmasters were <B>Absolom Massie</B>,
<B>Robert McNeiley</B> and <B>William James</B>. The postoffices of the
county at present are as follows: Second District, Hazel Ridge; Third District,
Spencer's Mill; Fourth District Burns and Larkins; Fifth District, Dickson
and Colesburg; Sixth District, Charlotte and Cloverdale; Seventh District,
Bellsburgh; Eighth District, <B><A HREF="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tndickso/CumberlandFurn.htm">Cumberland
Furnace</A></B> and Bufrange; Ninth District, Wood's Valley; Tenth District,
Batson's Store; Eleventh District, Cave Mill, Danielsville and Dull; Twelfth
District, White Bluff; Thirteenth District, Gillam. The principal slave
owners of Dickson County were as follows: <B>Anthony W. Vanlier</B> owned
about 100; <B>Montgomery Bell</B>, 200; <B>Dr. E. W. Napier</B>, 50; <B>Henry
Napier</B>, 40; <B>George Napier</B>, 75; <B>Joab Hardine</B>, 30; <B>Benjamin
and Theodrick Collier</B>, 50; <B>William S. Fentress</B>, 100, and <B>Thomas
McNeiley</B>, 24.

<P>In May, 1830, Dickson County was visited by a very destructive hurricane.
The court house and jail at Charlotte were demolished. The books and papers
in the former building were scattered in every direction for miles, and
many of them entirely destroyed. Several large books were carried by the
wind into Cheatham County, and afterward recovered. A man was in the second
story of the court house when the storm occurred, and was completely buried
in the rubbish, but escaped serious injury. The roof of the jail was carried
over thirteen miles. Charlotte was damaged by this storm to the extent
of about $30,000, and the balance of the county as much more.

<P>Dickson county has a population of nearly 14,000 of which there were
2,700 voters at the 1884 election, nearly five-sixths being Democrats.
In 1855 the population was 8,404, of which number 6,286 were white, and
2,118 were slaves. Financially the county is in an excellent condition,
it being entirely free from debt and its orders selling at par. The tax
levy on the $100 for the present year is as follows: County purposes, 30
cents; school, 20 cents; road 10 cents. The total number of acres in the
county assessed for taxation, in 1885, was 283,511, and the total value
of real and personal property assessed at $859,480, while the total taxes
amount to $12,966. The Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway (St.
Louis Division) passes through the county east and west, and the Nashville
&amp; Tuscaloosa Railway has its northern terminus at Dickson, but from
neither road does the county derive any revenue, as by their charters each
road is exempt from taxation for the period of twenty years from the date
of their completion, and that date will not expire until 1888. In 1885
there were 3,760 horses and mules in Dickson County, 7,970 cattle, 5,640
sheep and 22,670 hogs. The cereal products of the county in the above year
were barley, 30 bushels; buckwheat, 117 bushels; corn 616,422 bushels;
oats, 50,735 bushels; rye, 555 bushels; wheat, 45,318 bushels.

<P>Dickson County is bounded north by the counties of <B><A HREF="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tnhousto/index.htm">Houston</A></B>
and<B><A HREF="http://www.tngenweb.org/montgomery/"> Montgomery</A></B>,

and west by <B><A HREF="http://www.tngenweb.usit.com/humphreys/">Humphreys</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tnhousto/">Houston</A></B>. The
county was named in honor of <B>William Dickson</B>, of North Carolina,
who was a United States surveyor. The county was erected out of the counties
of <B><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/tngenweb/robtco.htm">Robertson</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="http://www.tngenweb.usit.com/montgomery/">Montgomery</A></B>
October 25, 1803, by the following enactment:

<P>AN ACT ERECTING PART OF ROBERTSON AND MONTGOMERY COUNTIES INTO A SEPARATE
AND DISTINCT COUNTY
<BR>Section 1. <I>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
Tennessee</I>. That a new county by the name of Dickson be, and hereby
is erected and established out of that part of Robertson and Montgomery
comprehended within the bounds following, to wit: Beginning on the south
bank of Cumberland River, were the line which separates the counties of
Robertson and Davidson intersects the same, running thence down said river
to a point half a mile below Fayetteville; yhence southwardly to a line
which shall intersect Barton's Creek, one-half mile north of the forge;
thence due west to a stake or point one (1) mile east of the east boundary
line of Stewart County; thence south to the southern boundary of this State;
thence east with said southern boundary to the southwest corner of Williamson
County, as established by an act of the last session of the General Assembly,
entitled " An Act to extend the jurisdiction, and to ascertain the bounds
of the counties therein mentioned;" thence north with the west boundary
lines of the counties of Williamson and Davidson, to the beginning.

<P>The above limits were materially reduced by an act of the Legislature,
passed December 3, 1807, which provide for the establishment of Hickman
County out of the south part of Dickson, and again by an act creating Humphreys
County, passed October 19, 1809, and again in the erection of Cheatham
County, by an act passed February 22, 1856, and still again by an act passed
January 23, 1871, by which a portion of the county was taken in the formation
of Houston County. The county at present contains 470 square miles. Section
2 provided that the first court of pleas and quarter session should be
held by the justice at the dwelling house of <B>Robert Nesbitt</B>, on
Barton's Creek, the first Monday in February next Section 3 provided for
holding elections and musters. Section 4 provided that the sheriffs of
Robertson and Montgomery Counties should collect taxes in the respective
parts stricken off for the ensuing year, and tax arrearages for preceding
years. Section 5 appointed <B>James Elder</B>, surveyor, to run the line
between the counties of Montgomery and Dickson, and authorized him to hire
assistants, the expense to be paid by Dickson County. Section 6 made Dickson
County part of the electoral district to which Robertson and Montgomery
Counties belonged. Section 7 provided that the sheriffs of Robertson, Montgomery,
Stewart and Dickson Counties should meet at Clarksville the Monday succeeding
elections, to compare the rates, and that the sheriff of Robertson County
should certify the poll for governor, representative to congress and representatives
to the General Assembly for the counties of Robertson and Dickson.

<P>By a supplemental act, passed November 7, 1803, the sheriff of Dickson
County was directed to hold an election the first Thursday in June, and
the succeedings day, at the place of holding courts, to elect field officers
for the county; and the justices in that part of Dickson stricken from
Montgomery County were authorized to continue their duties in the new county.
By an act passed August 3, 1804, <B>Robert Dunning</B>, <B>Sterling Brewer</B>,
<B>John Davidson</B>, <B>Montgomery Bell</B> and <B>George Clark</B> were
appointed commissioners to fix on the most central and suitable situation
for the erection of a court house, prison and stocks for Dickson County,
whose duty it was to purchase forty acres of land on the most reasonable
terms, on some part of which the above buildings were to be erected. The
commissioners were also authorized to lay off the said forty acres into
a town, to be called Charlotte, and to sell said town lots, and with the
proceeds of such sales erect and pay for the court house, prison and stocks,
and should the money derived from such sales be insufficient to pay all
the costs incurred in erecting such buildings, the county court was authorized
to levy a tax for such purchase. Pursuant to the above act <B>Montgomery
Bell</B>, <B>William Doak</B>, <B>William Russell</B>, <B>Sterling Brewer</B>,
<B>Gabriel Allen</B>, <B>William Teas</B>, <B>Lemuel Harvey</B>, <B>Jesse
Croft</B> and <B>Richard C. Napier</B>, the justices provided for by said
supplemental act, met and qualified on Monday, March 19, 1804, at the residence
of <B>Col. Robert Nesbitt</B>. The house in which the first session of
the county court was held remains standing in very good repair, being occupied
by a grandson of <B>Col. Nesbitt</B>. It is a one-story log building, and
stands about three miles north of the county seat. After appointing <B>Robert
Drake</B>, clerk <I>pro. tem</I>., and <B>Drury Christian</B>, sheriff
<I>pro tem</I>., the court adjourned over until 11 o'clock the next day,
when it again met, and there being a full attendance of justices the following
officers were elected to serve until the next regular election should be
held. Clerk, <B>Daniel Dickson</B>; sheriff, <B>Benjamin Weakley</B>; register,
<B>James Walker</B>; commissioner of revenue, <B>Robert Drake</B>; county
trustee, <B>John Larkins</B>; wood ranger, <B>William Caldwell</B>; corner,
<B>John Hall</B>; all of whom were qualified and entered upon the discharge
of their official duties. One of the first acts of the court was to appoint
<B>Ezekiel Norris</B>, general, and <B>James Fentress</B> special guardian
of <B>John Davis</B>, son of <B>John Davis</B>, deceased, and to order
a road laid off leading from Yellow Creek to the Montgomery County line,
on the middle fork of Barton's Creek.

<P>The following jury was appointed to serve at the following June court
of pleas and quarter sessions: <B>John Burton</B>, <B>Redner Adams</B>,
<B>William Brasier</B>, <B>William Runland</B>, <B>Howel Adams</B>, <B>Andrew
Giffin</B>, <B>Robert Nesbitt</B>, <B>Thomas Simpson</B>, <B>Samuel Walker</B>,<B>
Simeon Walker</B>, <B>James Ross</B>, <B>Lewis Russell</B>, <B>John Larkins,
Jr.</B>, <B>Robert Stington</B>, <B>John Ward</B>, <B>Moses Smith</B>,
<B>Nathan Nesbitt</B>, <B>Hugh Robertson</B>, <B>Samuel Hartly</B>, <B>Matthew
Gilmore</B>, <B>Edward Lucas</B>, <B>Cornelius Magraw</B>, <B>Andrew Caldwell</B>,
<B>Burgess Harris</B>, <B>John Holland</B>, <B>Robert Norris</B>, <B>William
Moore</B>, <B>Samuel Parker</B>, <B>Thomas Mitchell</B>, <B>James Woods</B>,<B>
Earl Hutchen</B>, <B>Thomas Napier</B>, <B>Stephen Ward</B>,<B> Levi Hand</B>,
<B>Michael Dickson</B>, <B>William McKnight</B>, <B>Charles Walker</B>
and <B>John Davidson</B>, and out of the above a grand jury of fourteen
and a foreman were selected at the meeting of court.

<P>At the June term of the county court the prices regulating the Harpeth
River ferry, were established. For man and horse, 12 1/2 cents; single
horse, 6 1/4 cents; footman, 6 1/4 cents; sheep and hogs per head, 1 1/4
cents; wagon and team, $1; two-wheel carriages, 50 cents; cattle per head,
6 1/4 cents. Indictments were returned by the grand jury at this term as
follows: <B>David Ross</B>, rescuing; <B>William Carrin</B>, trespass and
assault and battery; <B>John Craft</B>, assault and battery.

<P>From the year 1808 until the year 1815 there are no records to show
the proceedings of the county court, but during that time the commission
appointd by the said act carried out the instructions contained therein
and selected a county site at what is now Charlotte.&nbsp; The land was
owned by <B>Charles Stewart</B>, who, in 1808, donated fifty acres to the
commission upon which to locate the county site, and lay off a town, which
was christened Charlotte. Upon being platted the lots were sold to the
highest bidders, and with the money derived from the sale the public buildings
were erected. Just when these buildings were completed cannot at this late
day be ascertained, as the records of the county court between the years
1808 and 1817 have been lost or destroyed. However, it was some time between
1810 and 1812 that the buildings were finished and moved into. The court
house, a large substantial brick, was erected at a cost of between $10,000
and $12,000. It was square in shape, two stories in height, the county
offices being below on the first floor, and the whole of the second floor
being used as a court room. There were four entrances to the building,
all opening into a large hall. A large circular belfry surmounted the roof.
The jail was also a two-story brick building, being also a sheriff's residence,
and cost about $4,000. Both the court house and jail were destroyed by
the storm of 1830, but were rebuilt by the county court, during the following
year, in the same places and in the same style and manner, and at about
the same cost. The sessions of the court were held in the public school
house until the new buildings were erected. <B>Peter Seals</B> was the
first man sent to the State prison from Dickson County, and he was sent
there by the county court in 1830, for whipping his wife.

<P>Previous to 1836 the poor of the county were kept by different individuals
in the separate civil districts, at the expense of the county, appropriations
being made from time to time by the county court. In the above year the
court passed an order for the purchase of ground and the erection of necessary
buildings to be used as a county asylum. The ground was purchased at a
point about two miles from Charlotte, on the Dickson road, upon which was
erected a comfortable log house, at a cost of about $400; the house was
found to be inadequate of recent years, and in 1870 the court passed another
order for the sale of the property, and for the purchase of a suitable
tract of land situated four miles from Charlotte, on the Nashville road,
upon which were erected a number of small log houses for the accommodation
of the overseer and paupers. The land and buildings cost upward of $25,000.

<P>A bit of interesting history was enacted by the county court in 1833,
which has few precedents in the State of Tennessee. It was a follows: On
the 25th of November, 1833, <B>William C. Bird</B>, a white man and a patrol,
was assaulted, by one <B>Wiley</B>, a slave, with a club and murdered.
<B>Wiley</B> was soon afterward arrested, and the county court convened
in special session on the 19th of December of the same year for the purpose
of trying the slave on the charge of murder. The trial was by jury, and
lasted three days, a verdict of guilty being returned on the third day,
fixing the penalty at death by hanging. The charge was read to the negro,
and the day of his execution being set for December 28, following, he was
remanded to jail. On the appointed day <B>Wiley</B> was taken from jail
and placed in a cart and conveyed to the place of execution. The gallows
had been erected the previous day at a point about half a mile east of
Charlotte, and was in the shape of two upright posts and a cross piece,
to which the rope was attached. Several thousand people gathered on the
surrounding hillsides and climbed up into the neighboring trees to witness
the hanging. Slave owners took their slaves to see the negro hung, hoping
thereby to give them a terrible lesson and warning. The cart bearing the
doomed man was driven between the two uprights, the noose was placed around
the slave's neck, and the driver was instructed to "drive up the cart,"
and the negro was jerked into eternity. An aged darkey preached a funeral
sermon over the remains, and delivered a solemn warning to his brethren.

<P>In 1836 the State Legislature passed an act creating the circuit court,
and one reorganizing and reconstructing the county courts of the State.
Previous to this time the county court had jurisdiction in any and all
cases, both criminal, civil and probate. But by the requirements of this
act of the Legislature, the jurisdiction of the county court was limited
to county affairs, the circuit and chancery court being given jurisdiction
over all cases of justice and equity. The county court clerks have been
as follows from the organization of the county to the present: <B>David
Dickson</B>, from 1804-13; <B>Fiel Farrar</B>, 1813-36; <B>William Hightower</B>,
1836-42; <B>Thomas J. Kelley</B>, 1842-43; <B>Thomas McNeiley</B>, 1843-59;
<B>Thomas C. Morris</B>, 1859-65; <B>F. M. Binkley</B>, 1865-70; <B>Thomas
K. Grigsby</B>, 1870-86, and is a candidate for re-election.

<P>From some time during the year 1819 until about 1821 or 1822, the Supreme
Court of the State of Tennessee held regular sessions as Charlotte. The
records of this court, or at least of its sessions held in Charlotte, have
been lost, and as there are no citizens whose memory is clear on the subject,
it is impossible to give any account of the proceedings. The judges were
three in number, and were probably <B>Haywood</B>, <B>Emmerson</B> and
<B>Catron</B>.

<P>The Circuit Court of Dickson County, in common with similar courts throughout
the State, was established by an act of the Legislature of Tennessee passed
January 25, 1836. By this act Dickson County was placed in the Seventh
Judicial District, of which <B>Hon. Mortimer A. Martin</B> was judge, and
<B>William K. Turner</B> was attorney-general. Previous to that time the
county court had full jurisdiction in all cases, both criminal and civil.
During the war of the Rebellion the records of the circuit court were damaged
and destroyed to a considerable extent, and of the first three years' proceedings
of the court there is now no record, the dockets and minute books being
entirely lost. The first session of the court, of which there is a record,
was held in the court house at Charlotte, beginning on the second Monday
of June, 1839, over which <B>Judge Martin</B> presided. The first grand
jury, of which there is a record, also met at this term of court, and was
composed of the following gentlemen: <B>Willie Bothrop</B>, <B>John S.
Spencer</B>, <B>William Willey</B>, <B>David Frazier</B>, <B>William White</B>,
<B>Jesse Graham</B>, <B>Elisha Lloyd</B>, <B>James Loggins</B>, <B>Lawson
Gunn</B>, <B>Thomas McMurry</B>, <B>Josiah Ferrill</B> and <B>Berryman
S. Walker</B>, of which <B>Willie Bothrop</B> was chosen foreman. Among
the indictments returned by this grand jury were one against <B>Warren
Hill</B> for drunkenness, and <B>James Bruce</B> of assault and battery.
<B>Jesse Norris</B> was convicted of grand larceny at the February term,
1842, and sent to the penitentiary for three years. At the February term,
1843, <B>Richard Hutson</B> was sent to the penitentiary for three years
on the charge of horse stealing. At the June term of the same year <B>Henry
D. James </B>was sent to the county jail for one hour on being convicted
of the charge of rescue. <B>Aaron D. Cochran</B> was convicted of usury
at the February term, 1844, and fined $25, while at the following term
<B>William H. Nichols</B> and <B>William Baker</B> were tried and acquitted
of the charge of murder.

<P>From the October term, 1845, until the June term, 1855, the records
are missing. At the latter date<B> John Luther </B>was sent to the penitentiary
for four years for harboring slaves, <B>Scarborough Penticost</B> was acquitted
of the charge of killing of one <B>Edwards</B>, and the entire family of
<B>Samuel H. Moran</B>, including himself, wife and four children, were
bound over to keep the peace of twelve months, each one being required
to give $500 bond.

<P><B>Willis Johnson</B> was tried and convicted of the murder of <B>John
Welsh</B> at the February term, 1857, and sent to the penitentiary for
six years. <B>P. H. Hamilton</B> was convicted of forgery at the February
term, 1859, and sent to the penitentiary for three years, and at the following
term <B>Sanford Higgs</B>, <B>Henry and Andrew Elridge</B> were convicted
on the double charge of murder and arson and each sent to the penitentiary
for fifteen years. At the October term, 1861, <B>John H. and W. J. H. Ross</B>
and <B>D. A. Gallighy </B>were convicted of murder in the first degree
and sentenced to be hung. Their case was taken to the supreme court at
Nashville, and the prisoners were liberated by the Federal soldiers when
that city was captured during the war. Beginning with May, 1862, the circuit
court transacted little or no business for several terms, and were finally
abandoned and were not opened again until after the close of the war, when
the first session was held in June, 1866. At that term <B>Thomas Smith</B>
was sent to the penitentiary for stealing a hog. At the February term,
1867, <B>Willis Holt</B> and <B>Wesley Hood</B> were each sent to the penitentiary
for fifteen years for stealing a horse. <B>Betty Nixon</B> was convicted
of grand larceny at the October term, 1868, and sent to the penitentiary
for one year.<B> Nathan Bowan</B>, colored, was convicted of the murder
of <B>Robert Collins</B> at the June term, 1870, and sent to the penitentiary
for ten years. <B>Samuel Porter</B> was convicted of the murder of <B>Jack
Snowden</B> at the March term, 1871, and sent to the penitentiary for ten
yers, and at the following July term <B>Henry White</B> was sent to the
penitentiary for life for the murder of <B>Stanford Donnegan</B>. At the
March term, 1876, <B>Jesse Dowing</B>, colored, was sent to the penitentiary
for sixteen years upon a charge of ku-klux. <B>William Still</B> was sent
to the penitentiary for three years on the charge of grand larceny at the
July term, 1879, and was tried and convicted on the same charge at the
March term, 1880, and sent back for three years more. <B>Andrew White</B>
was tried at the March term, 1881, on the charge of larceny and sent to
the penitentiary for sixteen years, and at the following term <B>White</B>
was tried on the charge of murdering <B>James Clardy</B> and was convicted
and sentenced to be hung, but his sentence was commuted by the governor
to imprisonment in the penitentiary for life. At the March term, 1885,
<B>Warren Bishop</B> was sent to jail for ten days for committing manslaughter,
and at the following November term<B> Jeff Clark</B> was sent to the penitentiary
for ten years for murder, and <B>John Grace</B> was convicted of the murder
of <B>D. W. Price</B> and sent to the penitentiary for five years.

<P>The soldiers furnished by Dickson County to the <B><A HREF="http://www.cfcsc.dnd.ca/links/milhist/1812.html">war
of 1812</A></B> were as follows: <B>John B. Walker</B>, <B>Thomas Edwards</B>,
<B>David McAdoo</B>, <B>William James</B>, <B>Benjamin Swift</B>, <B>Daniel
Williams</B>, <B>James Bell</B>, <B>Thomas Williams</B>, <B>James Daniels</B>,
<B>Thomas Gilbert</B>, <B>William Porter</B>, <B>John Jones</B>, <B>John

<B>Obediah Spradlin</B>, <B>Abraham Heath</B>, <B>Simon Deloach</B>, <B>Jesse

<B>Allen Bowen</B>, <B>Richard Watkins</B>, <B>Lansom Gunn</B>, <B>Anderson
England</B> and <B>Edward Niblack</B>. Those who went from Dickson County
into the <B><A HREF="http://www.usigs.org/library/military/links/ind.htm">Florida
war of 1836</A></B>, in <B>Capt. James Tatum's</B> company, were <B>Alexander
Jones</B>, <B>Moses Street</B>, <B>Abraham Street</B>, <B>Allen Nesbitt</B>,
<B>Mortimer Edwards</B>, <B>Joseph Parrish</B>, <B>William Tatom</B>, <B>James
Hudgins</B>, <B>James Young</B>, <B>Hudson Shropshire</B>, <B>John Linke</B>,
<B>Washington Weems</B> and <B>William Young</B>. When the call was made
for volunteers to serve in the <B><A HREF="http://www.cfcsc.dnd.ca/links/milhist/mexus.html">Mexican
war</A></B>, in 1846, Dickson County responded promptly by raising two
full companies, but before they could report at Nashville, Tenn., the quota
was already full, and they were rejected. However, several members of the
companies succeeded in getting into the service, and served throughtout
the war. They were <B>W. J. Mallory</B>, <B>James Hudgins</B>, <B>William
Tate</B>, <B>John Owens</B>, <B>Bass Ferrell </B>and <B>John Morris</B>.

<P>The part taken by Dickson County in the <B><A HREF="http://www.usigs.org/library/military/links/civ.htm">war
of the Rebellion</A></B> was a conspicuous one. She not only furnished
her quota of soldiers to the Confederate Army, but was the scene of stirring
events during the four years in which the war was waged. Until <B>President
Lincoln</B> issued his call for 75,000 volunteers the people of Dickson
County were rather disposed to remain passive and, if possible, maintain
a neutral position on the question of secession. But the call to take up
arms against the people of the South served to ignite a spark of indignation
in their breasts, and the refusal of <B>Gov. Harris </B>was received by
them with demonstrations of pleasure. Preparations were at once inaugurated
for the raising and equipment of the county's quota of State troops, and
in the first part of May following the first company was equipped and started
for Nashville, under command of <B>Capt. William Green</B>. Two days later
two more companies were started for the same destination, under command
of <B>Capts. W. J. Mallory </B>and <B>William Thedford</B>. The companies
were assigned places in the Eleventh Tennessee Regiment, being designated
by letters C, H and K, in the order of captains given above. They were
then sent to Camp Cheatham, in Robertson County, for instructions.

<P>Upon another call made for volunteers, during the same year, two more
companies were organized and equipped, and left in December following,
under command of<B> Capts. Thomas H. Grigsby</B> and <B>J. B. Cording</B>;
for Fort Donelson, where they were assigned to the Forty-ninth Tennessee
Regiment, as Companies B and D, respectively. At different times during
the war the Southern Army was recruited from among the citizens of the
county; they going out in small squads and joining different commands.
After a month spent in drilling, at Camp Cheatham, Companies C, H and K
were ordered on post duty on the railroad between Hainsville and Knoxville.
Under <B>Gen. Zollicoffer</B> they next went to Rock Castle, Ky., and participated
in the battle of Fishing Creek, on the morning of the 19th of January,
1862, that being their first engagement. Their next engagement was at the
siege of Cumberland Gap and next at the battle of Murfreesboro, December
31, 1862. The battles of Chickamauga, Mission Ridge, the memorable retreat
from Dalton to Atlanta, Franklin, Nashville and the march to North Carolina
were also participated in by the Dickson County boys. They were surrendered
to <B>Gen. Sherman</B> April 9, 1865. Companies B and D, as above stated,
went from Dickson County to Fort Donelson, where they experienced their
initiative fighting. After the surrender the members of the two companies
were taken to Alton, Ill., where the officers and men were separated, the
former being taken to St. Louis, then to Camp Chase, Ohio, and next to
Johnson's Island, while the latter were sent to Camp Douglas, Chicago,
Ill., all being held as prisoners of war. The sketch of their service appears
elsewhere in this volume. At the final surrender of the army there remainedbut
one man of Company B,<B> William H. Taylor</B>.

<P>In 1862, a party of about sixty Federal soldiers visited the county
on a raid, and a slight skirmish occurred between them and a band of guerrillas
a few miles out from Charlotte, in which no damage was sustained by either
side. During the latter part of November, 1863, a portion of two Federal
regiments, numbering between 300 and 400, took possession of Charlotte.
They were under command of <B>Maj. Kirwine</B>, and remained in Charlotte
until the middle of March, 1864. They established headquarters in the court
house, and erected barracks all around the court yard, and christened the
same as "Camp Charlotte." During those months much damage was done to the
town in addition to "eating the citizens out of house and home." The records
in the court house were mutilated and destroyed and in an inexcusable and
wanton manner, and private and business houses invaded and pillaged. A
continuous fight was kept up between the Federals and guerrillas, and not
a few lives were sacrificed as a result. In 1864 <B>William D. Willey</B>
was captured by the Federals under <B>Lieut. Donnehue</B>, and shot as
a guerrilla. The latter, it is supposed, killed <B>John Lindsey</B>, a
Federal sympathiser, during the same year, and in a short time thereafter
<B>Demps Dobson</B>, a guerrilla, was captured by the Federals, and taken
about a mile north of Charlotte and shot. When friends of the dead man
went after the body to give it decent burial, they found in his hand a
scrap of paper, on which was written, "Shot in retaliation for the killing
of <B>John Lindsey</B>." <B>M. Gilbert</B>, a citizen of Charlotte, was
also killed by the Federals. The Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
Railway (then known as the Northwestern Railway) was guarded by detachments
of Federals stationed at White Bluff, Burris' Station, Cox Springs and
Gillam Station. The Federal Army had a large amount of stores and a considerable
number of soldiers at Johnsonville, on the Tennessee River, in 1864, about
the time <B>Gen. Hood</B> was moving on Nashville, and <B>Gen. Forrest</B>
was dispatched to undertake their capture. The Federal troops no sooner
learned the movements of that General than they were off for Nashville
in hot haste. They reached Charlotte in a state of demoralization, having
left behind them a trail marked by guns, ammunition, blankets, flour, meal,
meat and in fact everything they found unhandy to carry in their flight.
After passing through Charlotte and proceeding a mile or two they received
word that <B>Gen. Forrest</B> had gotten between them and Nashville. This
was the signal for retreat, and all moved rapidly to Clarksville.

<P>Nothing, comparatively, can now be learned of the religious condition
and happenings in Dickson County prior to the year 1800. At that time the
<B><A HREF="http://www.gcah.org/">Methodists</A></B>, Baptists and <B><A HREF="http://www.libertynet.org/pacscl/phs/index.html">Presbyterians</A></B>
had organizations in the county, though no church houses had been erected,
and services, when held, were conducted in private residences, or during
the pleasant weather season in some shady grove. Probably the first church
erected in the county was a log building, which stood about half a mile
west of where Charlotte now stands, and which was built some time in 1804
by the Psalm Singers, who, some time before, led by the <B>Rev. Samuel
Brown</B>, had seceded from the Presbyterian Church. The Psalm Singers
were few in number, and, as an organization, did not live long in this
county, and a grave-yard now marks the spot where once stood their church
building.

<P>The <B><A HREF="http://www.cumberland.org/hfcpc/mcdonold/index.htm">history</A></B>
of the <B><A HREF="http://www.cumberland.org/hfcpc/">Cumberland Presbyterian
Church</A></B> in Dickson County must always abound with interest, as that
denomination, now prominent and flourishing in every State of the Union,
had its origin in this county, in a<B> <A HREF="http://www.cumberland.org/hfcpc/birthp.htm">log
house</A></B>, the home of <B>Rev. Samuel McAdoo</B>. The house in which
was planned and organized the Cumberland Presbyterian Church stood about
six miles south of Charlotte, and was an <B><A HREF="http://www.cumberland.org/hfcpc/pub.htm">old-fashioned
double log house</A></B>, a story and a half high, which was covered with
clapboards, the boards being held in place by weight poles. The chimneys
were made of wood and dirt. The logs were hewn with a broad ax, and the
cracks daubed with mud. The windows were small, and not being provided
with glass were closed by clapboard shutters, hung with wooded hinges.
In 1800 a great revival swept over portions of Kentucky and Tennessee,
during which great numbers of sinners were converted to the religious belief,
and the membership of the Presbyterian Church was increased tenfold. The
organization of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was one of, if not the
greatest, results of this revival. The great increase in membership of
the old church caused by the revival made the establishment of more churches
and ordaining of new ministers a necessity, and although there were many
able and pious men among the new preachers, the mother church refused to
ordain them because of their lack of education, they not being possessed
of a regular collegiate and classic education, and also because of their
unsoundness of faith respecting the doctrines of election and predestination.
They were also objected to on the ground of being too noisy in their meetings,
they believing and practicing the revival system of securing conversions
to the church. After a period of contention and dissatisfaction lasting
several years and separation was effected. February 3, 1810, <B>Revs. Finis
Ewing</B>, <B>Samuel King</B> and <B>Samuel McAdoo</B>, all regularly ordained
ministers of the Presbyterian Church, met at the residence of the latter
(in Dickson County), and after a night spent in prayer and consultation,
on the following day formed a Presbytery, which was called the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church. A few years afterward a church building was erected
about four miles northwest of Charlotte, which was christened New Hope.
This building was constructed of hewn logs, and is standing at the present
time. The next church erected by the denomination was on Johnson's Creek,
and stood about five miles northeast of Charlotte. During the thirties
three more buildings were erected by the same denomination, they being
Bethel Church on Yellow Creek, Bethlehem Church on Jones' Creek and Mount
Liberty Church, situated on a ridge about twelve miles est of Charlotte.
<B><A HREF="http://sdsspc1.physics.lsa.umich.edu/amckay/presbiob.htm#Rev. Gideon Blackburn">Rev.
Gideon Blackburn</A></B>, the able Southern preacher, and<B> Rev. John
L. Smith </B>were among the most prominent of the ministers who occupied
the pulpits of these early-day churches, and dispensed the teachings of
religion to the early settlers.

<P>Probably the first church erected by the <B><A HREF="http://www.gcah.org/">Methodists</A></B>
was Smyrna Church, some time in 1810, which was a log building, and stood
on Sulphur Fork of Jones Creek. The next was Mount Lebanon, also a log
building, and stood about half a mile south of the first church. Mount
Lebanon was rebuilt in 1880. During the thirties churches were erected
by the Methodist denomination as follows: Mount Carmel, at the head of
Barton's Creek; Soul's Chapel, on Horse Branch of Barton's Creek, and Bethany,
on the Harpeth River. The early ministers of these churches were <B>Rev.
Michael Berry</B>, who preached for sixty-two consecutive years; <B>Rev.
James Sizemore</B>, <B>Rev. Henry Hutton</B> and <B>Rev. Caleb Rucker</B>.

<P>The churches of the county by districts at the present time are as follows:

<P>Among the very early schools was one at the forks of Piney River, now
in the Second District, which was taught by <B>Alexander Campbell</B>.
The branches of&nbsp; instruction at the school consisted of reading, writing
and spelling. The average attendance was about twenty-five scholars. Another
similar school was conducted by <B>James Scott</B>, an Englishman, in the
<B>Hudson</B> and <B>Tatum</B> neighborhood, now the First District. <B>Mr.
Scott</B> was a thoroughly competent teacher and left a good record. Another
school, on Turkey Creek, was taught by <B>Jesse Ross</B>, and still another
on Piney River by <B>Little John Donnegan</B>. The first schools of any
importance in the county were located at Charlotte, the first one of which
was established some time in 1823. This school was conducted by <B>Jacob
Voorhies</B>, of New Jersey, and classical in its organization. <B>Mr.
Voorhies</B> was followed by <B>Robert Nesbitt</B>, who conducted a very
good school, but was not up to the standard of his predecessor, some time
in 1827 or 1828. <B>William James</B> opened an excellent school in the
vicinity of Charlotte which was attended by scholars from all over the
county. In 1830 a splendid school, known as Tracy Academy was established
at Charlotte, and is in use up to the present day. Latin, Greek, and all
the higher branches were taught at this school, and its pupils were not
only from all parts of the county, but came from adjoining counties, and
even other States. This school was supplied all along with excellent instructors,
the first of whom was <B>Prof. McGuiggin</B>, <B>Mrs. Richardson</B> and
then <B>Miss Farley</B> conducted the school, and in 1837 <B>Prof. E. E.
Larkins</B>, the veteran school-teacher of Houston County, now teaching
at Erin, taught for about a year, and was followed by <B>Jesse Leigh</B>,
of New Hampshire. In 1839 <B>Prof. Larkins</B> again took the school in
hand, and conducted it for two years. In 1840-43 <B>J. R. Paschall</B>
taught the school, and was succeeded in 1843 by <B>Prof. Larkins</B>, who
held the position of principal instructor until 1877. <B>Rev. J. C. Armstrong</B>,
<B>Prof. Larkins' </B>assistant the previous year, succeeded to the professorship,
and conducted the academy until 1880, at which time<B> Mr. Larkin</B> again
assumed charge, and with <B>Mrs. L. W. James</B>, as assistant, conducted
the institute until 1883. Since that time the school has been taught by
<B>Mrs. Bettie Dudley</B>, of Kentucky. These schools were all in the nature
of subscription schools, yet received assistance from the State. Some time
in 1836, a first class private school was established and taught by <B>Mr.
W. B. Bell</B>, on Barton's Creek, in what is now the Sixth District. This
school established for itself a most excellent reputation, and was and
is to-day patronized by students from all over the county. <B>Mr. Bell,
Sr.</B>, was succeeded by his son <B>W. A. Bell</B>, who conducts a school
at present, under the name of Cloverdale Academy. Recently a first-class
school, of the same natureas Cloverdale, has been opened under the name
of Edgewood School, by <B>Prof. Wade</B>, assisted by his wife, Edgewood
is on Yellow Creek, in the Eleventh District, and was opened in the spring
of 1885. The Dickson Academy, an incorporated school, is also an excellent
institute and is gaining a good reputation. This school was established
in February, 1885.

<P>The schools of Dickson County at the present time by districts are as
follows: First District has 4 schools, all white; Second District, 4 schools,
all white; Third district, 5 white schools and 1 colored; Fourth District,
6 white and 3 colored; Fifth District, 10 white and 3 colored; Sixth District,
8 white and 1 colored; Seventh District; 3 white and 3 colored; Eighth
District, 7 white and 1 colored; Ninth District; 5 white and 1 colored;
Tenth District, 5 white and 2 colored; Eleventh District, 5 white schools;
Twelfth District, 6 white schools; Thirteenth District, 2 white schools.
There are about 5,000 school children in the county, 4,000 of whom are
white and 1,000 colored. The county superintendents have been as follows:
<B>L. L. Leach</B>, 1873-77; <B>T. F. McCreary</B>, 1877-79; <B>W. G. McMillan</B>,
1879-84; <B>B. F. Harris</B>, present incumbent.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Charlotte</FONT></B>, the county seat of Dickson County,
has about 400 inhabitants, and is situated very near the center of the
county. It was laid off and platted in 1804. The land was owned by <B>Charles
Stewart</B>, who donated it to the commission appointed to select a county
site. The town contains fifty-nine lots, and is divided into blocks by
eleven streets, running east and west and north and south. The surface
of the town is very uneven, and is broken by deep ravines and washes. Town
Branch, a tributary to Jones' Creek, flows through the town.

<P>The first house, which was built of logs, was erected by <B>William
Peacock</B> in the west part of the town some time during 1804, or probably
before the town was platted. It remained standing until along in the fifties,
when it was destroyed by fire. The next house erected stood on the southwest
corner of the public square, and was built in about 1804 by <B>John H.
Hyde</B>. This was also constructed of logs. Other houses, followed, and
by the year 1815 Charlotte was a live business town and growing rapidly.
<B>John Spencer</B> was the first store-keeper; he opened up a combination
establishment in 1806, in which he kept tavern and sold whisky, dry goods,
groceries, and all kinds of provisions. <B>Thomas Martin</B> also conducted
a similar establishment the year following, and during the same year <B>Thomas
Pannell</B>, a hatter, opened up a shop and drive a brisk business in the
manufacture and sale of woolen hats. The first cabinet and furniture shop
was owned by <B>Benoni Crawford</B>, who made and sold all the furniture
used in and around Charlotte. <B>Elisha Williams</B> was the village blacksmith
from 1805 to 1808, and was followed by <B>James Morris</B> and <B>Wilkin
Corbin</B>. Among the first citizens were <B>William Peacock</B>, <B>Thomas
Pannell</B>, <B>Elisha Williams</B>, <B>James Douglas</B>, <B>John H. Hyde</B>,
<B>John Reed</B>, <B>Sterling Brewer</B>, <B>Benjamin Joslin</B>, <B>John
Spencer</B>, <B>John Ellis</B>, <B>Marable Stone</B>, <B>Christian Robertson</B>
and <B>Frank Ellis</B>. The court house was built some time between 1810
and 1812, and destroyed by a storm in 1830 and was rebuilt in 1834. The
first real tavern was established in 1810 by <B>Frank Ellis</B>. The building
stood on the northwest corner of the public square, on what is now<B> Col.
T. K. Grigsby's</B> garden patch, and opposite that gentleman's residence.
In about 1812<B> Benjamin Joslin</B> erected a large two-story tavern on
the south side of the public square, and in doing so intended to improve
the other buildings in regard to style. The old building remains standing
at the present time, being used as a tenement house. It is a conspicuous
feature of the town, its verandas and balcony catching at once the eye
of a stranger on entering Charlotte. This tavern was under the proprietorship
at different times, in the order given, of <B>Christian Robertson</B>,
next by <B>Benjamin Robertson</B>, then <B>Jonathan Hardwick</B>, <B>Thomas
McNeiley</B>, <B>Mrs. Cording</B>, and last by <B>William Balthrop</B>.
The supreme court of the State held regular sittings in Charlotte during
the years 1820-21, and the iron business being then in a flourishing condition,
the town assumed an importance as a business center and trading point of
which it cannot boast at the present. From 1820 to 1840 Charlotte enjoyed
what would now be termed a "boom." By virtue of an act of the General Assembly,
passed December 11, 1837, Charlotte was incorporated in the spring of 1838.
<B>Thomas Kelley</B> was the first mayor elected, but of the other officers
chosen at that election, nor of any proceedings of the town board from
the incorporation of the town for quite a number of years, there remain
no records. In fact until within a few years of the present there are no
records, they all having been lost, burned or otherwise destroyed. The
corporation is in force yet, with the following board of officers: mayor,<B>
Jacob Leach</B>; recorder, <B>T. H. W. James</B>; marshal, <B>W. E. Hicks</B>;
aldermen, <B>C. C. Collier</B>, <B>T. C. Morris</B>, <B>T. H. W. James</B>
and W. E. Hicks.

<P>The business men of the twenties were <B>Christopher Robertson</B>,
<B>Minor Bibbs</B>, <B>Thomas Pannell</B> and <B>Voorhies </B>and <B>Kelley</B>,
all of whom kept general merchandise. The business men of the thirties
were all general merchants, and were <B>John Ward</B>, <B>Jacob Voorhies</B>,
<B>B. A. &amp; T. M. Collier</B>, <B>William and James T. Massie</B>. Business
men of the forties were <B>William Balthrop</B>, <B>Thomas Overton</B>,
<B>Joab Harding</B> and <B>William James</B>, all of whom kept similar
stocks as their predecessors. Business men of the fifties were <B>Leach</B>
&amp; <B>Dickson</B>, <B>W. C. Collier</B>, <B>William James</B>, <B>Thomas
K. Grigsby</B>, <B>Thomas Overton</B> and <B>J. F. Davis</B>, all being
general merchants. The business men of the sixties, seventies and the present
time are <B>Mallory</B> &amp; <B>Leach</B>, general store, including drugs
and bar-room; <B>C. C. Collier</B>, general store; <B>W. C. Collier</B>,
same; <B>Bowers</B> and <B>Sizemore</B>, druggists;&nbsp; <B>T. H. W. James</B>,
notions and stationery, also postmaster, and <B>Abner Hickerson</B>, groceries
and bar-room. A first-class boarding house is conducted by <B>Mrs. Martha
Hickerson</B>, and<B> Joseph Taylor</B> operates a blacksmith shop.<B>
Jacob Leach</B>, <B>T. C. Morris</B> and <B>Hardin Leach</B> are the lawyers,
and <B>Dr. D. R. Leach</B> and <B>Dr. A. G. Castleman</B>, the physicians.

<P>The secret societies of Charlotte are Charlotte Lodge, No. 97, F. &amp;
A. M., which was organized and instituted October 6, 1842; Eureka Lodge,
No. 813, K. of H., organized December 3, 1877, and Lily Lodge, K. &amp;
L. of H., organized March 26, 1880. The Masonic lodge was at one time very
strong, but has been weakened in membership from time to time by the institution
of the following lodges of the county, the members of which were taken
from the parent lodge, No. 97; White Bluff Lodge, Dickson Lodge, Iron Lodge
at Cumberland Furnace, Rainey Camp Lodge, McAllison Lodge and Yellow Creek
Lodge. The memberships of both the lodges of K. of H., and K. &amp; L.
of H., are ordinarily strong. Charlotte has two good churches, the <B><A HREF="http://www.hows.net/worship-cgi/worshiphook.bat?DOIT=activity&ID1=37036CCPC&ID2=1&">Cumberland
Presbyterian</A></B> and Methodist South, the former having a large brick
church, which was erected directly after the close of the war, and the
latter a substantial frame building. The membershipof each is good. The
colored people also have two church organizations, they being the African
Methodist Episcopal and Baptists. One school is conducted in Charlotte,
it being the old Tracy Academy, of which mention is made in full on another
page. There is also a colored school taught in the public school season.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Dickson</FONT></B> is by far the largest town in the
county, and has about 1,000 inhabitants. It lies eight miles south of the
county seat, and is situated on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
Railroad, and is also the northern terminus of the Nashville &amp; Tuscaloosa
Railroad. Being one of the best shipping points on the road a large amount
of business is transacted by her many energetic business men. The town
was laid off and platted by <B>C. Berringer</B>, of Allegheny City, Penn.,
the owner of the land, in the spring of 1868, though a railroad station
was located on the present site of the town three years before. The first
building in Dickson was erected during the war by <B>W. H. Crutcher</B>.
It was a log house, and stood on the north side of the railroad crossing,
where now is Main Street. Another log house was erected about the same
time by <B>Mr. Crutcher</B>, which stood where <B>J. R. Bryan's</B> residence
now stands, and was built for a store-room. Before completion both buildings
were destroyed by the Federal soldiers, then encamped at Cox Springs near
by, and the material taken to that place and used in the comstruction of
quarters for the troops. The first merchant of Dickson was <B>Mr. Crutcher</B>,
who built a small log store, 16x16, during the latter part of 1865. The
stock carried by <B>Mr. Crutcher</B> was of general merchandise, and his
business was profitable. Other log houses were erected during the years
of 1866-67, among which was one used as a tavern, which stood on what is
now the corner of Main and Murrell Streets, opposite the Press office,
and was conducted by <B>C. J. Martin</B>. The town continued to grow gradually,
the buildings being erected in rapid succession, each one being on a more
improved style of architecture than the preceding one, until at the present
Dickson is an average size inland town, and has a bright future.

<P>The merchants of the latter part of the sixties and the first part of
the seventies were <B>W. H. Crutcher</B>, general store; <B>McFarland</B>

management of <B>Col. M. H. Mayes</B> and <B>Mrs. M. J. Mayes</B>, respectively.
Dickson also boasts of two first-class livery stables, the proprietors
of which are <B>Messrs. Hutton &amp; Christian</B> and <B>W. J. Mathis</B>;
there are also two blacksmith shops, which are operated by<B> Lee Shawl</B>
and <B>Stroup</B> &amp; <B>Lyttle</B>; also two wagon manufactories, the
proprietors being <B>Joseph Davis</B> and <B>Sylvis</B> &amp; <B>Best</B>;
the physicians are <B>Drs. C. M. Lovell</B>, <B>B. Z. Henslee</B> and <B>G.
W. Boyt</B>; the first and only flour and corn-mill was erected in 1876
by <B>Messrs. Nopp &amp; Loafbourn</B>, and is now owned by <B>T. F. McCreary</B>.
The mill is a first-class steam mill in which is invested capital to the
amount of $8,000. The educational facilities of Dickson are embraced in
one school, the Dickson Academy, which was opened for the admission of
scholars in February, 1885. It is a chartered school, and by its establishment
Dickson was placed under the jurisdiction of the "four-mile law," by which
the sale of liquor is prohibited. The churches of Dickson are seven in
number--five white and two colored--and are as follows: Methodist Episcopal
North, organized in 1867; Methodist Episcopal South, organized in 1872;
United Presbyterian, organized in 1871; Old School Presbyterian, organized
in 1869; Lutheran, organized in 1874, and the African Methodist Episcopal
and Methodist Episcopal South (colored). The secret societies of Dickson
are as follows: A. F. &amp; A. M., removed to Dickson from Beach Grove
in 1873; K. of H., organized in 1880; K. &amp; L. of H., organized in 1883;
G. T., organized in 1886; C. O. F., organized in 1881.

<P>The only newspaper in the county is published at Dickson, and was established
by its present publishers,<B> Messrs. Conant &amp; Freeman</B>, in 1881,
and has the appropriate name of <B><U><A HREF="http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/paper-d.htm#Dickson">The
Press</A></U></B>. This paper is a seven-column folio, and is gotten out
in a neat and readable manner, and is conducted successfully, both financially
and from a literary standpoint. The advertising patronage is liberal, while
the circulation reaches 900, more than an average for a county newspaper.
Previous to <B><A HREF="http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/paper-d.htm#Dickson">The
Press</A></B> the <B><A HREF="http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/paper-d.htm#Dickson">Dickson
County Independent</A></B> was conducted by <B>N. B. Morton</B>; that gentleman
established <B><U><A HREF="http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/paper-d.htm#Dickson">The
Independent</A></U></B> in 1878, and continued its publication for three
years. Dickson was incorporated in 1870, but the corporation was abondoned
in 1883, and the records having become misplaced an account of the proceedings
of the town board cannot be given. The town was originally called Smedsville,
in honor of a civil engineer who located the first side-track at the place,
but was subsequently changed to Dickson. The depot at Dickson is a handsome
building, and is said to be the best on the railroad between Nashville
and Chattanooga. Dickson is connected with Nashville, Burns Station and
White Bluff by telephone.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>White Bluff</FONT></B> is a flourishing town of about
300 inhabitants, situated ten miles south of the county seat, and on the
Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway. The town takes its name
from White Bluff Iron Forge, which at one time was in operation near the
present site of the village. Probably the only good highway in the county
passes through the town of White Bluff, the same being the old Charlotte
&amp; Nashville Pike. The town had its origin from having been a camp of
the Federal soldiers during the war.<B> Alexander Carr</B> was the first
man to locate in the town, he building a home for himself as soon as the
soldiers departed from that vicinity. The first merchants were <B>Morton</B>
&amp; <B>Wright</B>, who opened a general store in 1865. The next merchants
were <B>Howell </B>&amp; <B>Crumpler</B>, who set up in general merchandise
business in 1867. The merchants following for the next ten years, all of
whom kept general stores, including drugs, were <B>George W. Collier</B>,
<B>Charlton</B> &amp; <B>Hicks</B>, <B>Jackson</B> &amp; <B>Harris</B>,
<B>F. E. Willey</B>, <B>John Hagie</B>, and from that time to the present,
<B>J. G. Brown</B>, <B>C. Arnold</B> and <B>W. M. Beard</B>, all of the
above constituting the present merchants. The White Bluff Hotel is the
only public hostelry, and is presided over by<B> Mrs. Thomas Overton</B>.
White Bluff has three blacksmith and wagon shops, owned by <B>S. H. Carson</B>,
<B>Jones</B> &amp; <B>Thompson</B>, and <B>John Luther</B>. A planing-mill
has recently been established by <B>A. J. Carver </B>&amp; Co., which promises
to add much to the town in the way of business. The railroad company has
erected a neat depot. There is no school of a public nature taught immediately
in White Bluff, as the school building was destroyed by fire in 1879, and
has not as yet been rebuilt, though steps have been taken looking to the
early erection of so important a building. Several good priviate schools
constitute the educational advantages and facilities at the present.

<P>The Southern Methodists, <B><A HREF="http://www.cumberland.org/hfcpc/">Cumberland
Presbyterians</A></B> and Christians have churches at White Bluff, also
the colored Baptists and African Methodist Episcopal. White Bluff was platted
in 1867 by <B>A. Myatt</B>, and incorporated in 1879. In 1882 the corporation
was permitted to die out, and was renewed again in 1884. The corporation
was again abandoned in 1885, in order to take advantage of the four-mile-law,
and a charter was obtained for a school, which was established near the
town. White Bluff is surrounded by a spendid timber and farm country, and
has quite a bright prospect ahead. In the amount of business transacted
and as a shipping point it ranks close up to Dickson. The town is connected
by telephone with Nashville, Dickson and surrounding towns.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Burns Station</FONT></B> lies nine miles south of Charlotte,
on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway, and has a population
of about 150. Upon the completion of the railroad, in 1860, <B>Moses Tidwell</B>,
who owned the land where Burns now stands, erected a number of houses.
These houses were afterward destroyed by the Federals during the war. The
first man to engage in business at Burns was <B>William Wadkins</B>, who
in 1868 established a general store. The following year <B>Neiley</B> &amp;
<B>Stephens </B>opened a store, and in 1870 were succeeded by <B>Larkins
&amp; Son</B>. In 1872 <B>J. C. Donnegan</B> purchased <B>Mr. Wadkins'</B>
store, and in turn sold out to <B>A. Myatt</B>. In 1874 <B>William Dowden</B>
opened a general store. <B>Joseph Hendricks</B> opened one in 1880, and
<B>J. C. Allspaugh</B> one in 1881. Burns has one hotel, which is owned
by <B>F. F. Tidwell</B>, <B>T. K. Grigsby</B> and <B>W. M. Hogin</B>, and
one blacksmith shop, the property of <B>A. D. Luther</B>. Two lime works,
of which mention in made elsewhere, are located one-half mile south of
Burns. A chartered school, situated on Nail's Creek, serves both to educate
the youth of Burns and also prohibit the sale of whisky in that section.
The Primitive Baptists have the only church organization at Burns.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gillam</FONT></B>, or Tennessee City, is situated nine
miles west of Dickson, on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway,
and has a population of about fifty people. Gillam Statiion was established
upon the completion of the railroad, but was nothing more than a mere stopping
place until in 1865, when <B>Messrs. Pickett &amp; Moody</B> purchased
several acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the station and erected
a store-house, in which they sold general merchandise. The only other establishment
at that time was a blacksmith shop owned by<B> Jesse Haywood</B>. In 1868
<B>Daniel Rice</B> opened a general store at Gillam, and is to-day the
only merchant in the place. <B>Messrs. Pickett &amp; Moodey</B> having
dissolved and the latter dying, <B>Mr. Haywood </B>sold his blacksmith
shop in 1870 to <B>William England</B>, who ran the business for a few
years and then abandoned it. The first physician who practiced at Gillam
was <B>Dr. W. A. Moodey</B>, who was succeeded by <B>Dr. William Bray</B>,
and he in turn by <B>Dr. Oscar Moodey</B>. In 1886 <B>W. A. Schoenfeld</B>,
a Chicago capitalist, purchased a large tract of land lying on both sides
of the railroad, and had the same laid out and platted into 20,117 town
lots of fifty feet front, and gave the embryo city the name of Tennessee
City. Whether the scheme of establishing a city at Gillam of the dimensions
proposed by the projector will amount to anything remains to be seen. As
yet it is a town on paper only. Gillam has a good railroad depot. Bon Air,
or Colesburg, is another railroad station, and is situated two and one-half
miles east of Dickson. Bon Air has about seventy-five inhabitants. The
first business man was <B>W. H. Crutcher</B>, who began selling general
merchandise in 1863. In 1879 <B>Mr. Crutcher</B> erected a large building,
in which he opened a hotel, but did not continue in the hotel business
long, and the building is now a dwelling house. <B>J. C. Donnegan </B>opened
a store in 1870, but continued in business only a few years, selling out
to <B>F. C. Willey</B>. The present merchant is <B>J. D. Griffin</B>. At
Bon Air is located the sumac-mill of <B>J. F. Gunkle</B>, of which mention
is made elsewhere. A saw and grist-mill is run in connectiion with the
sumac-mill. A neat depot has lately been erected here.
