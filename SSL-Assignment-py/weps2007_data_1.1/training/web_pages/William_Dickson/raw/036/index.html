in the Burns community. Expanding his landholdings to 1000 acres, he and his
wife Elizabeth Greer Garton built a home for their family of ten children
around 1877. Corn, wheat, cattle, hogs, horses, mules, and donkeys were raised
by the Gartons. The family cemetery was established at the time of the

Mary Jane Noret Garton were also progressive farmers working closely with the
U. T. Extension Service and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service. Terracing,
waterways, and sowing marginal land in permanent pasture were some of the
practices put into place on the demonstration farm. Garton was recognized in
1963 with an award for his conservation efforts. Mary Jane was active in the
Home Demonstration Club (now FCE) and in the local and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">county</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st="on">PTA</st1:placename></st1:place>,
serving as president at both levels. The Gartons were officers and directors of
the Dickson County Farm Bureau. In the farmhouse, too, the Gartons began to
take advantage of new technology. The 1877 farmhouse underwent remodeling
beginning in 1951 when plumbing was installed. The modern kitchen was used as
an example by the U. T. Extension Service to illustrate how farm families could
remodel their homes to enjoy the conveniences that were becoming widely
available after World War II. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
















<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Almost
one hundred years after his great grandparents established the farm, Donald
Mark Garton became the owner of the farm in 1986. The original log barn,
incorporated into a larger barn by Mark Gorton, Jr. in the early 1900s, is
still used today for storing hay to feed cattle raised on the Garton Farm. Mr.
Garton is active in the local livestock association and served as president for
three years. He is also a director of the Tennessee Cattlemen&rsquo;s Association.
Mr. Garton&rsquo;s brother, Stanley, and his nephew, Kevin, also help on the family
farm as needed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

three children. In 1935 and 1936 his widow, Clara W. Stokes, and children,
William J. Stokes and Jennie Beth Stokes, acquired the property. The farm
products continued to be much the same throughout the twentieth century with
the addition of timber. In 1976, when the farm became one of the first
Tennessee Century Farms, Clara and William J. Stokes managed and operated the
farm where they raised tobacco and cattle. Today, William J. Stokes continues
to produce a tobacco crop, just as his grandfather did, on the farm founded
just before the start of the Civil War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dr.
Daniel Rook Leech was the next family owner, operating the farm until his death

</span>He and his wife, Mary Ann Mathis, had 12 children.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They produced a variety of farm products

and poultry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
















<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In
1911, W. B. Leech sold the farm to his cousin W. Wellington Larkins who made
substantial changes to the farm&rsquo;s landscape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He constructed an equipment shed and smokehouse in 1915.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following year he began work on a new
farmhouse which remains an important part of the farm today. The vernacular
house was designed and built by local craftsman &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; Allen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A stone fence enclosing the family cemetery
was erected and a turn of the century barn was moved south of the farmhouse
when the state improved and widened Highway 47 in the 1920s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To support the diverse farm operation,
several new outbuildings and a root cellar were added during the 1930s and
1940s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the death of W. Wellington Larkins in 1949, his daughter Elizabeth Larkins
DePriest purchased the shares of her siblings and began operating the farm
along with her husband James DePriest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. DePriest, described as a &ldquo;naturalist&rdquo; by her friends, is a tireless
advocate of land conservation as well as a keeper of family and community
history. She continues the daily management of the farm, though in 1988 she
conveyed 218 acres to her son J. Wellington DePriest, an engineer with
International Steel based in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over 70 acres of the Depriest Farm are in a

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Located near Cumberland Furnace is the Fiser-Jackson Farm that was
founded in 1900 by J. M. Jackson. The 104 acres produced corn, wheat and
tobacco. J. M. was married to Ada E. Jackson. In 1904, John F. Jackson, a
cousin, acquired the farm. A year later, the first known family house was built
on the property. Under John&rsquo;s ownership, swine were added to the farm&rsquo;s
operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John&rsquo;s daughter, Maymie
Baker and her husband Hershel Baker were the next owners of the land. In 1955,
the land was acquired by William Fiser, a great nephew of the founder. Married
to Mary Annie Fiser, the couple had two children. On the farm, they raised
corn, tobacco, cattle and hogs. Today, the farm is owned by Larry Dale Fiser
who, with his cousin Randy Simpkins, manages the farm operations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

challenge at best for farm families, but tragedy also visited the Millers when
five of their 15 children died in infancy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The parents and their surviving 7 sons and 3 daughters, &ldquo;surmounted
difficulties of Reconstruction through personal integrity and continuous
endeavor.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Progressive farmers, the
Millers engineers a water system that automatically brought water several
hundred yards for a cave spring for their household use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The farm was described as a &ldquo;model of
efficiency with use of numerous tools, planned water sheds, crop rotation, and
the use of natural fertilizers.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Millers regularly participated in community events and attended church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elizabeth Miller was an accomplished musician

economic panics deferred some of the family&rsquo;s plans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From 1910 to 1920, the Millers worked with
the county extension agent to implement soil conservation practices including
terracing the fields to prevent erosion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A concrete silo was built in 1913 that remained in use throughout the
twentieth century.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>State Highway 48 was
constructed through the farm beginning in 1929, and the acquisition of the
family&rsquo;s first motorized vehicles provided &ldquo;opportunities for broader social
and educational contacts&rdquo; along with improved farm to market options.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Millers opened a school in their home
for a time and furnished the teacher with room and board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they assisted the community with the

the past seventy years, generations of women have owned and managed Hickory

Elizabeth Miller Chapman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Successfully
managing the farm through the Great Depression as well as World War II, the
Miller Farm first received electrical power in 1941. Over the next six decades,
the farm produced fruits, corn, tobacco, vegetables, and sileage as well as
sheep, horses, and cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss Miller
and Mrs. Chapman applied for Century Farm certification of their family farm in
1985. At that time, Miss Miller indicated that the row crops were less
emphasized and the focus was on producing better beef cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today, the 250 acre farm continues to produce
tobacco, hay, and cattle and is the legal responsibility of owners Maria Miller

1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agnes, who was not raised on the
farm bur often visited her grandparents who lived there, explains that the land
was &ldquo;very run down when we bought it, and we had to reclaim the fields.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the years, fighting against erosion and
neglect, the Powells made &ldquo;every inch of the land tillable except the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Founded in 1787 by John Larkins of
North Carolina, this family farm is the oldest Century Farm in Dickson County
and ranks as the tenth oldest in the state. Located about 5 miles west of White
Bluff, Larkins, a Revolutionary War veteran and also the first Treasurer of
Dickson County, established the farm on 1000 acres about 5 miles west of where
the town of White Bluff is now located.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Married to Sarah McAdow, the Larkins had four sons who received shares
of the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>James Larkins inherited his
250 acres in 1805.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here he raised corn,
hay, wheat, and cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While his wife&rsquo;s
name is not known, their three children are identified as Calvin, Acie, and
Margaret. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

current owner L. D. Larkins, Jr., his great grandfather refused to sign a
document presented to him by Union soldiers stating he would not help the
Confederates. On hearing his reply, &ldquo;I help everybody,&rdquo; he was thrown in the <o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">icy creek and marched to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Charlotte</st1:city></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">By

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The property has been worked and

times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leslie D. Larkins, Sr., the fifth
generation owner, acquired 215 acres in 1940.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The elder Larkins and his son, L. D., Jr and his wife Jean nominated the
farm to be a Century Farm in 1976.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Today, the sixth and seventh generations of Larkins also live on the
farm where the family raises cattle, corn, wheat, and soybeans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is this a busy twenty-first century farm
family, but the Larkins appreciate and work to preserve their history and the
rural landscape which has been in their family longer than Tennessee has been a
state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">While many Century Farms owners trace
their lineage to the thousands of Scots-Irish immigrants that settled <st1:state w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:state>, the Miller family has roots in Saxony where
the founder A. E. C. Miller came from his home in <st1:city w:st="on">Gotha</st1:city>
to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:state></st1:place>
in 1837.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his wife Elizabeth Goin
married in 1851 and moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:state></st1:place>
with nine children in 1869.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Altogether
the Millers had a total of fifteen children, nine of whom survived to
adulthood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
















<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Millers
established a farm of 437 acres in 1881 on Old Highway 48 northwest of <st1:place style="font-family: Arial;" w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Charlotte</st1:city></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">, they
constructed distinctive buildings that reflected Germanic styles. The first
house built in 1881 housed animals on the first floor and had living quarters
for the family on the second floor as was often the case in Miller&rsquo;s native
country. A second dwelling was built in 1890 that also reflects Teutonic
origins. </span><o:p></o:p></span>













<br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A structure
unique to the Miller Farm is the water shed built in 1900 to store and supply
the house and farmyard with water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ground level was used to house chickens and store firewood while the upper
level contains the water storage tank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While water storage tanks are not uncommon to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:state></st1:place> farms, this building is one of a
kind.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span>













<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A Pennsylvania-Deutsche bank barn was
built in 1890 to take advantage of the natural topography.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first floor and loft are easily
accessible from the top of the rise while the ground floor is reached from the
fields below. Built as a hog barn, it has served many uses over the years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second barn built during the same period
for hay and mules also has elements that reflect the founder&rsquo;s ethnic
origins.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like most successful farmers,
the Millers have diversified their operations over the years to accommodate
changing markets and to take advantage of new and improved technology. Around
1900, the Millers added honeybees and sorghum cane to their inventory. Then
during the 1930s, production shifted to wheat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The family participated in federal conservation programs through the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to build terraces and dams in their fields to
curb the erosion of fertile topsoil and also to take advantage of
phosphate-based fertilizers. During the Great Depression, the Miller farm was a
demonstration farm for progressive farming methods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this time a variety of fruit trees
were added to the landscape. In the 1940s, the focus changed to dairy cattle
and a modern milking barn with three electric milking machines was built. The
farm continued to operate as a dairy until the 1980s when the shift to beef
cattle began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
















<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The founder A. E. C Miller transferred
the farm to two of his sons, A. L. Miller and V. B. Miller in 1888.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>V. A. Miller, son of A. L. Miller, received a
portion of the property in 1940 and purchased the remaining portion from heirs
in 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>James A. Miller, son of V. A.
Miller, has owned the property since 1979.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>His wife of many years Joyce and their children Debby and Mike continue
to be involved in the daily life of the farm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mike works with his father on the farm and Debby teaches at Charlotte
Elementary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Debby&rsquo;s daughter Leah
Stewart represents yet another generation who continues the traditions of hard
work and love of the land practiced by her Germanic ancestors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family&rsquo;s patriarch, James A. Miller,
continues to believe that &ldquo;If you take care of the land, it will take care of
you.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>log outbuildings dating to the early nineteenth century.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Neblett, a civil engineer was often

with her two sons, Herschel and John B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Like many farm women, she added to the much-needed cash income by
producing butter and eggs which she sold or bartered for items not produced on

walnuts from the many trees on the farm and sold them at the Charlotte Mercantile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the time John and his wife Augusta Tippit Neblett assumed ownership of the farm
in 1935, it covered nearly 200 acres.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Progressive farmers, the Nebletts terraced fields, constructed natural
wind breaks that also served as fencing, built a pond for livestock, and
practiced crop rotation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of
these successful methods, the farm was designated as an experimental farm by
the Agricultural Extension Service in 1940.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>New breeds of livestock, such as pure bred Herefords, Polled Herefords,
and <st1:place w:st="on">Shropshire</st1:place> sheep were raised along with
new and improved strains of tobacco and wheat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Nebletts believed in the &ldquo;Better Home, Better Farms&rdquo; philosophy and
modernized the main dwelling house taking advantage of new and improved

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Spring Forrest Farm is located four miles north of Highway 70W
and was established by John West in 1808. On 185 acres, the farm produced hay,
grain, tobacco and livestock. Married to Sarah West, the couple had eleven
children. Their eldest child, Susan West, married John Sanders and he acquired
the property in 1836. During his ownership, a new log cabin was built in the
front yard and the original dwelling was torn down. John lived and farmed the
property until his death in 1848. Susan continued to live in the house and run
the farm until her death in 1876. During the Civil War, three of their
sons,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John J., Thomas Berry and Henry G.
Sanders, fought for the Confederacy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Henry died in an <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Illinois</st1:place></st1:state>
prison camp.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>John was severely injured
in the Battle of Franklin, but survived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the war, John and Thomas Berry returned to the family home and
farmed together. By 1872, the farm was willed to John and Thomas Berry. In
1894, the brothers decided to split the farm into two tracts of approximately
200 acres each. Thomas Berry took the property lying on the west side and John
J. took the property on the east side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>








<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1908, one of Thomas&rsquo;s sons, Van. D. Sanders, acquired the farm.
According to the family, Van earned the money to purchase the land by working
in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:state>
as a telegraph lineman. Married to Stella Johnson, from a neighboring
family,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in 1910, the couple had two
sons, Harris Walker and Charles Lawrence Sanders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to farming, Van and Stella set up
a country store in one room of their house for the residents of the
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1930, Stella registered
the farm with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture as the &ldquo;Spring Forest
Farm.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1941, Harris and Lawrence
built a new home on the farm for their parents. The new home had modern conveniences
such as indoor plumbing, electricity and modern appliances. Although the new
home had many comfortable amenities, Van and Stella did not &ldquo;feel at home&rdquo; in
their new dwelling and so they moved back across the road to the comfortable
log home that they had known for many years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually, Harris and his family moved into the new house and he became
the sole owner of the farm. Harris was married to Geraldine Harris Sanders and
they had one son, Dan Harris Sanders.</span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After Harris&rsquo;s death, Dan, his wife Lois U. Sanders and their children,
Scott and Angela, assumed the responsibilities of the cattle and crops and
began a revitalization of the farm. Over the next twenty years, they built a
new home, renovated the original log home and barn and added new fences to the
farm. The ownership of the farm stayed with Geraldine Sanders until 1999 when
she transferred it to the Sanders Family Partnership LP. </span><span style="font-family: Palatino; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 2000, Angela (Angie) married Andrew
Thompson on the family farm and they now have two children, Andrew Harris and
Anna Elizabeth.</span><span style="font-family: Palatino; color: black;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In a statement on the history of the farm
prepared by Angie, she writes, &ldquo;The family members that make up the Sanders
Family Partnership plan to continue to operate and responsibly manage the farm
raising livestock, timber, and hay for many generations to come.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

native <st1:placename w:st="on">Dickson</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">County</st1:placetype>
after the Civil War, he purchased around 225 acres just south of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Charlotte</st1:city></st1:place> in January of
1866.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here he and his wife Permelia
Sanders, parents of six children, produced corn, tobacco, and livestock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1879 the Steeles donated land for a
building to house a community school and church. R. Sam Steele, their son,
inherited the farm in 1919.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continued
the family&rsquo;s contributions by serving as a county magistrate, Sunday School
superintendent, and also donated land for construction of a public school in
1924.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and wife Genie Donegan worked
to expand the farm to 501 acres where they raised tobacco, corn, hay, cattle,
and swine. Another &ldquo;charter&rdquo; Century Farm, the Steele Farm was certified in
1976 for owners Glen, John, and David Steele who acquired the property in 1973.

century is described by the family as a &ldquo;fully functioning farm&rdquo; and is
fortunate to have several generations involved in the operations and enjoyment
of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John D. Steele and
Lizzie Steele Shelton are the surviving grandchildren of the founders, and
share in the ownership of the farm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alice Steele, 92-year-old widow of Glen D. Steele, continues to manage a
small herd of beef cattle and the hay crop on her acreage. Alice and Glen&rsquo;s
children, Janelle S. Turner, Glen T., and David are also part owners of the
farm.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David received a degree in
agriculture from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype>

free of huge doses of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">antibiotics often administered
through feed, and the herds graze on pastures rather than being confined to
large stock barns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other owners of
portions of the farm are Sara Jean Russell and Nancy Russell Alexander,
daughter and granddaughter of Lizzie, and Ellie Turner Tucker. Jamin Turner, at
the age of eight, represents the sixth generation of his family to live on the
farm where a tradition is to gather each spring for a &ldquo;dogwood&rdquo; ride around the
farm to view the many trees and gather blossoms.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the year that it took to complete the substantial house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Suggs operated a sawmill during this time

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">On 188 acres, Samuel and his wife Jeraldine Mitchell raised cows, chickens
and corn. The couple had seven children and their son, Marcus Claiborne Gilmore
became the second generation to own the farm.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

just outside of Vanleer, and she was studying to be a teacher.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The family has letters that passed between
Marcus and Julia during this time that tell much about the family and their
activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they married, the
couple constructed a two-story white clapboard house with a stone fireplace
overlooking the spring on Bear Creek. In 1904, Marcus began to build a barn for
the farm, but died suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julia, who
was pregnant at the time, was left with two small daughters and a large farm
with crops and livestock. Despite the difficulties, Julia was a resourceful
woman whomanaged the farm, raised her three children, and looked after her
elderly mother-in-law and handicapped brother-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To support herself and her children, she sold
eggs, chickens, rented out the mill, and raised corn and cattle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her son, who was born two months after his father&rsquo;s sudden death,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bought out his sisters and became the sole
owner of the farm. Along with his wife Dorothy Winona Spradlin Gilmore, the
couple and their son, Clayborn David, raised cows, chickens, corn, hay, horses,
mules, pigs, tobacco, cotton and vegetables.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1968, Clayborn David Gilmore, the
great grandson of the founder, acquired the land. In addition to managing the
farm, David was a teacher and a principal in the county school system. Until
his father died in 1979, the two farmed together and raised cows, hogs, sheep
and chickens. They also cultivated tobacco, hay, corn and many assorted
vegetables. David and Peggy Ann Milam married in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have two children, Keith and Karla.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today, David is retired from the Dickson
County Board of Education, but he continues to raise cows, hay, corn, tobacco
and a wide variety of vegetables. A farm house and a log barn that was built in
the 1900s, as well as a stock barn, a corn crib and a tobacco barn constructed
in the 1930s and 1940s are some of the buildings in the farm complex.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
