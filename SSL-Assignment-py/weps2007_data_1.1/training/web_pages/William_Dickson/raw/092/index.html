<p>The more enlightened proprietors, who knew the island from
experience or who lived in the midst of their people, better
understood the daily detail of pen and plantation life and were more
likely to be of similar mind to John Shand. In 1815 he had written to
George Watson-Taylor, whose properties he managed, to advise: 
</P>

<P>... you may rely that such care shall be taken that the negroes shall have 
  abundance of food and every other assistance. I consider their preservation 
  and comfort to be the first object on every well regulated estate ... (Note150)</P>
<P><font size="-1">Note 150: Institute of Commonwealth Studies: Simon Taylor archive 
  (Taylor VIII B 5).</font></P>
<P>Watson-Taylor, who was soon to inherit <I>Haughton Court</I> plantation at 
  Lucea, was fortunate in his estate attorney. Well regulated though his properties 
  might have been, others were not and instances of casual carelessness and individual 
  brutality in breach of the law did not always escape the attention of the authorities 
  and the press. As late as 1822, Charles Newman, a proprietor, was charged with 
  murder, having violently beaten to death a slave pinned in the stocks, despite 
  remonstrations from onlookers who were, nevertheless, loath to intervene more 
  directly between a man and his property.</P>
<P> His acquittal at a subsequent trial was reported to London, by the governor, 
  as owing to the &lsquo;scandalous neglect and ignorance of the magistrates &quot;who 
  were derelict in their duty to dispense justice&quot;. (Note151) </P>


<P><font size="-1">Note 151: National Archives: Governor Conran to Lord Bathurst, 
  8 and 22 March 1822, CO 137/153.</font></p>
<P>Some attorneys and subordinates running estates for owners living abroad ever 
  had an eye only on the balance sheet and the calibre of overseers and book keepers, 
  who organised a plantation's work, was often less than mediocre at best. On 
  his return to the island in 1800 George Malcolm had lamented that the situation 
  &hellip;and the condition of &hellip;negroes and stock and want of provisions 
  were concealed from me and every thing is in a most shocking neglected situation&quot;.&rdquo; 
  (Note152) The following year, brother Neill wrote to insist &quot;how much the 
  prosperity of estates depends on the proper choice of overseers&quot;. It is 
  also clear from this letter that his habit was to interview personally the young 
  men at home who offered to fill these positions and who perhaps had ambition 
  to follow business of their own having had an introduction to the island; it 
  was also his habit to reject those he did not approve of. The jaundiced view 
  of some of these newly-arrived middle men who were not similarly vetted did 
  little to ease matters.</p>

<p><font size="-1">Note 152: George Malcolm to Neill Malcolm, 15 Oct. 1800.</font></p>

<p>... I have resided nearly four years in the humble capacity of a book keeper 
  in this isle, and am all day in the midst of the negroes &hellip; I have had 
  every means of studying their character and dispositions &hellip; They are a 
  race of beings who cannot bear prosperity ... It will be a lapse of ages before 
  the negroes can even participate of the blessings of freedom, the very name 
  African must cease to exist in their memories before their customs are obliterated 
  ... (Note153)</p>

<p> <font size="-1">Note 153: National Archives: CO 137/155, April 1823</font></p>

<p>G. T. Gilbert's letter to the Colonial Office in 1823 convinced no one there 
  at the time, coming as it did from a newcomer in &quot;an inferior condition 
  in life&quot; (Note154) with little experience of the place and with equally 
  little commitment to it.</p>

<p><font size="-1">Note154: Governor Manchester on the status of overseers and 
  book-keepers.</font></p>
<p> He certainly did not represent the view of those who knew the island well, 
  including some absentees, and who understood the need for a long term and more 
  phlegmatic approach. </p>


<p>Success in Sugar, that most uncertain production upon the face of the earth 
  (Note155), called for care, patience and pragmatism or, as Neill Malcolm put 
  it, &quot;planters like farmers must ever be full of anxiety and they ought 
  to be philosophers and prepared for disappointments. (Note156) </p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 155: William Beckford: <b>A Descriptive Account of the 
  Island of Jamaica</b>, Vol. 2.</font></p>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 156: Neill Malcolm to George Malcolm, 3 Oct. 1801.</font></p>




<p>Total disappointment, however, could be avoided with a little foresight.</p>


<H1>To them and their heirs</H1>
<P>There is no telling what hopes John Dickson may have had for his
heirs in Jamaica. Death arrived unexpectedly, his surviving sons were
young, there was no hint at the time of a generation beyond them and
although the eldest, John, would later find a wife the pair left no
surviving children. The dearth of eligible white women on the island
may have been compounded by the scars of childhood smallpox and a
relatively small holding to preclude his brothers William and Richard
from marriage, or maybe they shared the opinion of Major Frederick
Johnston who had written to his wife in 1794 that:</P>
<P>the English Mulatto women are the handsomest, they have all the finest teeth 
  I ever saw and they take a great deal of care of them, cleaning them twice a 
  day with Tamarin wood, indeed I am sorry to say that all together they are more 
  cleanly than my fair Country Women. I can assure you the English women that 
  are here are quite Nasty to look at. They give one the idea of a person that 
  has been buried and risen again. It is quite the fashion for everybody ... to 
  have one of these princesses to live with them as house keepers or Nurses ... 
  &hellip;for I am given to understand that unless you are taken care of by them 
  you must die for as soon as you are ill all your friends desert you for fear 
  of infection ... (Note157)</p>

  2, March 1959: <i>Military Sidelights of the 1790s</i>, Carson I. A. Ritchie. 
  [Johnston survived the abortive military campaign on St. Domingue (Haiti), returned 
  with the remnants of his disease-culled regiment to Jamaica and eventually arrived 
  back in England].</font></p>

<p>However, Dickson senior did have grandchildren and an extended Creole - Jamaica 
  born - family was to grow up on Davis' Cove's easterly shore and in Lucea over 
  the coming years. Richard Dickson certainly had heirs, by Fanny Fraser, his 
  mulatto housekeeper, and by others, and in this he was not alone: Dugald Malcolm 
  (<I>Pell River</I>), Dugald Campbell (<I>Salt Spring</I>), Duncan Campbell <I>[Morven</I>], 
  George Malcolm and his son John (<I>Argyle</I>), Donald Malcolm (<I>Alexandria</I>) 
  and Archibald Campbell (<I>Askenish</I>) all acknowledged such children and 
  set aside an inheritance for them.<SUP> </SUP>These men were just a few of the 
  many widowers and bachelors in the parish who looked for female companionship 
  that was not &quot;nasty to look at&quot; and Dickson's cousin, William, followed 
  suit soon after his arrival in Hanover.<SUP> </SUP> </p>

<P>As to business, by 1816 Dickson &amp; Co. Merchants, were now established with 
  a wharf in Lucea in addition to the cove wharf and the plantation, the latter 
  still carefully separated. Richard Dickson, his natural sons John, Richard and 
  William Fraser, the three brothers being &quot;free people of colour&quot;, 
  and William Augustus were party to the company. Dickson's death in January 1821, 
  after attending his first and last session as a member of the Assembly in the 
  autumn of the previous year, was announced in the Royal Gazette of Jamaica; 
  curiously, it was also noted some months later in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> 
  (Note158), an Edinburgh publication, even though he had inherited no interests 
  in Scotland.</P>

<P>... and I hereby nominate and appoint the said <I>William Augustus Dickson</I>

  of this my last will and Testament ... (Note160)</p>

<p> <font size="-1">Note 160: Island Record Office, Jamaica, will of Richard Dickson</font></p>
<p>Some might have wondered why the <I>Cousins Cove</I> estate was left to Dickson's 
  cousin rather than to his own sons. Slave ownership was not at issue as any 
  &quot;person of free condition&quot;, of whatever origin and who had the means, 
  could possess slaves and many did as a matter of course. Dickson's own children 
  inherited some fifty all told and Dugald Malcolm had instructed his executors 
  (Note161), in 1785, that a free mulatto man named Alexander, a carpenter, and 
  a mulatto woman named Elsy should be given &pound;140 each &quot;to be laid 
  out in the purchase of one or more Negro or Negroes&quot;; although Campbell 
  was not explicit, both were presumably his children. The restriction against 
  a free person of colour &lsquo;acquiring property by devise beyond a certain 
  limit&rdquo; (Note162) had been removed by the Assembly five years earlier, 
  a matter welcomed by the island's governor who wrote to London that &quot;it 
  would attach them more strongly to &hellip;a country in which they now possess 
  an increased interest&quot;. (Note163)</P>
<p><font size="-1">Note 161: National Archives, PCC will of Dugald Malcolm.</font></P>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 162: National Archives, CO137/136, Governor Manchester 
  to Lord Bathurst, 10 Dec. 1813.</font></p>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 163: <i>Ibid.</i></font></p>



<p>That the seemingly greater part of the bequest should be left to a Scottish-born 
  relative was determined not by any greater or lesser affection on Dickson's 
  part but by a pragmatic view of the future for his children and grandchildren. 
  The wharf and its trade, returning steady money for more than forty years and 
  unfettered by any mortgage, which was now shifted upon a part of the plantation 
  lands, was the more reliable business altogether and the more enduring prospect 
  for his sons. <I>Cousins Cove</I> estate, although potentially more profitable, 
  had been in Dickson's hands for only nine years and carried with it the usual 
  risks and expenses common to planting, particularly at this time with prices 
  in general decline and costs rising; circumstances were rather less certain 
  than during his father's early years on the island, when Patrick Browne had 
  noted that Jamaican planters, even then:</P>
<P>... though rich and easy in circumstances, are seldom out of debt; for the 
  charges attending a sugar settlement are very considerable and constant; the 
  interest of money very high and their natural propensity to increase their possessions 
  constantly engaging them in new disbursements and contracts ... (Note164)</P>
<P><font size="-1">Note 164: Patrick Browne, <b>The Civil and Natural History 
  of Jamaica</b>, 1756, Vol. 1.</font></p>
<P>Although now a planter, Dickson's cousin William at least had the support of 
  trade at the Lucea wharf in reserve, if needed, to avoid the constant charges 
  and debts that Browne clearly saw as potentially ruinous if allowed to swell 
  uncontrolled.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that Richard Dickson's increase in possessions had rather 
  more to do with political ambition than any thought of &quot;easy circumstances&quot; 
  from a lucrative return; ownership of <I>Cousins Cove</I> provided the status 
  and substance to put up for election to the House of Assembly. It may also be 
  that Dickson, living on the island, demanded rather less from an estate that 
  was also his home than did owners who lived abroad and to whom one plantation 
  or another represented only commercial worth. George Hibbert, who owned a share 
  in <I>Haddington</I> and <I>Welcome</I> and whose brother and cousin also had 
  estates in Hanover (Note165), had brooded over the diminishing returns of his 
  Jamaican properties only two years before Dickson's death. </p>

<p><font size="-1">Note 165: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1819: Hibberts and Taylor 
  owned <i>Haddington </i>and <i>Welcome</i>, Robert Hibbert <i>Great Valley</i> 
  and Robert Hibbert Junior, <i>Georgia</i>.</font></P>
<p>At home in Clapham he complained to his diary on 6<SUP>th</SUP> November 1819 
  that:</P>
<P>the turn which our commercial affairs have lately been taking is
of a most unpromising aspect, the Prices of Produce are so fallen as
to affect the nett Proceeds nearly 80 per cent, and the consequence
is, as the expences do not diminish, that the Planter gets hardly
anything and the Merchant very little. (Note166)</p>

<p> <font size="-1">Note 166: From <b>Caribbeana</b>, Vol. 4: extract from George 
  Hibbert's diary.</font></p>

<p>Although a little more cheered by his &pound;18,000 share from the recent sale 
  of <I>Dumfries</I> plantation in the neighbouring parish of St. James, Hibbert 
  was surprised that William Fairclough, had been &quot;bold enough to give &pound;30,100 
  currency&quot; for it. (Note167)</P>
<p><font size="-1">Note 167: Re Currency: i.e. Jamaican; &pound;100 Sterling approximated 
  to &pound;166 Jamaican.</font></p>
    <p></p><table dir="ltr" align="right" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1"><tr><td valign="top">

	</tr><tr><td></td>	</tr></table><p></p>
<p> However, as with Dickson, the island was Fairclough's home and his affairs 
  involved more than agriculture: he had long been a director of the Falmouth 
  Water Company (Note 168) which, as well as supplying the town, levied a rate 
  of 6d. per ton &quot;gross registry&quot; on ships entering port, whether re-victualling 
  with water or not (Note169); he was attorney and trustee of <I>Deans Valley</I> 
  estate in Westmoreland and although he owned <I>Catadupa</I> (Note170) in partnership 
  with James Hedley - it was a coffee plantation with a small cattle pen in St. 
  James - <I>Dumfries</I> was his alone.</P>
<p><font size="-1">Note 168: <b>Jamaica Almana</b>c, 1802</font></P>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 169: <b>History of the Parish of Trelawny</b> by Daniel 
  L. Ogilvie. Vessels under 25 tons were exempt.</font></p>
<p> Like Dickson, he too was elected to the Assembly a few years after acquiring 
  his estate. Hibbert perhaps underestimated the value that many island landowners 
  attached to their estates over and above a financial return, not that they lacked 
  commercial sense or enterprise. Being on the spot they were able to provide 
  the &quot;attention in every department&quot; so valued by Neill Malcolm. </P>
<P>For Dickson to have had <I>Cousin's Cove</I> parcelled into several smaller 
  holdings on his death, for a seemingly more equal distribution of its value 
  among his extended family, would have reduced its future value as a family asset 
  and William Augustus was, after all, cousin and business partner to his sons. 
  Possession of the estate in William Dickson's name, however, meant that he now 
  had the status and substance to make a &quot;good&quot; marriage, if he could; 
  he did so a year later, at <I>Kew</I> house (Note171), where he married Ann 
  Robina Brown. She, now 23, was the youngest daughter of William Brown, lately 
  of <I>Kew</I> who had been a close acquaintance of Richard's father, John Dickson. 
  Ann's widowed mother, Mary, joined her daughter and son-in-law at <I>Dry Hill</I>, 
  <I>Davis's Cove,</I> perhaps to keep an eye on William, now 36, who already 
  acknowledged four children, though not by a previous marriage; these children 
  lived in the town, Lucea, while the majority of the extended family and dependents 
  was gathered around the house at the cove.</p>
<P> All except William Augustus were Creole and a third generation was growing 
  up there for Richard Dickson's eldest son, John, was already married with three 
  children. As an independent man of some property and means, he was also taking 
  on civic duties, now open to &quot;persons of his class&quot;, no doubt with 
  a little help from his cousins William Dickson and John Malcolm (Note172) both 
  of whom were magistrates. Magistrates too, within a few years, were merchant 
  John Napier Dawes and George Johnson (Note173), both quadroons like John Dickson. 
  This pattern of Creole kinship, commerce and inheritance was being repeated 
  in other families, becoming more familiar and is clearly seen in a detailed 
  census return of 1823 unique to the parish. (Note174) Although there appear 
  to be some notable omissions these may be explained by absence from the parish 
  on other affairs at the time.</p>

<p> In 1788 this had stood at 812 &quot;White&quot; to 150 &quot;Brown&quot;; 
  by 1823 the balance had quite reversed and the corresponding numbers were 502 
  and 936. Second and third generation heirs of merchants who had &quot;not such 
  an affection for the country as to wish to remain in it&quot; ... (Note176) 
  had retired to the British Isles or followed business and other careers abroad; 
  those who had developed family ties and affections remained.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 176: 1767, Dugald Malcolm to his father.</font></p>
<p> Some of these extended families lived together whilst others were dispersing, 
  not far away, to live independently on smaller holdings parcelled out of estate 
  lands or in town houses at Lucea or Green Island. One hundred and ninety three 
  named properties, both small and large, appeared on the parish record of givings-in 
  for the March quarter of 1823. (Note177) Of these, some eighty were large enough 
  to be called &quot;estates&quot; and they employed just three quarters of the 
  parish's slaves. The rest were as widespread as their owners.</p>

<p>If the strength of Campbell influence in 18th century Hanover had resided around 
  Green Island and Orange Bay it had since drifted: the <I>Orange Bay</I> estate 
  was now in the hands of John Blagrove and managed by attorneys; <I>Fish River</I> 
  was no longer occupied by a Campbell owner (Note178) but managed for Peter's 
  heirs while <I>Salt Spring</I> was also in the hands of attorneys for Dugald's 
  heirs; although twenty-year-old Archibald Campbell lived at <I>Salt Spring</I>, 
  he remains untraced. Elsewhere, however, Alexander Campbell at <I>Copse</I>, 
  now 53 and settled there with his son Alexander (aged 3) by Sarah Davillas, 
  a mustee woman twenty seven years his junior, was colonel of the militia and 
  a Justice of the peace; his namesake, merchant at Lucea, occupied the family 
  house at <I>Thorn Hill</I> and was also a J.P. (Note179)</p>

<H3>Merit of necessity</H3>
<P>On 12th June 1824, Alexander Campbell was at home on
<i>Copse</i> estate in the east of the parish, near the Great River,
but his usual morning routine was disturbed by a messenger with
alarming news of trouble at plantations several miles away. As
colonel of the Hanover militia, Campbell later reported in evidence:</P>
<P>I received a despatch from Mr. Malcolm (Note180) &hellip; about half past ten 
  o'clock in the day, upon which I ordered out the whole regiment. I despatched 
  three of my own servants and the book-keeper ordering them to muster at Argyle. 
  I kept all the regiment that had assembled on guard that night &hellip;most 
  of the negroes were armed with machetes. The last man that was taken had been 
  seen frequently with a gun; I know all but one of the prisoners &hellip;most 
  of them came in the dress of Dugald Campbell (Note181), viz.. blue cotton jacket 
  and trousers ... (Note182)</P>
<P><font size="-1">Note 180: John Malcolm, at Argyle, son of George Malcolm by 
  Sarah Crooks. Malcolm was forewarned about action due to start the following 
  day, a Saturday.</font></P>
<P><font size="-1">Note 181: There was no Dugald Campbell owning slaves in Hanover 
  at this time. The name probably refers to the late Dugald Campbell [d. 1813] 
  of <i>Salt Spring</i> which was listed in the Jamaica Almanac as belonging to 
  his heirs.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1">Note 182: Royal Gazette of Jamaica, 24th July 1824. Campbell's 
  evidence to the court at Lucea.</font></p>


<P>Although the disturbances were quelled with the usual despatch, the call out 
  of the militia, which included all free males, the subsequent trials at Lucea 
  Court House and the often dignified defiance of those condemned to die perhaps 
  forewarned of further troubles ahead, for those who were prepared to put a mind 
  to the future. On the way out to his execution:</P>
<P>one of the rebels observed to one of the Militia that he had better take care 
  of his red coat as he would soon have enough to do with it. (Note183)</p>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 183: Royal Gazette of Jamaica, report of executions on 
  19 July 1824</font></p>

<p>Another declared that &quot;the war had only just begun&quot; and even John 
  Malcolm, &quot;who was yet most kind and indulgent&quot; (Note184), had seen 
  some of his people at <I>Argyle</I> estate take part in the doomed affair and 
  suffer for it. Poignantly, those condemned asked to speak to Malcolm before 
  their execution and, in a meeting which must have been strained for all the 
  parties, begged forgiveness of their Master, which was granted. (Note185)</p>

  Manchester to Lord Bathurst, 23 July 1824: reported comment of a slave prior 
  to execution. </font></p>
<p> Contemporary reports reveal that the intended rebellion was born of frustration 
  and the desire of those involved to order their own affairs. John Clarke, one 
  of the leaders at <I>Argyle</I>, was a man of some means for one in his situation, 
  having &quot;three provision grounds, a ginger piece, two good cows, and an 
  abundance of pigs and poultry&quot;. (Note186) He killed himself soon after 
  his arrest rather than face trial, as did two others from <I>Argyle</I>, and 
  it was, perhaps, determination such as this which left a more lasting impression 
  amongst supporters and opponents alike. The official view was that the affair 
  had resulted from &quot;the delusion which the negroes throughout the Island 
  have generally participated in that they are entitled to their freedom&quot;. 
  (Note187) following erroneous reports of proceedings in Parliament.</p>

<p>While the island faced an uncertain future on several fronts, with an undercurrent 
  of political, social and economic change picking up pace and rippling the surface, 
  it may well have been this slave rebellion, which finally prompted a change 
  at the Dicksons' coves. William Dickson may have tired equally of the responsibility 
  for a plantation, found the work and the risk disagreeable or feared that it 
  would eventually &quot;prove a pickpocket&quot;. Whatever the reason or combination 
  of reasons for a new direction, a surveyor was commissioned to set out a plan 
  of the Cousins Cove estate. </p>
<p>The task was done and drawn up by the year's end (Note188) and, within twelve 
  months, Neill McCallum, a distant cousin to the Malcolms, (Note189) took up 
  the plantation, complete with livestock and slaves; if he was finally persuaded 
  by the rising price of sugar at the time, after some ten years of general decline, 
  he would soon discover that this had peaked as a result of reduced production, 
  and would slide again. Dickson's Wharf, the small family settlement and the 
  land at <I>Davis's Cove</I> were kept back and business there re-organised under 
  the name of &quot;William A. Dickson&quot;.</p>
<p> Having bought the land and buildings from his cousins, who still retained 
  their interests in the actual trade, William Augustus headed affairs at the 
  wharf, while John Dickson and his brothers now pursued business in Lucea. Both 
  sides of the family quietly continued to add to the their numbers and looked 
  to expand trade for the remainder of the decade. In hindsight, events were to 
  prove the change a wise one. With war time rates of taxation unreformed and 
  still creaming off the proceeds from crops - sugar in particular - landowners 
  who tried to meet &quot;contingent charges&quot; from the sale of surplus livestock, 
  as Neill Malcolm had aimed to do a quarter of a century before, found that support 
  dwindling fast.</p>

  cousin of the Jamaica Malcolms, the relationship has not been explored here.</font></p>
<p> In the three years between 1824 and 1827, the number of non-working stock 
  in the parish had fallen by some 10,000 beasts, well over half (Note190), most 
  of the remainder were concentrated on the large breeding pens or scattered amongst 
  the numerous smallholdings. </p>

<p><font size="-1">Note 190: Figures from the <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>: 1824 , 18, 
  281, 1827, 8, 630. the greatest reduction, 9,000, was between 1825 and 1827.</font></p>
<p>Witnessing the &quot;extensive and destructive insurrection amongst the slaves 
  in the Western Districts (Note191) at the turn of the year 1831, during which 
  many large properties were burned, might have occasioned the Dickson cousins 
  some sense of relief; not that they would have suffered immediate material loss, 
  for incendiary action did not reach Lucea nor <I>Cousins Cove</I> and the far 
  western estates.</p>

<p> Direct involvement, however, was unavoidable; as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 
  militia foot (Note192), William Augustus had an active part in the restoration 
  of order; active too, as a magistrate, was his participation in the resultant 
  trials of those rebel slaves who were tried at Lucea and the sentencing of those 
  found guilty. In keeping with contemporary practice in England, some of the 
  convicted in the neighbouring parish of St. James, from where the action had 
  spread, were transported for life, as before, the final destination this time 
  though was Australia. (Note193)</P>

<p> What Dickson had avoided, however, was a larger burden of the consequences, 
  a prompt and large increase in taxation on slave ownership aimed at raising 
  revenue to cover the loss and expense occasioned by the rebellion. The damage 
  in Hanover alone was estimated at around &pound;395,000 and:</P>
<P>... It will, doubtless, be concluded, that this enormous amount was to be raised 
  by additional taxes on those who had been already sufferers to a dreadful extent. 
  The house of assembly, however, almost to a man, proprietors themselves, knew 
  the sum <I>must</I> be raised, and they did not hesitate heavily to augment 
  the island taxes: that rate per head, for instance, on slaves, which had heretofore 
  annually been fixed at 5s. 10d. or 6s. 8d. at farthest, was now augmented to 
  8s. 4d. and that on stock to 2s. 1d., which generally had hitherto been 10d. 
  per head. Thus was one lamentable calamity succeeded by another most grievous 
  burthen, and to be borne by the ruined proprietors ... (Note194)</p>

<p>Despite yet more relief voted by Parliament (Note195), the rebellion's aftermath 
  would see the beginning of a slow slide to further debt for some. </p>


<p><font size="-1">Note 195: A total loan of &pound;200,000 was made available 
  to distressed planters.</font></p>
<p>Of straitened proprietors, Dickson had personal experience, as an estate attorney 
  for the <I>Caldwell</I> plantation in the Green Island area and as trustee in 
  the will of Benjamin Capon, its owner who also owned <I>Saxham</I> nearby. Capon 
  lived in the neighbouring parish of Westmoreland and after his death in 1829 
  Dickson had to wind up affairs complicated by various creditors in both Jamaica 
  and London and by anxious legatees pressing their claims. Further borrowing 
  against the plantation, by Dickson (Note196) after Capon's death, only delayed 
  matters which became even more strained by the additional tax burden that followed 
  the rebellion.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 196: N.A.: Slave compensation counter claims [T71/1212]. 
  In 1830, from Alexander Stewart (together with one Isaac Westmoreland) merchants

  been the same Alex. Stewart, or a relative, to whom Richard Dickson had once 
  mortgaged his Davis's Cove property.</font></p>
<p> Money was raised by the sale of both <I>Caldwell </I>and <I>Saxham</I>, at 
  a reduced valuation, to Anthony Davis, in 1832, but it was not enough to meet 
  outstanding demands amounting to some &pound;14,000 and a final settlement had 
  to await the outcome of slave compensation. With slavery abolished and the Government 
  in Britain paying per capita compensation to slave owners for the loss of property, 
  their value was added to Capon's estate but it was immediately subject to counter 
  claim by those who already had chancery judgements in their favour. (Note 197) 
</p>


<p> <font size="-1">Note 197: Other creditors were: David Marine, London merchant;

<P>Following the events of 1832 and with property destroyed, those
with lesser ties to the island and who could afford to do so: 
</P>


<P>... collected all they could, and repaired either to England or to America, 
  to commence the world again with what little funds they then possessed, leaving 
  their landed interests in the hands of such as, from being otherwise situated, 
  felt either inclined to continue in the country, or were compelled to make a 
  merit of necessity, by remaining to bear the brunt of whatever might be the 
  result of the late disastrous proceedings ... (Note198)</p>
<p> <font size="-1">Note 198: <i>Ibid.</i></font></p>

<p>For those who remained, however, there were pickings to be taken, and at a 
  lesser cost then before, particularly so as the value of many mortgage-encumbered 
  estates fell substantially during the years following emancipation. Those who 
  had borrowed large lost large and while some plantations were parcelled up for 
  sale in lots, or exchanged hands for a fraction of their former value, others 
  became quite unsaleable and were simply abandoned (Note199), the works falling 
  into disrepair. </P>
<p><font size="-1">Note 199: <b>Jamaica in 1850</b> by John Bigelow (1851).</font></P>
<p>By 1839 William Dickson was possessed of a small parcel of land in the neighbouring 
  parish of St. James, <I>Bellevue </I>(Note200), which had previously belonged 
  to the Bernard family. (Note201) Already installed there, since 1830, was Dickson's 
  niece by marriage, Anna Palmer, the daughter of his wife's elder sister who 
  was only four years younger than her aunt. Anna's husband John Palmer, of <I>Rose 
  Hall</I> and <I>Palmyra</I>, both in St. James, was yet another impecunious 
  planter who had died (1827) heavily indebted and with only &pound;1,137 to his 
  name, although the house at <I>Rose Hall</I> was particularly fine. His widow, 
  whose mother and stepfather were also now dead, had to rely on relatives for 
  support. Although Palmer's problems had come to a head before the &quot;late 
  disastrous proceedings&quot;, his wife's situation was a salutary reminder of 
  the &quot;vicissitudes of life&quot; amidst the tangles of debt. As to Dickson's 
  own affairs, these had grown some for with plantation ownership behind him, 
  he left a fair legacy when he too died in 1842.</P>

<p>Joseph, John and Wilhelmina were the surviving children of William Augustus 
  (Note203) born before he married and who still lived in Hanover; the property 
  in Lasswade was that which his mother had bought in trust for her children and 
  in which he had inherited a share; the wharf at Lucea had been the Grant's Wharf 
  of William Bligh's day and the acquisition of the wharves at Green Island - 
  once belonging to Donald Malcolm and Boyd Reid - was, perhaps, as much of a 
  nod to his great uncle, &quot;John of Salem&quot;, as it was a commercial proposition.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 203: Hanover Parish Register, 1725-1825.</font></p>
<p> The business, Wm. A. Dickson, had a footing in each of the main harbours of 
  the north west corner of the island. Whether this triple presence would prove 
  sustainable remained to be seen for the unexpected always waited to surprise, 
  even the wary. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<H1>An impoverished community</H1>


<P>As Hanover landowners, the Malcolm brothers had straddled two worlds - sometime 
  residents sometime absentees - with both success and disappointment. There was 
  also advantage and disadvantage in the number of estates they held: the strong 
  supported the weak and kept the whole viable but none could expect full attention 
  to detail, even by trusted attorneys, when an owner was abroad. George, on his 
  return to Hanover in 1800, had &quot;found <I>Knockalva Pen</I> very foul indeed 
  &hellip;little work done by the negroes&quot; and his early, brief visits to 
  <I>Argyle</I> plantation and its neighbouring pen he candidly admits were ineffectual. 
  Neill, writing from Scotland a year later, considered the <I>Retrieves</I> &quot;the 
  only estates that have continued to give &hellip;support&quot;. If these Malcolm 
  properties had returned such mixed results at that time, the situation for their 
  successors (Note204) was little different half a century later, although the 
  balance of fortune amongst them had changed. John Candler (Note205), Englishman 
  and Quaker visiting the island in 1850, recorded in his journal on 13th May 
  that he had met:</p>
  
  
<p> <font size="-1">Note 204: Jamaica Almanacs, 1830-1845: Neill Malcolm, son 
  of John, and now back in London, had inherited Argyle from his father. <i>New 
  Retrieve</i>, <i>Old Retrieve</i>, <i>Knockalva</i>, <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Pell 
  River</i>, <i>New Paradise</i>, <i>Blenheim</i>, and <i>Retirement</i> were 
  owned by his cousin, also Neill.</font></p>

  March 1959. John Candler kept a journal of visits Jamaica and North America 
  in 1840 and again in 1850. The original is held in London by The Friends Historical 
  Society. </font></p>


<P>Thomas Edwards the resident manager of <I>Knockalva Penn</I> which yields a 
  profit of from &pound;1,100 to &pound;1,500 pr annum for Neill Malcolm its absentee 
  owner. He is also attorney for two sugar estates belonging to the same proprietor. 
  One of them called <I>New Retrieve</I> has long been unprofitable, and it is 
  about to be abandoned as a sugar estate and turned to other uses. <I>Argyle</I> 
  Estate has been wretchedly managed and has proved a losing concern but is now 
  on course of being restored to fertility. It has made 136 hhds of sugar from 
  16 acres of cane besides 100 puncheons of rum and yielded a profit of &pound;1000.</P>
<P>With the cost of labour now negotiated and with preferential duty for exports 
  to Britain removed in 1846, there was a difference in solution to the old problem 
  of turning a profit; it was, however, not entirely new. The large and established 
  pen at <I>Knockalva</I> set the example for the &quot;other uses&quot; decided 
  upon at <I>New Retrieve</I> were cattle. While <I>Argyle</I> may have made money 
  in 1849, its consistency could not be assured and it too would become a cattle 
  pen. On the other six Malcolm estates in Hanover, whether they later remained 
  in family hands or not, sugar was gradually abandoned and the fields turned 
  to pasture for livestock. The same plan was later adopted at <I>Bogue</I> plantation, 
  yet another Malcolm estate in neighbouring St. James, which Candler noted had 
  &quot;occasioned a large loss lately to its owner&quot;. (Note206)</p>

<p> <font size="-1">Note 206: John Candler Journal, 7 May 1850.</font></p>


<p>For Hanover, and for Jamaica, there was a darker aspect to events in 1850. 
  One view of the situation facing the island at the time was that summarised 
  by the proprietors, merchants and mortgagers on the West India Committee in 
  February, 1851. Although absentee owners of active estates (Note207) had dwindled 
  in number, with a corresponding erosion of their once formidable influence, 
  they felt obliged to register a continuing concern for their interests on an 
  island overshadowed by death during a widespread epidemic which broke out about 
  the time that John Candler left the island to continue his travels in North 
  America.</p>





<P>seeing the ravages committed by the cholera, we are persuaded that
it is of vital importance to all the interests of the colony that
every effort should forthwith be made to obtain an accession of
labour to supply the great deficiency which that direful visitation
has so suddenly occasioned. It seems impossible to expect that even
the limited cultivation now existing can be now maintained; and if it
should decline the necessary expenditure for the institutions of
government, the administration of justice and for public instruction,
must fall more heavily than ever upon an impoverished community&hellip;upon
the success of its agriculture must almost wholly depend the success
of its commerce and with these are indissolubly connected every
subordinate pursuit and employment. (Note208)</p>

<p>The &quot;dreadful consternation&quot; caused by the disease which &quot;clung 
  with tenacity&quot; (Note209) in the parish quite literally decimated the island's 
  population and, in Lucea, occasioned the hasty burial of victims in a separate 
  burial ground on the <I>Haughton Court</I> estate. The epidemic may have culled 
  many families but there were survivors among Richard Dickson's grandchildren, 
  great nephews and great nieces, although some had already begun to disperse 
  to meet business elsewhere in the island, moved as ever by the necessity to 
  shift for themselves. Several were already to be found in neighbouring parishes 
  and further a-field, particularly so by the end of the century as new lines 
  were cast abroad. </p>

<p>With the number of planters, merchants and traders being limited by demand 
  and with the planting of all crops diminished, professional and clerical occupations 
  for the &quot;middle sort&quot; beckoned even more than before, where they could 
  be got, for those who could not cut a niche in commerce or had little inclination 
  to do so. The occupation Minister of Religion could now be included as non-conformist, 
  Victorian zeal ensured the spread of new churches since restrictions on their 
  activities had been removed; the Presbyterian Kirk was particularly successful 
  in this part of the island and Richard James Dickson's cousins, William Fraser 
  Dickson and John Dickson, settled on this course for a living; all were Richard 
  Dickson's grandsons. John Campbell at <I>Rockspring</I> had already taken to 
  the cloth, George Malcolm the younger took up civil engineering and made a name 
  for himself in bridge building but the professions, and even modest clerical 
  work, called for an education beyond "public instruction" and education was 
  a matter which had already pre-occupied Mary Ann Malcolm (210), in 1839.</p>

<p>... I will that James McGregor the younger should receive five years of an 
  English Education at my Expense I will and desire that my Brothers Edgar and 
  Neil be allowed out of my Estate Sufficient Sum in addition to their own annuity 
  from my father to enable them to Complete their Education in England I give 
  my property of all kind and description to my mother In trust for the purpose 
  of carrying out the above Bequests ... (Note211)</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 211: Island Record Office, Jamaica: will of Mary Ann Malcolm.</font></p>
<p>For families of more modest means or with a greater burden of numbers, the 
  now well-established Rusea's Free School in Lucea provided an alternative and 
  the new churches also played their part. Martin Rusea, a French refugee who 
  settled in Hanover, had provided the endowment for a school in his will and 
  in 1777, the very year that John Dickson's children abandoned their education 
  in Scotland, a trust (Note212) was formalised to support the school. The irony 
  may not have been lost on Dickson, considering the trouble and embarrassing 
  expense of his children's Scottish jaunt; at least his succeeding generations 
  were able to benefit from a schooling that was to be so English in style, thanks 
  to the foresight and philanthropy of a Frenchman.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 212: A Trust was eventually established, some years after 
  Rusea's death, by an Act of the Assembly on 3rd December 1777.</font></p>

<p>While the voice of the West India Committee men echoed older,
commercial connections of money from across the sea, the financial
arrangements of the past were a thing of the past with both lenders
and borrowers utterly circumspect in their speculations, especially
now with land values so eroded; no more the tempting announcements of
some seventy years before when the value of property could just
support the size of loans wanted. 
</P>
<P>Such proprietors of Sugar Plantations in this island, as are
desirous of raising Sums of Money, in Great Britain, by Mortgage or
Grant of Annuities, whose securities are unexceptionable, and where
the Produce of the Estate shall be judged adequate for the due
payment of the sums wanted, will be informed of the steps necessary
to be taken to secure such advances, by applying to the office of
Messrs. East, Grant and East, Attornies at Law in Kingston. (Note213)</p>

<p>A newer generation of Hanover merchants and planters, now thoroughly Jamaican 
  but with thoroughly familiar names, put matters of finance and influence into 
  their own hands and found merit in necessity within the Hanover Society of Industry 
  [1855] set up for the &quot;promotion and encouragement of industry, and for 
  developing the agricultural and other resources of the Parish of Hanover&quot;. 
  (Note214) The Hanover Savings Bank, established by the same group of men in 
  the following year (Note215), included among its many subscribers the Rev. John 
  Campbell, George Malcolm, William Browne and Dicksons, Richard James and his 
  cousin John Besly.</p>

<p><font size="-1">Note 214: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1855.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 215: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1855.</font></p>
<p> Local self reliance and mutual trust were to become their solution to the 
  financing of Hanover affairs but even these activities had a foot in the past 
  as the term &quot;merchant&quot; retained its largely 18th century, island flavour 
  of one who dabbled in virtually anything and everything that could turn a shilling 
  - the very variety of engagements that wiser residents had learned to adopt 
  years before as a means to some independence. Although less &quot;rich and easy 
  in circumstances&quot; and in business on a lesser scale, they had avoided the 
  ruinous debt entrapment which had ensnared so many of their predecessors, as 
  well as their contemporaries, who were then left quite unequal to the task of 
  trimming their cloth to suit reduced means.</p>
<p>Yet, even island finance for island property among acquaintances, family and 
  business partners was not an entirely new departure as this too had an earlier 
  beginning. Neill Malcolm, in 1773, had advanced money by mortgage to William 
  Gilchrist for <i>Rutherglen</i> plantation in Hanover; John Campbell at <I>Salt 
  Spring </I>had relied on his cousin Duncan's advances; Thomas and George Reid, 
  on separate occasions in the last decade of the 18th century, had negotiated 
  mortgages on <I>Belvedere </I>in Hanover from George Hibbert, Leonard Parkinson 
  and George Barrett, merchants and landowners (Note216); Neill McCallum, thirty 
  years later, had been a creditor to Benjamin Capon through William Dickson, 
  Capon's attorney.</p>

<P><font size="-1">Note 216: Details are from <b>Caribbeana</b>, Vols. 2 and 4, 
  cited above, deeds relating to Jamaica.</font></p>
<P> The fact that many of these men shuttled between Jamaica and London did not 
  make them any the less &quot;of Jamaica&quot; than their successors. They had 
  a more intimate understanding of the nature of the planting business, were less 
  likely to be distracted by over-exuberant expectation and were more circumspect 
  in financial matters amongst themselves. In mercantile affairs, too, the pooling 
  of capital, loans, risk and responsibility in partnerships had, more often than 
  not, been a feature of established trade as joint ventures came and went according 
  to need and opportunity.</p>


<P>And the old threads still patterned social and family intercourse; William 
  Augustus' widow, Ann Robina, inherited the property <I>Chelsea</I> (Note217) 
  from her mother's family (Kerr) through her sister and counted among her friends 
  Mary Ann Malcolm whose will she witnessed; Richard James Dickson assigned a 
  marriage settlement [1858] of <I>Bridge House </I>(Note218)<I>,</I> near the 
  Court House in Lucea, to his wife, Catherine Malcolm and future children having 
  found &quot;trade in respectable circumstances&quot; dealing principally in 
  leather and boots and shoes, his father and uncle having retired to farms in 
  the parish of Manchester over a decade before. (Note219)</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 217: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1865. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 218: Island Record Office, Jamaica: Deed, 25 January 1858.</font></p>
  
  
<p> <font size="-1">Note 219: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1845.</font></p>
<p>Not all of Richard James's cousins, though, had lasted thus far; William Augustus' 
  son Rhodes James had died the year after his father and William Brown was gone 
  too by the close of the cholera years; also about to go was the last tangible 
  and, by now, distant link with Scotland. Their younger brother, Augustus Murray, 
  chose to sell off the share, now his by default, of grandmother Alison Murray's 
  houses in Lasswade and, as with the debts of his great uncle and grandfather 
  in the previous century, the business was wholly a family matter. The properties 
  were bought up [1858] by cousin Robert Muir (Note220), a banker in Shrewsbury, 
  who was another part owner through his mother, Elizabeth Dickson, William Augustus's 
  sister and Augustus's aunt; she had married [1795] Alexander Muir, who took 
  over as innkeeper in Lasswade from his father-in-law, William.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 220: NAS, Register of Sasines: RS 27/2209 f.164.</font></p>
<p> Now the principal successor to his father's commercial legacy but with the 
  wharves at Green Island and Davis's Cove sold off and with some additional capital 
  from the Scottish sale, Augustus was tempted to the business which had occupied 
  his great uncle, John of Salem, some 100 years or so before but which his father 
  had later turned his back on; he took up <I>Riley</I> sugar plantation, a mere 
  mile away from the wharf at Lucea. (Note 221)</p>
<p><font size="-1">Note 221: <b>Jamaica Almanac</b>, 1877.</font></p>
<P>Was it only accident that a great majority of the larger Hanover estates which 
  remained intact and were still working in the early 20th century had, for a 
  long time, been wholly or partly, cattle concerns or had latterly turned to 
  bananas as a viable crop? One hundred years before, their owners had already 
  made a &quot;merit of necessity&quot;; estates then were already changing from 
  mere speculations for large money in sugar by those who had &quot;not such an 
  affection for the country as to wish to remain in it,&quot; (Note222) to become 
  a way of life returning a more modest income for resident owners.</P>
<P><font size="-1">Note 222: 1767, Dugald Malcolm to his father.</font></P>
<P> In 1754 there had been 76 large estates in the parish and cane dominated talk 
  of produce and profit; one hundred and fifty years later 78 large estates (Note223) 
  were still going concerns but the emphasis had shifted to livestock. The widespread 
  smallholdings continued to grow coffee, ginger and pimento, crops which had 
  always threaded the larger pattern woven by sugar. The names Malcolm and Watson-Taylor 
  still represented large holdings, occupied in the main by family or relatives, 
  and if some of the older names had changed, much was due to inheritance by marriage 
  or astute sales. There was also new blood, new money and commercial activity, 
  both wholesale and retail, that was more widespread. Governor Knowles, who had 
  submitted the 1754 return of landowners, would have recognised only two family 
  names noted some one hundred and sixty years later as owning estates in the 
  parish: Dehaney and James, the latter as old as the island's English and British 
  history.</P>








<p><font size="-1">Note 223: Jamaica Directory, 1910: of 78 working estates in 
  the parish, cattle were now bred on 44, bananas grown on 4 while 14 were in 
  mixed cultivation; only 7 were in sugar production; ginger and pimento were 
  the crops of small-holders. In the neighbouring parish of St. James only 33 
  large estates had survived of which 15 grew sugar cane. </font></p>
