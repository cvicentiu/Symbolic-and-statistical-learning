Notes for Michael Dickson:
The Michael Dickson family was living in Reynoldsburg, TN on the Tennessee River when the terrible 
Indian raid, known as the Johnson Massacre, occurred in 1815. In the spring of 1816 Michael and his 
family escaped in a small keel boat and landed at the Big Spring at what is now Tuscumbia, Alabama. He 
bought all of the land from "the mountain on the south and the river on the north, and from the great spring 
to its mouth" from the old chief Tash-Ka Ambi. For this land Michael paid 2 pole axes and $4 in cash. It 
was known as the tomahawk claim and was recognized by the US Government when the land was acquired 
from the Indians by treaty.
Michael Dickson and his family were the first white settlers in what would become Tuscumbia. When a 
vote was taken whether to name the settlement for Chief Tas- Ka- Ambi (Tuscumbia) or for Michael's 
daughter little Ann, the old Indian Chief won by one vote. He proudly presented little Ann with a pair of 
moccasins, calling her "Little-Two-shoes". In 1938 a New York artist painted a mural on the east wall of 
the newly erected Post Office building entitled "Chief Tash-Ka- Ambi Greets the Dickson Family".
Michael built a row of log cabins - the first hotel in the area - for stage coach passengers. The route through 
Tuscumbia became known as Military Road.
Later, Michael moved with his growing family to Russellville, Franklin Co., AL, where he served as 
County Clerk for about 18 years.
Michael's next move was to Hernando, DeSoto Co., Mississippi. After Sene's death, Michael returned to 
Russellville, along with his son Joseph and Joseph's family. He made his home with them until he died in 
1859.

Louis Thomas Dickson Jr (LT) had a lifetime full of travel.  He was born and raised in the South 
but during his lifetime he lived in many places in the USA as well as a couple of foreign countries 
(India and Mexico).  His travels took him around the world and L.T. especially loved Japan.

A large part of L.T.'s career was devoted to Pharmaceutical Sales and Marketing. He worked for 
Johnson & Johnson and climbed the ladder there to the point that he was designated "Overseas 
Sales Manager".   In later life, L.T. worked for the University of Delaware and managed the 
bookstore there.  Upon retirement, he relocated to New Mexico.   Later, he and his wife June 
moved to Bedford, Indiana (the homeplace of much of June's family).   It was there that L.T. 
passed away.

Before he passed, though, he was hard at work gathering interviews of elderly artists - hoping to 
write a book about late life working and careers.  He spent a great deal of time in Santa Fe, NM 
interviewing elderly artists and fell in love with the area.   As a result, upon his death - the family 
scattered his cremains high in the mountains above Santa Fe.  (The Sangre de Cristo Mountains)
