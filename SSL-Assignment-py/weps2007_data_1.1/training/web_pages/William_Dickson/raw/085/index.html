    <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Within the movie industry, Walter Murch is 
    one of the most respected individuals in the business. He is a talented and 
    educated man who has not only edited a number of feature films over the 
    years, but he is considered the inventor of sound design. His imprint on the 
    art of film editing is impeccable. His mastering of sound is studied by many 
    who want to get into sound design, as well as by those who currently work in 
    that field.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As an editor, Murch's credits range from a 
    number of Francis Ford Coppola films like &quot;The Godfather<i>, </i>
    Part II<i>&quot; </i>
    (1974) to Anthony Minghella’s &quot;Cold Mountain<i>&quot; </i>(2003). As a sound 
    designer, a term he coined, his work can be heard on &quot;American Graffiti<i>&quot;
    </i>(1973) and &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), for which he won two 
    Oscars; one for editing and one for sound.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Murch is a lecturer, a teacher and a 
    theorist. Much of his insight into art, literature and classical music is 
    fascinating to listen to. Author Michael Ondaatje’s recent book, &quot;The 
    Conversations: Walter Murch and Art of Editing Film&quot; (Alfred A. Knopf, 
    New York, 2002) goes into depth with Murch on many of his theories, film 
    work and his life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One of Murch’s most interesting theories 
    on film revolves around his three fathers of film. I was fortunate to have 
    him describe this theory, as well as his work on restoring the first sound 
    film, &quot;The Edison/Dickson Experiment.&quot; </font></p>

    William Kallay, From Script To DVD</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> Can you 
    describe your concept of the three fathers of film?</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Walter 
    Murch:</b> It’s an attempt to answer a tantalizing question: why did film 
    develop as a storytelling medium so quickly after its invention? It seems 
    natural to us today, but there were many people a century ago, including 
    even the inventors of film - Edison and the Lumière brothers - who did not 
    foresee this development. Lumière went so far as to say that cinema was &quot;an 
    invention without a future.&quot; And he could have been right: there are 
    frequently Inventions Without a Future - inventions which are ahead of their 
    time, or outside their appropriate culture: the Aztecs invented the wheel, 
    but didn’t know how to use it except as a toy. The Greeks did the same with 
    the steam engine. So you have to look not only at the invention itself, but 
    the social and cultural context which surrounds it. They all have to mesh, 
    and with film they meshed spectacularly well. Within twelve years of its 
    invention, film grammar is being determined in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; ­ the 
    cut, the closeup, parallel action - along with the social and economic 
    structures that would integrate cinema into the pattern of people’s daily 
    lives and make the whole thing pay for itself. Within another dozen years, 
    the feature film as we know it today was almost completely fleshed out, 
    thanks to D.W. Griffith and &quot;Birth Of A Nation.&quot; And then synchronous sound 
    was added twelve years later to virtually complete the equation.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What would 
    have happened, on the other hand, if somehow film had been invented in 1787 
    rather than 1887? Would we (at the time of the American Revolution) have 
    known what to do with it? Or would this imaginary 18th Century Cinema have 
    remained a kind of &quot;Aztec Wheel&quot; whose inherent potential would not be 
    realized for a hundred years?&nbsp; I rather suspect the latter, because there 
    were cultural movements that matured in the 19th century ­ the idea of 
    realism (from literature and painting), and dynamics (from music) - which 
    are actually as much a part of cinema as the technical nature of film 
    itself. And in 1787, realism and dynamics had not yet been born. And for 
    film to be Cinema, you need three things: film, realism, and dynamics. This 
    is where the idea of the Three Fathers comes in: Edison, Flaubert, and 
    Beethoven. Edison (let’s use him as shorthand to stand for all the technical 
    geniuses of early film) invented the physical side of film: its mechanical, 
    chemical nature. But fifty years earlier, writers like Flaubert (let’s use 
    him in the same shorthand way) invented the idea of realism ­ that by 
    meticulously observing ordinary reality, and writing these observations in a 
    certain way, you can extract a transcendent meaning from that ordinary 
    reality. And thirty years before Flaubert, composers like Beethoven (same 
    shorthand) invented the idea of dynamics ­ that by aggressively expanding, 
    contracting and transforming the rhythmic and orchestral structure of music 
    you can thereby extract great emotional resonance and power.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now I’m not 
    saying that there was a total absence of realism or dynamism in works of art 
    before 1800. That’s certainly not the case. But the 19th century intensely 
    focused and greatly expanded these concepts, and made them central to the 
    novel, to the symphony, to painting. As usual with revolutionary ideas, they 
    were not easily accepted at first. Realism seemed to some readers too 
    ordinary to be literature: if the writer was just describing what the reader 
    could see with his own eyes, why write at all!? When Manet exhibited his 
    painting of Olympia, there was an outcry because she was just an ordinary 
    girl, not a mythical creature. Mythical creatures could be painted in the 
    nude, but not ordinary girls who you could see walking down the street. And 
    when composer Carl Maria von Weber heard Beethoven’s Seventh symphony 
    (1813), he felt that &quot;Beethoven is quite ripe for the madhouse.&quot; Beethoven’s 
    music (compared to say, Haydn’s or Mozart’s) seemed to jump maniacally from 
    one topic to another, to abandon thematic ideas and pick them up later, 
    turned inside out. His music didn’t stick to the previous century’s more 
    ordered architectural model of composition - it substituted an organic, wild, 
    natural (sometimes supernatural) model that was exhilarating to the young 
    people who heard it and rather frightening to the older folks. &quot;He takes at 
    times the flight of an eagle, and then creeps in rocky pathways. He first 
    fills the soul with sweet melancholy, and then shatters it with a mass of 
    barbarous chords. He puts doves and crocodiles together in the same cage,&quot; 
    wrote a French music critic in 1810. When you listen to Beethoven’s music 
    now, and hear those sudden shifts in tonality, rhythm, and musical focus, it 
    is as if you can hear the grammar of film ­ cuts, dissolves, fades, 
    superimposures, long shots, close shots ­ being worked out in musical terms. 
    By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century these once-revolutionary ideas of 
    realism and dynamism had been thoroughly accepted into European culture: 
    generations of artists, writers, and composers ­ as well as society at large 
    ­ had by 1887 completely (and somewhat unconsciously) internalized these 
    ways of looking, thinking, listening. The whole 19<sup>th</sup> century was steeped in 
    realism and dynamism. And then along came Film: a medium ideally suited to 
    the dynamic representation of closely observed reality. And so these two 
    great rivers of 19th century culture ­ realism (from literature and 
    painting) and dynamism (from music) ­ surged together within the physical 
    framework of film to crystallize, within a few decades, the new artistic 
    form of cinema.</font></p>

    Murch</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> This was a real detective 
    story involving a forgotten, broken sound cylinder at Thomas Edison’s lab in 
    Menlo Park [New Jersey]. Patrick Loughney, the head of television and film at the Library 
    of Congress, developed an intuition that this cylinder might actually be the 
    soundtrack for a short kinetoscope that Edison made in 1894. The film is of 
    one of Edison’s key assistants ­ William Dickson ­ playing a violin into a 
    recording horn: it’s clear from looking at the image that the violin must 
    have been being recorded (on a cylinder) as they were filming. But the 
    accompanying sound had never been located. Until a few years ago, when 
    Patrick located this particular broken cylinder and had it repaired. In 
    fact, it turned out to be a recording of someone playing the violin. But the 
    Library of Congress had no means to put the image and the sound in sync: the 
    film was shot at 40 frames a second (rather than our standard today of 24) 
    and only lasted 17 seconds: whereas the sound on the cylinder was two and 
    half minutes long. So the question was: which 17 seconds of sound went with 
    the film? And then, once you’ve decided that, how do you put it in sync with 
    the film, which is playing at a non-standard frame rate?</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>FSTD:</b> 
    Quite a restoration dilemma. How did you get in touch with Mr. Loughney?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Murch</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> I was put in touch with 
    Patrick through Rick Schmidlin, who had produced the restoration of &quot;Touch Of 
    Evil,&quot; and Patrick asked if I could help them. I wound up digitizing both the 
    sound and the picture, and was consequently able to render the film at 
    normal speed and then find various sync points with the music. I tried 
    dozens and dozens over a period of a couple of hours until I finally found 
    the one that worked the soundtrack and the picture were finally in sync with 
    each other for the first time in a 106 years!</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>FSTD:</b> 
    Is this the first known recording of film with sound?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Murch</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> Yes. It pushes the threshold 
    of film sound back by a couple of decades. There’s anecdotal evidence of 
    something done a couple of years earlier, in 1891, but neither the film nor 
    the image for that have turned up yet.</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>FSTD:</b> 
    I’ve read somewhere that it was actually Dickson who really did most of the 
    work on the sound elements.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Murch</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> Well, not only that: Dickson 
    was the man who invented motion pictures as we know them: the use of 
    celluloid, the 35mm width, the size of the image, the sprocket wheel, the 
    four sprockets to each frame, and so on.</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>FSTD:</b> 
    Edison gets a lot of credit for the development of film.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Murch</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>:</b> Well, he should: Dickson was 
    an employee of the Edison research laboratory, after all. There were many, 
    many things, invented there over the years, including film. Edison obviously 
    had a controlling hand in it, but it was Dickson who actually did the 
    detailed work. And as I mentioned, Dickson is the man playing violin in that 
    test. So now you can see (and hear) the man who invented film, appearing in 
    the first sound film ever made!</font></font></p><hr>
