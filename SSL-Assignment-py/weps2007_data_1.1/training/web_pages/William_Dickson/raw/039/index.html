Thanks be to God therefore. But being arrived to an advanced age and knowing that by the course of Nature my latter end is near approaching, have thought the present time the most proper and Convenient to settle my Temporal affairs, and to make such arrangments in my family Concerns, and such distribution of my Property as I wish and intend shall stand good, and remain Permanent after my decease, being a matter I have for sometime past naturaly deliberated upon.
