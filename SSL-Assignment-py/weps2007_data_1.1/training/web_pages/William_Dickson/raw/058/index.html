<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">
Introduction:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mention the word &quot;Sheriff&quot; and many people’s minds will fill 
immediately with images of shootouts and gunfights in the Wild West. Such is the 
power of movies and television, which have so magnified the role of the 
19th-century American Sheriff that it is now virtually impossible to think of 
Sheriffs as existing in any other place or time. Most people would be surprised 
to know that the office of Sheriff has a proud history that spans well over a 
thousand years, from the early Middle Ages to our own &quot;high-tech&quot; era.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With a few exceptions, today’s Sheriffs are elected officials who 
serve as the chief law enforcement officer for a county. Although the duties of 
the Sheriff vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Sheriff’s office is 
generally active in all three branches of the criminal justice system: law 
enforcement, the courts and corrections.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The importance of the Office of Sheriff was expressed by Thomas 
Jefferson, who wrote in his <i><span style="COLOR: maroon">THE VALUE OF 
CONSTITUTIONS</span>, </i>“The Office of Sheriff is the most important of all 
the executive offices of the county.” President Ronald Reagan stressed this 
theme of importance in his address to the National Sheriff’s Association on June 
21, 1984. He said, &quot;Thank you for standing up for this nation’s dream of 
personal freedom under the rule of law. Thank you for standing against those who 
would transform that dream into a nightmare of wrongdoing and lawlessness. And 
thank you for your service to your communities, to your country and to the cause 
of law and justice.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>To appreciate the vital function that Sheriffs continue to serve, it 
is useful to become acquainted with the long and diverse history of the 
Sheriff’s Office. Here, we’ll see how that office has grown and changed over the 
past twelve (12) centuries. Then we’ll look in greater detail at the role of the 
Sheriff today.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><strong>The Office of Sheriff is one of antiquity. With 
the exception of king, no non-religious office in the English-speaking world is 
older. A history of the Sheriff is a history of man's self-government. It is a 
history, which begins in the Old Testament, continues through the annals of 
Judeo-Christian tradition. It is the oldest law enforcement office known within 
the common-law system and it has always been accorded great dignity and high 
trust. Indeed, there is no honorable law enforcement authority in Anglo-American 
law so ancient as that of the County Sheriff. Sheriffs have served and protected 
the English-speaking people for a thousand years. The Office of Sheriff and the 
law enforcement, judicial and correctional functions he performs are more than 
1000 years old and today, as in the past, the County Sheriff is a peace officer 
entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of domestic 
tranquility.</strong></p>
<h2><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">Ancient History: </span>
</strong></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Babylonians, Egyptians, and Hebrews - all had laws, 
and all must have had some kind of “Sheriff” to enforce them. There is no way of 
knowing who the first sheriff was, if indeed there was even a single first. 
Perhaps he was a Roman Pro-Consul or Saxon-German - or perhaps he was an Arab 
sheriff. Whoever he was, we know that there were sheriffs by the time the Book 
of Daniel was written:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Dan 3:2&nbsp; “Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to 
gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the 
treasurers, the counsellors, <i><span style="COLOR: #993300">the sheriffs</span></i>, 
and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image 
which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.” KJV</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: blue">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">English 
History: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The tradition of the Office of Sheriff truly began 
in England, dating back at least to the reign of Alfred the Great of England, 
and some scholars even argue that the Office of Sheriff was first created during 
the Roman occupation of England.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Office of Sheriff became bedrock of English society and 
government, and the High Sheriff was for centuries the pivot around which the 
machinery of government was to turn. The whole constitutional, economic, 
judicial and administrative development was dependent on the office of High 
Sheriff. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The concepts of “county” and “Sheriff” were 
essentially the same today as they have been during the previous 1200 years of 
English legal history. The county form of government and the Office of Sheriff 
are inseparable and because of the English heritage of the American colonies; 
the new United States of America adopted the English law and legal institutions 
as it’s own. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: #993300">
Anglo-Saxon Sheriff:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Around 500 AD, Germanic tribes from Europe (called 
the Anglo-Saxons) began an invasion of Celtic England, which eventually led over 
the centuries to the consolidation of Anglo-Saxon England as a unified kingdom 
under Alfred the Great late in the 9<sup>th</sup> Century (871 – 901). Alfred 
divided England into geographic units called “shires”, or counties. </strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Early Anglo-Saxon communities were fiercely 
independent, resisting any form of central control. People lived in small rural 
tuns, the source of the modern English word town. These Anglo-Saxons were often 
at war. Sometime before the year 700, they decided to systematize their methods 
of fighting by forming a system of local self-government based on groups of ten. 
Each tun was divided into groups of ten families, called tithings. The elected 
leader of each tithing was called a tithingman.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><strong>The tithings were also arranged in tens. Each 
group of ten tithings (or a hundred families) elected its own chief. The 
Anglo-Saxon word for chief was gerefa, which later became shortened to reeve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>During the next two centuries, a number of changes occurred in this 
system of tithings and reeves. A new unit of government, the shire, was formed 
when groups of hundreds banded together. The shire was the forerunner of the 
modern county. Just as each hundred was led by a reeve (chief), each shire had a 
reeve as well. To distinguish the leader of a shire from the leader of a mere 
hundred, the more powerful official became known as a shire-reeve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The word shire-reeve eventually became the modern English word 
Sheriff. The Sheriff was in early England, and metaphorically is in present-day 
America, the keeper, or chief, of the county.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although every freeman pledged the good behavior of his neighbor, 
there was some need for law enforcement. Under Alfred the Great, who assumed the 
throne in 871 AD, reeves began to be combined, forming shires or counties, each 
shire led by a shire-reeve. Throughout the ninth and tenth centuries, the Saxon 
Kings were appointing shire-reeves and then, latter, high shire-reeves as royal 
servants, trusted and loyal, to manage their affairs in the more distant parts 
of their Realm. A new title began to appear, Scirgerefa—a combination of two 
Anglo-Saxon words: scir meaning shire, and gerefa [meaning] a reeve or guardian. 
This title was soon to be abbreviated to shireeve and then finally to 
sheriff—the guardian of the shire.&nbsp; “Keeper and Chief of his county.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>King Alfred had not long been dead, Ethelred the Unready was on the 
throne, and King Canute was soon to invade Wessex. The Danes were doing what 
Danes did best in the tenth century—pillaging, ravaging and ravishing! There was 
still no united Kingdom of England let alone Scotland and Wales, and the Battle 
of Hastings, 1066, was 74 years away. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Out of this disunited and disorganized society arose a Crown 
appointment known then and one thousand years later as the High Sheriff. Through 
the centuries the powers of the High Sheriff have grown and latterly declined. 
But in the days of Ethelred and Canute and for many centuries afterwards, he was 
a force to be reckoned with. In those early days, the scirgerefa was Chancellor 
of the Exchequer, home secretary, secretary of state for defense, minister for 
agriculture and a host of other appointments all rolled into one great Crown 
office. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #333300">Hue and Cry – Bear the 
Wolf’s Head</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The shire-reeve or sheriff was the chief law enforcement officer of 
his county, responsible for interpreting the law and maintaining and order 
within his own county. But every tithing man was expected to share the 
obligation, remaining the duty of every citizen to assist the Sheriff in keeping 
the peace. If a criminal or escaped suspect was at large, it was the Sheriff’s 
responsibility to give the alarm – the hue and cry, as it was called. Any member 
of the community who heard the hue and cry was then legally responsible for 
helping to bring the criminal to justice. This principle of direct citizen 
participation survives today with the procedure known as posse commitatus. In 
the earliest days, the sheriff would pronounce sentence of outlawry with the 
words “let him bear the wolf’s head.” This meant that the outlaw could be hunted 
down and slain in the same way that marauding wolves were hunted. The sheriff 
could then raise “the hue and cry” officially known as the “posse comitatus” or 
power of the county. Eventually sheriffs assigned four to six men in each tun to 
night watch, and they patrolled, carrying lantern and staff. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A few centuries later a new form of law enforcement began when 
officers were employed to assist the Shire-reeve to enforce laws of the county. 
These Officers were known as,” comes stabuli”, or constable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Around the thirteenth century the position of “Bailiff” evolved. He 
was responsible for maintaining a night watch inside the locked gates of the 
city. The Bailiff was a paid position, male who was over the age of sixteen and 
generally was untrained for their jobs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Landholders, who were known as serjeants because they acquired their 
land through military service and were often called upon to assist the bailiff 
in his duties as their city would grow in size. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Between 700 and 800, noblemen who had been granted 
large estates by the king generally appointed sheriffs. They were supposed to 
protect the interests of the noblemen who appointed them. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: #993300">Norman Sheriff:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The days of the Saxon sheriffs were numbered. The tradition of 
extreme localism came to an end in 1066, at the Battle of Hastings, when Duke 
William of Normandy, William the Conqueror and the Normans, who were invaders 
from France, defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Harold. William, who did not believe 
at all in local government, instituted his own Norman centralized form of 
government in England. Rule was greatly consolidated under the Norman king and 
his appointees, centralizing their power. This centralization of government also 
began to centralize law enforcement. More than ever before, the sheriff became 
an agent of the king. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Saxon sheriffs from all the southern counties—Wiltshire and 
Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Sussex and Kent, Middlesex and Berkshire—rode at 
the head of their levies of armed men to take up battle stations under the King 
Harold’s standard—the Golden Dragon of Wessex. For a few years, it suited 
William to retain the services of many Saxon sheriffs, but by 1076 not one 
English sheriff was left in office and the Normans had taken over. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Both under the Anglo-Saxons and under the Normans, the King of 
England appointed a representative called a “reeve” to act on behalf of the king 
in each shire or county. The “shire-reeve” or King’s representative in each 
county became the “Sheriff” as the English language changed over the years. The 
shire-reeve or Sheriff was the chief law enforcement officer of each county in 
the year 1000 AD. During the reign of William the Conqueror, the sheriff had 
almost unlimited power. He was virtual ruler of the county, responsible for its 
revenues, military force, police, jails, courts and the execution of its writs. 
The importance of the office resulted not only from the scope of the Sheriff’s 
duties, but also from his direct relationship to the central government. The 
Crown appointed English sheriffs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But if the office holders were no more, the office itself remained 
with little change. If anything, many of the Norman sheriffs were more 
unscrupulous than their Saxon predecessors. William began selling the shrieval 
office to the highest bidder and the methods used to recover the purchase costs 
were furiously condemned by the monkish chroniclers of the period. [Norman 
sheriffs] were also men of considerable imagination and inventiveness when it 
came to recouping some of the costs of their high office. One sheriff in the 
reign of King John raised money by kidnapping the mistresses of the clergy, 
returning them to their monastic lovers only after a high ransom had been paid.
</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>In 1085, King William ordered a compilation of all 
taxable property in a census known as the Domesday Book. The sheriff became the 
official tax collector of the King. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Norman sheriffs were not liked in the shires, for apart from 
their tax collecting, they were looked on as hated foreigners. They had to adopt 
often-brutal methods to enforce their authority. These were violent 
times—revolts and conspiracies abounded. The sheriffs appeared to function best, 
from the point of view of the King, when left to their own devices. Gradually 
however, their own devices became too much even for the mildest of Monarchs in 
spite of their skills in raising the funds required. They began to consider 
their offices hereditary, and shortly after the death of William the Conqueror 
in 1087, the sheriffs began to challenge the authority even of the King. The 
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that there was “great commotion and treason 
everywhere.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>There were no police, no judges, not even magistrates, no internal 
revenuers, no customs and excise officers. The scir-reeve did the lot. He had 
the powers of arrest, he could raise armies, collect taxes and levies, and he 
presided over courts, dealt with traitors and generally supervised on the King’s 
behalf everything that went on in the Kingdom. With all this power, many of the 
sheriffs were, as is recorded of a certain Godric, sheriff of Berkshire and 
Buckinghamshire, “colorful old scoundrels”. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The sheriff’s activities, colorful or otherwise, are recorded at 
length in Domesday Book. As collectors of taxes, they made few friends, and 
since the monks and clerics were both the chief chroniclers of the day, and also 
an important source of revenue for the high reeve, the tabloids of the tenth 
century and several centuries thereafter are filled with the misdeeds of the 
sheriffs. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bishop Wulfstan, in the reign of King Ethelred, denounced the reeves 
for their “injustice, plundering, subtlety, perverse judgment and trickery.” The 
gossip writers of the tenth century had a field day with the sheriffs. </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Partly because of this commotion and partly because he felt that the 
sheriffs were pocketing for themselves more than their fair share of their 
fund-raising ventures, William Rufus, who succeeded his father the Conqueror, 
began the gradual dismemberment of their judicial powers. A powerful royal 
official, the itinerant justice, began roaming throughout the shires keeping a 
watchful eye on the wheelings and dealings of the sheriffs. From these early 
beginning came the justices of the peace a few centuries later and these were 
soon to have sufficient authority to imprison a sheriff for his misdeeds. By the 
end of the reign of Henry I (1135) the sheriff was firmly under the control of 
the Monarch. His judicial powers had been curbed, his duties as royal revenue 
collector were watched closely, and he was subject to stiff fines or even 
dismissal for any misdemeanors. The length of his term of office was also 
decided by Henry. </strong></p>
<p><strong>But in these early centuries of the first millennium, the sheriff was 
able to bounce back with amazing dexterity. Under Stephen in the twelfth 
century, [the sheriff] regained much of the authority lost under Henry I. Henry 
II once again reversed this trend and, indeed, at one point, sacked the entire 
shrievalty pending an inquiry into their behavior. The idea of sacking the 
sheriffs appears to have caught on, for Richard I repeated the exercise and then 
sold the office back to the highest bidder so as to raise funds for the 
Crusading Wars. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was during the reign of Henry II that the sheriffs and then the 
itinerant justices gave themselves, for the first time, the power to imprison. 
This was always done in a way that the prisoner could “put an end” to it by 
paying money. The Latin for end is “finis” and so the word “fine” emerged.
</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>In 1116, Henry I, established a penal code, in 
which murder, arson, counterfeiting, and robbery were made felonies. Although 
the Crown reserved to itself the power to punish, investigation and apprehension 
were delegated to his law enforcement officials, the sheriffs. Through the next 
century, as the power of the king increased, so did that of his law enforcement 
officers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dictatorial rule by a series of powerful kings became more and more 
intolerable over the years. Finally, in 1215, an army of rebellious noblemen 
forced the despotic King John to sign the Magna Carta. This important document 
restored a number of rights to the noblemen and guaranteed certain basic 
freedoms. The sheriff played a prominent part in the creation of the Magna 
Carta, with fourteen former and existing holders of the office either in an 
advisory capacity or as the main participants. Of the 63 clauses, 27 are 
directly concerned with the sheriff and his office, and so the Magna Carta is 
looked upon as the finest proof of the importance of the sheriff in the 
governing of medieval England. The Magna Carta, firmly and permanently 
established the importance and authority of the Office of Sheriff.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It was during this century that hereditary sheriffs disappeared, as 
well as the practice of renting shires to sheriffs. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1235, every shire received a new sheriff who was still responsible 
for revenues owing to the national exchequer. Also at this time, the sheriff was 
given a new function, which he still retains in the twentieth century, as 
parliamentary returning officer. They were ordered in 1254 to preside over the 
election of two knights to represent each shire at Westminster. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The story of the sheriff over the next few centuries is so fraught 
with intrigue, conspiracy, danger and unrewarding—even loathsome—duties, that it 
is astonishing that men could be found to accept the office. Indeed, there are 
more accounts of desperate and usually unsuccessful attempts to avoid 
appointment than there are of men willing to take on this “honorable burden”. 
One of their loathsome duties was thrust upon them by a statute of the early 
fifteenth century, which decreed that any person convicted of teaching anything 
contrary to the Catholic faith should be passed over to the sheriff who should 
“have them burned before the people in some prominent place.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>The office of sheriff in medieval times, and for many centuries 
thereafter, was not one that was universally sought. The holders often found 
themselves deep in debt or in prison for failure to balance their account with 
the exchequer. This increase in harassment by exchequer officials meant that not 
only was there no longer any profit to be made out of the sheriff’s office, but 
it was rapidly becoming a financial burden, and those who undertook these duties 
did so at considerable risk. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the next few centuries, the Sheriff remained the leading law 
enforcement officer of the county. To be appointed Sheriff was considered a 
significant honor. The honor, however, was a costly one. It was expensive to be 
sheriff. If the people of the county did not pay the full amount of their taxes 
and fines, the sheriff was charged with collecting taxes and fines on the kings 
behalf and was held personally responsible to the crown for amounts which went 
unpaid, requiring the difference to be made up out of his own pocket. 
Furthermore, the Sheriff was expected to serve as host for judges and other 
visiting dignitaries, providing them with lavish entertainment at his own 
expense.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For these reasons, the office of Sheriff was not often sought after. 
In fact, many well-qualified men did everything they could to avoid being 
chosen. The law on this point was quite clear – if a man was chosen to be 
Sheriff, he had to serve.</strong></p>

Westminster Period – Commonwealth Period Sheriff:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>During the Westminster Period, 1275 to 1500, 
governmental reforms created the offices of bailiff and sergeant, supplementing 
the sheriff. But county government remained in the hands of the sheriff. He was 
the most important official, and frequently was known as the “great man” of the 
county. So it remained throughout the Commonwealth Period, 1653 to 1712.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: #993300">Tudor 
Sheriff:</span></b></p>
<p><strong>Under the Tudor Monarchs in the sixteenth century, the sheriffs again 
began to lose many of their powers. Justices of the peace were taking over the 
judicial functions in the counties. Henry VIII was suspicious of the loyalties 
of the sheriffs and did little to strengthen their position. The Tudors 
distrusted them also as collectors of royal revenues. Henry dealt a cruel blow 
to the authority of the sheriff when, towards the end of his reign, he created 
“lords lieutenant” to take over as the military leaders of the shire. However, 
the sheriff remained the King’s chief representative in the county until 1908 
when Edward VII gave the lords lieutenant precedence over the sheriffs. </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>At last, in the eighteenth century, as the office of high sheriff 
became an ever-greater financial burden to its holders, Parliament came to the 
rescue. There was a commission of inquiry, and in 1717, two statues were passed 
which provided special allowances and did much to ease the burdens of the 
office. As the twentieth century millennium came ever closer, and one by one the 
ancient powers of the sheriff slowly disappeared under the weight of modern 
legislation, two events took place that can claim to be as legislatively and 
symbolically significant as anything in the one thousand years of the 
Shrievalty. First, in 1833, came the act that swept away, after nine hundred 
years, all tax and revenue collecting duties of the sheriff, and second with the 
disappearance of these duties went the terrifying ordeal of the annual 
accounting of these revenues before the national exchequer.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">American History:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When settlers left England to colonize the New World, they took with 
them many of their governmental forms, including their law enforcement system. 
The Office of Sheriff traveled with these colonists. In New England, where towns 
and villages were the principal governmental units, the watch and ward was used. 
In the Middle Atlantic and Southern states, where people settled on plantations 
and small farms the county system of government was natural and strong, The 
Office of Sheriff was more important here, than in those areas where local 
government centered in towns or townships. </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: #993300">
Colonial Sheriff:</span></b></p>
<p><strong>The first colonists arrived in Virginia was in 1607, and by 1619 they 
became self-governing under the auspices of the English parent form of rule. The 
first form of law enforcement on the continent was not the sheriff but provost 
marshals and marshals who operated under a central authority for military 
matters from 1625 to 1627. In 1634, Virginia was divided by statute into eight 
shires, or counties, which was governed in an adaptation of the overseas model. 
Along with the shire form of government came the administrative position of 
sheriff. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1634, William Stone was appointed the first sworn sheriff in 
America by becoming the sheriff in the County of Accomac, Virginia and served 
two (2) consecutive one-year terms. The first sheriffs in Virginia were selected 
from exclusive influential groups of large landholders within the counties.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is some debate as to the who, where and when of the first 
sheriff in America.&nbsp; Some researchers state that America's first sheriff was 
Lord William Baldridge, appointed in 1634 in St. Mary's County, Maryland.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>A series of statutes involving the appointment of county offices and 
office holders were created. A Virginia proclamation of March 13, 1651 required 
each county to choose a sheriff. In an interesting departure from the previous 
appointment process, which would prove to be prophetic in future years, the 
commissioners of Northampton County Virginia asked its inhabitants to elect its 
sheriff. In 1651 William Waters became the first elected sheriff in America.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although this particular Sheriff was chosen by popular vote, most 
other colonial Sheriffs were appointed. In both states the sheriff was delegated 
the same powers of the office held in England.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just as noblemen in medieval England had depended upon Sheriffs to 
protect their tracts of land, large American landowners appointed Sheriffs to 
enforce the law in the areas they controlled. Unlike their English counterparts, 
however, American Sheriffs were not expected to pay extraordinary expenses out 
of their own pockets. Some Sheriffs – most of whom were wealthy men to begin 
with – even made money from the job.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>As in England, law strictly enforced respect for 
the sheriff. A special seat often was reserved for him in church. Contempt 
against the sheriff was considered an offense punishable by whipping. At this 
time, sheriffs were responsible for both enforcing the law and punishing 
offenders. The power extended to dealing with religious nonconformists.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>By the time the colonies of the New World were 
united a century later, the sheriff was no longer appointed. He was elected. 
Fortunately, the Office of the Sheriff remains an elected position in Tennessee 
and elsewhere and in virtually all jurisdictions, including Tennessee; the 
sheriff is the only law enforcement officer who is directly accountable to the 
public at large.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, American Sheriffs were 
assigned a broad range of responsibilities by colonial and state legislatures. 
Some of these responsibilities, such as law enforcement and tax collection, were 
carried over from the familiar role of the English Sheriff. Other 
responsibilities, such as overseeing jails and workhouses, were new.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, the most common 
punishments for crimes that did not warrant the death penalty had been flogging 
or other sorts of physical mutilation. When confinement became favored as a more 
civilized way to deal with criminals, authorities in medieval England introduced 
the county jail. They began to experiment with other sorts of facilities as 
well. Among these was the workhouse, where minor offenders were assigned useful 
labor, and the house of correction, where people who had been unable to function 
in society could theoretically be taught to do so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All three of these institutions were brought to colonial America and 
the responsibility for managing them was given to the colonies’ ubiquitous law 
enforcement officer – the Sheriff.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: #993300">“Wild West” - The 
Western Frontier Sheriff: </span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Horace Greeley, the Editor of the New York Tribune, wrote to the 
huddled masses in the eastern cities, “Go West Young Man!” and they did. As 
Americans began to move westward, they took with them the concept of county 
jails and the office of Sheriff. The Sheriff was desperately needed to establish 
order in the lawless territories where power belonged to those with the fastest 
draw and the most accurate shot. Here, it is said, Sheriffs fell into two 
categories: the quick and the dead. Most western Sheriffs, however, kept the 
peace by virtue of their authority rather than their guns. With few exceptions, 
Sheriffs resorted to firepower much less often than is commonly imagined.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In American history, the frontier was the western most area of 
settlement at any given time during the westward expansion of the nation. It 
began in Jamestown in 1607 and the line kept moving west. The period of time 
known as the &quot;Wild West&quot; was from about 1835 until 1895, and the area for which 
it identifies was roughly the land west of the Mississippi River. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The 19th Century was the golden age of the American Sheriff. Part of 
the significance of the Office of the Sheriff In the American West was derived 
from the rural conditions of the area. The vastness of the territories required 
broad jurisdictional enforcement needs. The other significance resulted in the 
general need for law enforcement in a relatively untamed and lawless condition 
that was rampant in the West. Because of the lawlessness, a need for powerful 
and unique personalities to control the crime issues was called for. As a 
result, colorful and dramatic persons were to hold the office of sheriff in the 
Wild West. These personalities have provided imagination fuel for our concepts 
of how the West was won. Characters like &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Bat 
Masterson, Pat Garrett, William “Bill” Tilghman, William Brenkenridge, Commodore 
Perry Owens and John Slaughter are all colorful part of American History.
</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The West was harsh and rugged and in order to 
conquer it, only the brave and strong could survive. The Louisiana Purchase of 
1803 almost doubled the size of the country and there was no shortage of 
settlers heading toward the setting sun. Many attitudes and principles 
accompanied these migrants. Rugged individualism, conquest, progress, free 
enterprise, the right to bear arms, and law and order principles reinforced 
American ideals. The sheriff was a major player in these processes.&nbsp; </strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Western centers of populations were small and 
isolated and usually exhibited a reasonable amount of peace and order. Most 
citizens in the West lived peacefully and without great fear of personal attack. 
The majority of the settlers were hard working, honest and honorable who came to 
build a new life in the West. Violence existed more as a by-product of the era 
and environment rather than a demonstration of true and total lawlessness. 
However, violence and crime were dramatically in existence during this period 
and sheriffs were an important part of crime fighting matters in the nineteenth 
century West.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Social misfits of various sorts, who had failed for 
various reasons in the East, followed the allure of the West and all its 
attractions. Thus, the West became a refuge for the potentially violent and 
lawless. The maladjusted became a basic equation for social turmoil. The 
heterogeneous population in the territories required a local control to deal 
with the complex issues of turbulence and crime. This was all very much like the 
need for local controls in government form that were needed in medieval England 
and Colonial America. As a result the Office of Sheriff was a ready-made entity 
to deal with the issues of crime on a local level. The idea that a position of 
this nature could be elected gave it an added dimension. It could reflect the 
needs of the community, and the citizens could have a direct input into the 
process of law and order by virtue of their vote.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confronted with serious issues of crime, disorder, vice, and 
violence, the pioneers of the old West turned to members of their communities to 
enforce order. With a multi-century background and history, the Office of 
Sheriff was a natural addition in this environment. Selection could be made by 
appointment, or in most cases by popular vote from community residents to select 
a sheriff. The countywide jurisdiction of the office fit very nicely in the law 
enforcement efforts and supervision of the vast countryside. The ability of the 
sheriff to respond to the hue and cry and to raise a posse helped greatly with 
the issues of crime and the isolated nature of the frontier. The office that had 
evolved over the centuries was a &quot;hand in glove fit&quot; for local law enforcement 
in the Wild West. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Office of the Sheriff spread from community to community 
throughout settled areas west of the Mississippi. Even isolated areas of the 
West generally had a sheriff as their governments developed. Legal provisions 
varied but essentially statutes called for an elected sheriff to be the primary 
police agent for the organized county governments. Terms usually varied between 
two and four years and a variety of checks and balances were placed providing 
for the removal of an official.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sheriffs were generally allowed to hire assistants or deputies to 
help with the day-to-day responsibilities of his office. He was also allowed to 
appoint citizens to perform certain functions to preserve the peace. The posse 
comitatus, or power of the county, enabled sheriffs to summon aid. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Along with general powers of arrests, states gave sheriffs widely 
divergent privileges. Wyoming allowed for sheriffs to use a residence for his 
law enforcement purposes at county expense. New Mexico extended jurisdictional 
limits of the sheriff to permit him or his deputies to enter all counties in the 
state to affect an arrest and to have concurrent rights of posse comitatus in 
every county. While the duties of sheriffs and their deputies were 
multitudinous, the primary law enforcement functions were virtually identical 
throughout the early West. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black">An 1861 Nevada statute illustrates typical 
duties of the sheriff:</span><span style="COLOR: #993300"> </span>&quot;It shall be 
the duty of Sheriffs and of their deputies to keep and preserve the peace in 
their respective counties, and to quiet and suppress all affrays, riots, and 
insurrections for which purpose, and for the service of process in civil and 
criminal cases, and in apprehending or securing any person for felony, or breach 
of the peace, they may call upon of their county&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>As chief law enforcement officer of the county, the sheriff performed 
diverse duties. In many jurisdictions he served as tax collector, similar to the 
duties of the colonial sheriff. Also in contrast to its colonial forerunner, the 
sheriff had to administer corporal punishment, as directed by the courts. The 
sheriff often times was required to carry out the sentence of death. These 
rustic executions in the Wild West were performed primarily by hanging an 
offender. Sometimes sheriffs constructed formal gallows for this purpose, and 
other times a rope was simply tossed over a stout tree limb to accomplish the 
execution.&nbsp; This onerous duty of a Western Sheriff is poetically illustrated by 
Judge Roy Bean’s (Hanging Judge, Law West of the Pecos) death sentence of a man 
convicted of murder in his court.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Other duties of the office, collateral to the crime fighting duties, 
were rather mundane and involved the service of process or other civil 
enforcement functions, which were performed usually under peaceful conditions. 
Some counties prescribed rather peculiar duties like inspecting cattle, fighting 
fires, or eradicating prairie dogs. No matter what the specific duties of a 
community required, universally by the later part of the nineteenth century, the 
sheriff occupied the preeminent position in law enforcement throughout the West.</strong></p>
<h1><strong><span style="COLOR: #333300">Posse – The Power of the County:</span></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Since the time of the early reeves in England, when help was needed 
to apprehend a criminal, a hue and cry could be made to enlist support with law 
enforcement efforts. The tradition followed the sheriff to the New World and it 
would become a foundation of law. As well as being a basis of law, it became a 
stimulus, which would capture the imagination of the American people and serve 
to inspire their will with regards to law and order. It invested the citizens in 
the law enforcement process and served to extend the office's usefulness by 
enabling and allowing for unlimited manpower resources at times of greatest 
need. In America the Latin term &quot;posse comitatus&quot; was used to describe this 
volunteer effort. Literally translated, posse comitatus means &quot;the power of the 
county&quot;. The authority of the posse comitatus was acquired through the powers of 
the office of sheriff and allowed the sheriff to recruit any person over the age 
of fifteen to aid in keeping the peace or to assist in the pursuit of felons. 
These efforts could be made with the presence of, or the absence of the sheriff. 
Much of the philosophies of law regarding citizen’s arrest powers are founded in 
the posse comitatus premise.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The posse comitatus would become shortened to a vernacular version of 
just &quot;posse&quot;. The American posse would become a mainstay of law enforcement 
discharge in the years to come. It would be employed to a great extent in the 
American Wild West period as a regular tool of marshals and sheriffs. The 
American posse would become romanticized in dime store novels and newspapers 
throughout the era. In later years it would again be romanticized in movies and 
television programs. The posse continues to be used in contemporary terms and 
still serves useful law enforcement purposes in many parts of the United States.</strong></p>

Sheriff:</span></strong></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The twentieth century brought a marked decline in 
strength of the Office of Sheriff in many parts of the country. Three (3) 
primary reasons for the decline are:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="COLOR: #ff6600">1)</span> Abuse of the 
political nature of the office,</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="COLOR: #ff6600">2)</span> Academic and

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="COLOR: #ff6600">3)</span> The lack of 
professionalism, standards and training.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>All these factors resulted in serious breaks of 
understanding of the Office of Sheriff, regarding it’s role and importance in 
the criminal justice system.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">
Politics:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Politics and the Office of Sheriff became 
universally intertwined in the twentieth century. Areas with large metropolitan 
populations, ‘political machines’ often controlled the Office of Sheriff and 
used as a political career stepping-stone. The post enabled the sheriff to make 
political appointments to enhance his own political stature. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Grover Cleveland is a good example of this process. 
He was elected sheriff in Erie County, New York prior his being a district 
attorney, New York State Governor, and eventually president of the United
</strong><b>States. Accounts of his term of office as sheriff identify him as a 
competent administrator. </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>This was not always the case.</b> <strong>The Office of 
Sheriff was often a stronghold for political patronage and opportunistic 
abilities for &quot;pocket lining&quot;. Corruption and abuse of the Office of Sheriff 
prompted numerous civic groups to take action, eventually leading to reforms, 
i.e., Civil Service and State Legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>As an elected official, the sheriff often times is 
more subject to popular will than an appointed police chief. Along those lines, 
from a professional police management perspective, the elected nature of the 
sheriff's office has presented problems indigenous to its own perspective. For 
instance: sheriffs with no law enforcement service or training have been elected 
to the position, sheriffs lacking skills have defeated sheriffs with greater 
skills by virtue of political popularity, there have been no statutory 
experience or education requirements placed on seeking the job, and survival in 
office has sometimes required political compromise at the expense of 
professional commitment.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The elected nature of the office has been cause for 
the most serious indictments of the office. Allegations regarding a sheriff 
being required to participate in partisan politics in order to hold his office 
are the most prevalent criticism. Yet in reality, all law enforcement executives 
are politicians in one form or another. Some may refute this assertion, but only 
out of misguided notions that politicians are evil or that an administrator 
cannot be a politician and a professional manager at the same time. 
Realistically, a politician is nothing more than a person accountable to the 
public for decisions made in the performance of duty. </strong></p>
<h1><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">
Academia and Media:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Office of Sheriff was frequently overlooked when police training, 
professionalism and </strong><b>administration</b><strong> was the topical 
discussion. Little, if any, emphasis was placed on the office in police 
literature, and if there was reference to the position it was generally 
unfavorable. Some of the academic police literature referrals to the Office of 
Sheriff during the time period of the 1920’s and 1930’s are as follows: “a 
dyeing medieval throwback”, “an outdated law enforcement institution” and &quot;dark 
continent of American politics&quot; When policing and law enforcement literature 
analyzed the office it was in the role as a jailer, court bailiff, process 
server, and county tax collector. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Historically, the tasks and roles of sheriff's departments and police 
departments have been fundamentally different. Sheriff's law enforcement 
functions have often been relegated to jurisdictions of sparse populations that 
could not support a municipal police agency. A false perception existed that the 
Sheriff law enforcement functions and problems were not the same as those 
inherent within in a municipality. In addition to the Sheriffs role as the 
keeper of the jail and the courts and service of civil process, were law 
enforcement duties. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sheriff’s limited portrayal may have been a partially correct 
during the early part of the twentieth century. This all changed somewhat after 
World War II, when populations expanded out to rural areas. This eliminated part 
of the distinction between sheriffs and chiefs when &quot;big city&quot; problems came to 
the country.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>As the nation's police interest was escalating, the 
Office of Sheriff was neglected or worse defamed. The media stereotyped sheriffs 
in contemptuous ways that degraded and almost never enhanced the stature of the 
office. Sheriffs (especially southern sheriffs) were characterized as corrupt, 
brutal, cruel, inhumane, prejudiced, lazy, stupid, inept, biased, and not even 
minimally effective.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>During the same time, other media representations 
of big city police departments were depicting policemen as smart, tough, 
attractive, compassionate, and able to solve the toughest crimes with heroic and 
brilliant efforts. As the image of sheriffs was being tarnished the counterpart 
police officers image was being polished. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>This made for a vivid contrast. The appearance of 
sheriffs was of ineffective creatures that had not evolved from the Wild West 
period while more modern police agencies were held out as paragons of 
excellence.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">Professionalism and 
Training:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Professional&quot; has been a difficult title for Sheriffs to earn. 
Throughout history, the office of Sheriff was awarded to the richest, the 
strongest or the luckiest – but not necessarily the best qualified. </strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The academia and media characterization was 
especially damaging in the rural South where the Office of Sheriff was often the 
most important, if not the sole law enforcement agency in the county and many 
it’s unincorporated areas. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The restrictions under which a sheriff must operate 
limited the standards of professionalism for the office. (1) The county 
frequently is so small and/or so impoverished as to make an adequate program of 
law enforcement difficult to support; (2) tenure sometimes is restricted by 
state statute or constitution; (3) professional qualifications for the office 
are virtually nonexistent; (4) compensation sometimes takes the form of fees and 
commissions rather than a fixed salary; and (5) the time and resources for law 
enforcement work ordinarily are reduced by the requirement that the sheriff 
other responsibilities and duties i.e., supervision of the county jail and its 
prisoners, service of civil process, and attending the courts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Office of Sheriff had and still today has to some extent, a large 
handicap to overcome, but is resilient, adaptable and enduring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA) was founded in 1940 to give 
a voice to the Sheriffs of America. The NSA invites every newly elected Sheriff 
to attend its two-week National Sheriffs’ Institute, conducted at the FBI 
Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The Institute provides Sheriffs with the latest 
available information in such areas as management, technology, law, personnel 
and jail administration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the 1960’s the Peace Officers Standard and Training Commission 
(P.O.S.T.) was created. P.O.S.T. operates under the authority of Tennessee State 
Law and mandates training (basic and in-service) for all Tennessee law 
enforcement officers. (State, County and City) </strong></p>
<p><strong>This mandated basic training (currently 10 weeks in length) is 
conducted at the Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy located in 
Nashville, TN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In-Service Training (annual 40 hours of training) is 
conducted locally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional law enforcement training is available at little or no 
costs to Sheriff’s Offices at the U.S. Justice Department’s Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, and the National Institute of 
Corrections’ National Academy of Corrections in Longmont, Colorado.</strong></p>
<h1><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">The Contemporary Office 
of Sheriff:</span></strong></h1>
<p><strong>In the minds of many Americans, the role of Sheriff ended with the 
taming of the &quot;Wild West.&quot; Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. 
There are more than 3,000 counties in the United States today, and almost every 
one of them has a Sheriff. Some cities, such as Denver, St. Louis, Richmond and 
Baltimore, have Sheriffs as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the majority of states, the office of Sheriff is established by 
the state constitution. Most of the remaining states have established the office 
by acts of their state legislatures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alaska is the only state in which the Office of Sheriff does not 
exist. The reason being Alaska has no county system of government.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are only two states in which the voters do not elect the 
Sheriff. In Rhode Island, the governor appoints Sheriffs. In Hawaii, the state’s 
chief justice appoints Sheriffs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because the office of Sheriff exists in so many different places and 
under so many different conditions, there is really no such thing as a &quot;typical&quot; 
Sheriff. Some Sheriffs still have time to drop by the town coffee shop to chat 
with the citizens each day, while others report to an office in a skyscraper and 
manage a department whose budget exceeds that of many corporations. Despite 
their differences in style, however, most Sheriffs have certain roles and 
responsibilities in common:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">Law Enforcement:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Most Sheriffs’ offices have a responsibility for law enforcement, a 
function that dates all the way back to the origins of the office in feudal 
England. Although the authority of the Sheriff varies from state to state, a 
Sheriff always has the power to make arrests within his or her own county. Some 
states extend this authority to adjacent counties or to the entire state.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many Sheriffs’ offices also perform routine patrol functions, such as 
traffic control and accident investigations, and transportation of prisoners. 
Larger agencies may perform criminal investigations or engage in other 
specialized law enforcement activities. Some large Sheriffs’ offices may have an 
air patrol (including fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters), a mounted patrol, or 
a marine patrol at their disposal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many Sheriffs enlist the aid of local neighborhoods in working to 
prevent crime. The Neighborhood Watch Program, sponsored by the National 
Sheriffs’ Association, allows citizens and law enforcement officials to 
cooperate in keeping communities safe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Sheriff’s law enforcement activities often involve assistance to 
those affected by crime. For example, the National Sheriffs’ Association’s 
Victim Witness Program, sponsored in partnership with the U.S. Department of 
Justice, offers training and technical assistance for Sheriffs who want to 
change the way in which the justice system responds to the needs of crime 
victims and witnesses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As the Sheriff’s law enforcement duties become more extensive and 
complex, new career opportunities for people with specialized skills are opening 
up in Sheriffs’ offices around the country. Among the specialties now in demand 
are underwater diving, piloting, boating, snow skiing, radar technology, 
communications, computer technology, accounting, emergency medicine and foreign 
languages (especially Spanish, French and Vietnamese).</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">Court Duties: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>In every state in which the office exists, Sheriffs are responsible 
for maintaining the safety and security of the court. A major function of the 
sheriff to the court is to provide bailiffs. Typical duties of the bailiffs are 
to provide court security, assist with the flow of cases, escort prisoners to 
and from the courtroom, and maintain juries, or to perform other court-related 
functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">Jail Administration:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Most Sheriffs’ offices maintain and operate county (parish) jails, 
detention centers, detoxification centers, and community corrections facilities 
such as work-release group homes and halfway houses. Sheriffs, and the jail 
officers under their authority, are responsible for supervising inmates and 
protecting their rights. They are also responsible for providing inmates with 
food, clothing, exercise, recreation and medical services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This responsibility has become more difficult as old jail facilities 
deteriorate and become overcrowded. The mid-1970s brought on an explosion of 
lawsuits filed by inmates to protest their conditions of confinement. In recent 
years, however, national and state commissions, along with the courts, have been 
working together with local authorities to make jails more hospitable and 
humane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This effort has brought Sheriffs and their jail officers into 
partnership with judges, district attorneys and corrections officials. As jail 
conditions improve, Sheriffs and their agencies are earning increased respect 
and recognition as professionals.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: #ff6600">Civil Process:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Another significant role of the sheriff is to provide civil law 
enforcement service on behalf of the courts. Municipal police officers are 
generally prohibited from performing this function. In the event enforcement is 
needed on behalf of the court, exclusive of criminal law enforcement, the 
sheriff is the primary agent in the United States to provide it. Civil process 
service, summonses, evictions, service of court orders, writs, repossession 
orders, child support orders, and orders of protection are typical issues that 
are dealt with by sheriff's personnel. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">The Future Office of 
Sheriff: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Along with myriad other changes being brought into the 21<sup>st</sup> 
Century comes come a new breed of Sheriff. Far from the stereotypical 
shoot-‘em-up lawman of the movies and television, today’s Sheriff is likely to 
have a college degree, a graduate degree in criminal justice, law or public 
administration, and several years’ experience in the criminal justice system. 
Law enforcement is increasingly complex in the new millennium. For the 
progressive, forward-looking Sheriffs’ Offices of today, education and training 
are the keys to effective job performance. A positive public perception is vital 
to the success of the Office of Sheriff today and in the future. This image can 
only be accomplished through professionalism. Sophisticated social and 
communication skills are essential for sheriffs and their employees to be able 
to gather community support. Sheriffs must realize that their representatives 
reflect upon the image of the leader and all acts, either good or bad, will 
reveal their effectiveness portrait.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the history of the office tells us nothing else it must be 
recognized that it is critical for sheriffs to maintain professional standards. 
Issues of integrity, ethics, neglect, misfeasance, and malfeasance of the Office 
of Sheriff, coupled with the lack of education and/or training, have been 
intertwined with the function for so long and for so many different reasons that 
it is difficult to separate fact from fiction with regard to professionalism. 
These issues of professionalism shall have to be addressed if the Office of 
Sheriff is to go boldly and brightly into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the county level, the sheriff, in most instances, represents one 
of the highest, if not the highest authority of law enforcement. Independence 
and self-governance is critically important to this office. Do to the elective 
nature of the position, it has an autonomous nature greater than that of other 
appointed law enforcement or correctional administrators. As the highest 
representative of the department, the sheriff answers ultimately to the voters, 
rather than to other government officials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the past some of the Office of Sheriffs’ greatest criticism and 
greatest problem lied within it’s political roots. This may in fact be its 
greatest asset. As an elected official, a sheriff can be a social force within a 
community. Being the sole law enforcement officer in which the electorate can 
either endorse or discharge, a sheriff can represent the public's will on issues 
of community importance. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Elections represent the very foundation of our country and reflect 
our democracy. A sheriff can act as a representative of the community within the 
criminal justice system. &quot;One voice one vote&quot; has provided for individual 
participation in the selection process of American leaders since the inception 
of our government. The elective process of selecting a sheriff can be translated 
into a positive issue about the office rather than a negative one. Sheriffs can 
point to the fact that if the public is not satisfied with the job they are 
doing, they can be voted out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many examples are being offered of new and innovative technologies in 
the immediate and not-to-distant future – some believable, some not so 
believable. Chances are, however, that people will remain very much the same. 
And therefore, the job of the Sheriff will remain much the same, as well. We 
will still need Sheriffs to enforce the law, to safeguard the courts and to 
maintain the jails. No matter what else changes, the Sheriff’s motto will 
remain: &quot;We Serve and Protect.&quot;</strong></p>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 24pt; COLOR: red">The Dickson County Sheriff’s Office</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">The Sheriff:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tom Wall is the Sheriff of Dickson County Tennessee having held the 
office since 1994.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">Purpose:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The purpose of the Dickson County Sheriff's Office is to provide 
community service. This includes crime prevention, deterrence, apprehension and 
detention of offenders, recovery and return of property, the safe movement of 
traffic and public service. Peace, in a free society, depends on voluntary 
compliance with the law.</strong></p>
<h3><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">Mission Statement:</span></h3>
<p><strong>The mission of the Dickson County Sheriff's Office is to protect 
lives and property through proactive crime prevention and the fair and impartial 
enforcement of federal, state and local laws, while working in partnership with 
members of the community.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: blue">Duties of the Sheriff:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sheriff is the Official responsible the County's law enforcement. 
This includes administration of the Jail, and execution of the will of the 
courts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The duties of the sheriff's office are quite varied. Except in 
Davidson County, the sheriff has the important duty to prevent crimes, 
investigate criminal conduct that has occurred, and arrest criminals. Sheriffs 
and their deputies must be thoroughly acquainted with the Tennessee criminal 
code. The sheriff should develop a good working relationship with the staff of 
the district attorney general's office. Sheriffs also serve as jailers and many 
serve as superintendent of the county workhouse (in some counties, the jail is 
also the workhouse). County jails are responsible for the housing of 
misdemeanant prisoners. Many county jails also house state prisoners (persons 
convicted of felony offenses) due to lack of space in state prison facilities. 
The sheriffs in these counties perform important functions in obtaining state 
reimbursement for expenses associated with housing state prisoners. Related to 
criminal casework, are duties requiring the sheriff to dispose of contraband, 
abandoned motor vehicles, and unlawful weapons. Sheriffs also have many duties 
that are civil in nature. They include the duty to execute and return, according 
to law, the civil process and orders of the courts of record and general 
sessions courts. Sheriffs and their deputies serve subpoenas, execute writs of 
possession, levy writs of execution (which involve taking property to satisfy 
judgments), serve garnishments, and serve orders of protection. Each of these 
civil duties, as well as many others, have specific requirements, time 
requirements, and duties with which the sheriff and deputy sheriffs must be 
familiar. Additionally, the sheriff, or an officer designated by the sheriff, 
must attend all courts held in the county. This is generally when a deputy 
sheriff acts as court officer or bailiff. Sheriffs and their deputies operate 
under strict legal standards and must strive to perform their duties correctly. 
For example, failure to respect the civil rights of citizens, including 
prisoners, can result in personal liability. The actions of sheriffs and 
deputies often serve as the basis of lawsuits initiated by persons displeased 
with what has happened to them. Sheriffs must be acquainted with the civil and 
criminal aspects of the federal civil rights laws, the Tennessee Governmental 
Tort Liability Act and numerous other laws.</strong></p>
<h3><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: green">Difference Between an Office and 
a Department:</span></h3>
<p><strong>What are the differences between sheriff's offices and other law 
enforcement agencies?</strong><b><br>
<strong>To understand the differences, one must look at the definitions of each 
term - department and office. The sheriff holds an office, while other top 
administrators are appointed to administer departments.</strong></b></p>
<p><strong><u><span style="COLOR: #993300">Department:</span></u> One of the 
major divisions of a branch of government. Generally, a branch
<span style="COLOR: black">or division of government subordinate to that 
government's administration.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><u><span style="COLOR: #993300">Office</span>:</u> A right and 
correspondent duty to exercise a public trust. A public charge or employment. It 
is an elected public office.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Tennessee, the office of sheriff is a constitutional office having 
exclusive powers, authority and responsibility. The sheriff is not appointed by 
a government body, but is elected by the people and is responsible to the people 
and not subordinate to county administrators or other elected officials. The 
sheriff is the only law enforcement position that is selected directly by and 
accountable to the citizens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sheriffs and their deputies provide public safety service by mandate 
or tradition.</strong><b><br>
<strong>Today's sheriffs are responsible for protecting human life, the public 
peace and order, the protection of the rights of individuals and their property, 
the prevention of crime and the enforcement of laws without discrimination.</strong></b></p>
<p><strong>Over the years, the law enforcement profession has become very 
sophisticated, as citizens have come to rely on us for more and more 
intervention and protection. The types of crimes and the criminals have become 
more complex and the system has become overburdened attempting to meet the need 
in traditional ways.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today, more than ever, sheriffs need the support of citizens to 
maintain the livability and safety of our communities.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: green">The Difference Between 
The Office Of Sheriff And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Police Department</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the Sheriff's Office and the Police 
Department?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To most people, the distinction is unclear at best, and at 
worst the citizens have no knowledge of the office. There are many differences 
as well as similarities. In the state of Maryland there is an Office of the 
Sheriff for each county and one for Baltimore City. In many counties, the 
Sheriff's Office is the provider of primary law enforcement duties. In 
jurisdictions, which have police departments, the Office of Sheriff provides 
services to the Courts.</strong><b><br>
<br>
<strong>&gt;From early history, Sheriffs have been enforcing laws, protecting 
citizens and enforcing the will of King and Court. It is here the powers of the 
Sheriff originated in English Common Law, which has been absorbed into American 
Common Law and subsequently into the Constitution of the state of Tennessee.
</strong></b></p>
<p><strong>The Office of Sheriff's primary obligation is to represent the 
sovereignty, authority, and interests of the State it’s respective 
jurisdiction&quot;, whereas a Police Department represents the interests of the local 
jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Originally the Sheriff was the King's man, representing the interests 
and authority of the King in his Shire, often controlled by noblemen not always 
sympathetic or loyal to the King. In preserving the rights of the government, he 
(the Sheriff) represents the sovereignty of the state (Tennessee) and has no 
superior in his county. </strong><b><br>
<br>
<strong>The modern Office of Sheriff carries with it all of the common law 
powers, duties and responsibilities to preserve the peace, enforce the laws and 
arrest and commit to jail felons and other infractors of the law. The powers and 
duties of the Sheriff are analogous to those imposed upon police departments. 
The Sheriff is the principle conservator of the peace within the county.</strong></b></p>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 24pt; COLOR: red">History of Dickson County:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>As early as 1790, James Robertson had explored the area that would 
later become Dickson County, determining that the northern part of the county 
was rich in ore. Iron ore could be detected on the surface in some areas, and 
unearthed with minimum excavation in others. By 1793 Robertson had established 
an iron furnace in the northern part of the county. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1793 Robert Bell became the first permanent resident of Dickson 
County, settling on Jones Creek in the northern part of the County</strong></p>
<p><strong>By 1803, Montgomery Bell, John Nesbitt, Abraham Caldwell, and James 
Richard Napier had settled on Bartons Creek. Christopher Strong, Molten Dickson, 
James Martin and Robert Harper had settled on Jones Creek, and Johnson's Creek 
had been settled by George Tubbs, and William Ward. Turnbull Creek was populated 
by Mihnor Bibb, Edward Tidwell, John Brown, Milton Johnson and William and 
Thomas gentry, while William Hogins and Thomas Petty had staked claims on Piney 
River. </strong></p>
<p><strong>County formed from Montgomery and Robertson Counties on October 25, 
1803. The first county and circuit courts are held in James Nesbitt's home in 
near Charlotte.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first county elections are held&nbsp;and Charlotte becomes the county 
seat in 1804.</strong></p>
<p><strong>County named after William Dickson. Dickson never lived in county 
named after him. He was a Nashville physician and statesman who was born in 
Dublin County, NC in 1770. By 1795 he had studied medicine and established a 
practice in Nashville. In&nbsp; 1799, Dickson was speaker of the State House of 
Representatives, serving in Congress from 1801 to 1807. He died in Nashville in 
1816</strong></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><strong>Dickson County was formed on October 25, 1803. 
Land grants date as early as 1786. The early settlements were along the creek 
bottoms of Jones creek, Yellow Creek and Bartons Creek. About 1793 a large 
section of land on Jones Creek was granted to Robert Bell. In February of the 
same year, the Cumberland Furnace, the earliest furnace in the west, was started 
by James Robertson. Robertson later sold the furnace to Montgomery Bell. The 
first county and circuit courts were held at the home of James Nesbitt, on 
Bartons Creek, a few miles from Charlotte. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1804 a commission was appointed to find a site for the county 
seat. The 50 acres that Charles Stewart offered to donate for a county seat were 
accepted by the commission. The town was named Charlotte in honor of James 
Robertson's wife. In 1806 it became the county seat. In 1907, the first post 
office in the county was established in Charlotte. Molton Dickson was the first 
postmaster. Tracy Academy, a noted educational institution, was established 
there before 1830. Between 1810 and 1812 the county buildings were completed and 
for the next 20 to 25 years Charlotte was a place of much importance. From 1819 
to 1821 the state Supreme Court held regular sessions there. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1894 a Socialist Colony was established in Dickson County. J.A. 
Wayland of Greensburg, Indiana, located a corporation at Tennessee City and 
began printing a periodical entitled &quot;The Coming Nation&quot;, which had been 
established in 1893 in Greensburg. Dissension arose and Wayland went away, but 
those of the colony who remained secured a site on Yellow Creek at Cave Mills, 
six miles north of Tennessee City. Under new leadership they began operating 
again, continued the publication, and named the enterprise &quot;The Ruskin 
Cooperative Association&quot;. Dissension, however, rose again, a legal battle ensued 
and the effort ended. The majority of the colony removed to Duke, Georgia.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dickson County is composed of primarily six incorporated towns: 
Burns, Charlotte, Dickson, Slayden, Vanleer and White Bluff. Each of these towns 
has contributed to the success of the county. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dickson County continues to be an area rich in history and tradition. 
The county is also experiencing rapid change and growth. In the census of 1980, 
the population of Dickson County was 30037 and that figure rose to 35061 in the 
1990 census. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dickson County is named for Dr. William Dickson, a Nashville 
physician who served as speaker of the state House of Representatives from 1799 
to 1801 and was elected to Congress in 1801 and served until 1807.&nbsp;</strong></p>
