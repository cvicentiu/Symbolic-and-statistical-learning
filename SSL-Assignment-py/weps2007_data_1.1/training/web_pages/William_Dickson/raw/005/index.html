<P align="justify"><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 11pt">As William Dickson, Edison's loyal colleague, David Storch puts an honorable and human face on the competitive and occasionally ruthless world of scientific and technical discovery.
</font></P>
<P align="justify"><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 11pt">"Dickson did so much work for Edison, and in the end, as happens in the film, left on unhappy terms. I don't think 'betrayed' is too strong a word to describe his feelings," says Storch. "The key to Dickson is to remember his devotion to science, how passionate he was in his search for the truth. I think all these guys - Henry Ford, Adam Smith, Edison, Dickson - were screwed-up individuals, but, when all is said and done, their life's work was to improve the lot of the average Joe."

<P align="justify"><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 11pt">David Storch was born in Montreal. His parents' careers (his father is a social worker; his mother, Janet Storch, a renowned Ph.D. in the field of bioethics) moved the family to Edmonton. There Storch, having written and directed plays in high school, studied drama at the University of Alberta before returning to Montreal when he was accepted by the National Theatre School. Within days of graduation, he landed a gig directing Total Eclipse at a theatre in North Bay, then got his first professional acting job in the Huron County Playhouse production of Babes in Arms. "Those two jobs led to a whole bunch of other stuff. In retrospect," he says of his fast start, "I was very lucky." There have been a handful of film and TV credits (Street Legal, The Valour and the Horror, Atom Egoyan's Gross Misconduct, among others), but for the most part, Storch has specialized in stage roles from coast to coast over the past decade. Among his favorites have been Lloyd's Prayer at the Prairie Theatre Exchange ("it's a very funny play about a feral child raised by raccoons"); Killer's Head at the Manitoba Theatre Centre ("a very disturbing 7-1/2 minute Sam Shepherd play about a man waiting to be executed"); his Joe Pitt role in Angels in America at Canadian Stage; and two plays directed by Neil Munro: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (the national tour in which he played Hyde) and the Mirvish production of The Glass Menagerie (in which he played the Gentleman Caller).

<P align="justify"><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 11pt">Once David Devine had tapped him for the role of Dickson in Edison: The Wizard of Light, Storch says, "I found all the research I could - books, photographs, old film footage - and discovered what an exciting story the Edison story really was. In this one five-year period, they were working like dogs, side by side, inventing so many things, so proud of what they were doing. And yet there was tension between them." After wrapping his part, Storch moved to Vancouver for a year's stint as artistic associate at the Vancouver Playhouse, where he also earned rave reviews for his performance as Einstein in Steve Martin's Picasso at the Lapin Agile. His plans for the remainder of 1998 include playing Iago for director Michal Langham in the Atlantic Theatre Festival's production of Othello and, back in B.C. again, directing the Pulitzer Prize-winning play 

How I Learned to Drive at the Belfry Theatre in Victoria. </font></P>
