An update on u.s. government efforts to develop a framework for global electronic commerce      Due to the explosive growth in the daily use of the Internet throughout the world, the United States government assembled an interagency task force  to  prepare  a  strategy  to  stimulate  the   growth           of global commerce across the Internet.  Over the past eight months, this task group, comprised of more than 20 federal agencies and chaired by Ira C. Magaziner, Senior Advisor to President Clinton for Policy Development, prepared a draft policy to formulate principles that guide policy development   and  outline   the   Clinton   Administration’s  position on key issues related to electronic commerce.  It also provides a road map for international negotiations.  According to the executive summary of the paper, “The Administration believes that widespread competition and increased consumer participation in marketplace choices, not government regulation, should be the defining features of the new digital age.”      According to the Clinton Administration, the need for the policy stems from the lack of a predictable legal environment governing electronic transactions.  In addition, the Administration is concerned about contract enforcement, intellectual property protection, liability, privacy and security.  The general public shares these concerns and many consumers are wary about conducting business in cyberspace.  The Framework for Global Electronic Commerce, proposed by the White House, discusses the commercial implications of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII), and outlines and defines the principles for policy development support.  It also creates a road map to assist international trading partners in the development of a free and open global electronic marketplace.  Global trade in services accounts for over $40 billion of U.S. exports (including software, entertainment and information products, and professional services), and electronic commerce has the potential to dramatically reduce transaction costs and produce new types of commercial transactions for global trade.        The following is a sample of the major policy recommendations made in the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce: Fostering the Internet as a Non-Regulatory, Market Driven Medium — establishing cyberspace as a duty-free zone, advocating  for no new taxes on the Internet, allowing electronic payment systems to evolve without premature government involvement, encouraging industry self regulation where appropriate, and establishing market forces to drive the development of technical standards. Allowing Competition and Consumer Choice to Shape the Marketplace — maintaining privacy and the integrity of personal information, fostering fair competition and striving for interoperability among national telecommunications systems, empowering consumers to manage questions of content; and opposing non-tariff barriers which limit free trade across the Internet, such as content restrictions, discriminatory telecommunications regulations, standards requirements, or anti-competitive compulsory licensing requirements.

ASC X12 LAUNCHES FULL SPEED AHEAD IN NCVHS MEETINGS TO ENSURE X12 STANDARDS ARE INCLUDED IN NEW HEALTH CARE LAW      An Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 campaign to ensure that X12 standards are selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the Administrative Simplification Subtitle F of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, launched full speed ahead at the start of the new year.        Under Subtitle F, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to adopt standards for specified transactions to enable health information to be exchanged electronically.  In January, ASC X12 member and Electronic Commerce Specialist Gary A. Beatty testified on behalf of the Mayo Clinic before the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics’ (NCVHS) Subcommittee on Health Data Needs, Standards and Security with respect  to X12 support of future and current use of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ASC X12 standards.   The NCVHS will submit recommendations to the HHS Secretary during 1997.  This meeting was the first of two public meetings scheduled by NCVHS to obtain the concerns, views and perspectives of interested and affected parties.        At a second meeting on Feb. 11, ASC X12N Insurance Subcommittee Chair Leon Barrett outlined the ASC X12 transactions that are equivalent to what is stipulated in the health care act.      Based on Beatty’s testimony, the Committee heard resounding support for the ANSI X12 standards, except for use within the pharmacy industry for claims processing, where the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standards are currently used.         According to Beatty, X12 has developed transactions to meet each requirement identified in the Act, as well as data requirements for coordination of benefits.  “Our [Mayo Clinic] implementation [of X12 standards] has demonstrated lower implementation costs, shorter startup times and streamlined administrative  processes . . . We realize there will be costs involved with converting our proprietary formatted transactions such as the National Standard Format and the UB92 flat file format to the X12 standards for health care claim . . . We believe these costs will be overshadowed by the savings potential of electronic commerce.”      “To meet the needs of all stakeholders, these standards should be developed and maintained within ANSI ASC X12.  This committee is chartered to meet all business needs and requirements in an open and public environment,” said Beatty as he concluded his testimony.        At the February meeting, Barrett addressed the ASC X12 and ANSI process saying, “As you may already know, ANSI does not develop standards themselves; however, they accredit other organizations to develop them through various designation such as ASC or ASO and there are others.  They foster a process of consensus, public and private sector involvement and a structured process of approvals and quality assurance.”      The advantages of using ASC X12 Insurance Subcommittee transactions were outlined by Barrett.  He stated that they (1) provide for greater visibility of the approved standards that have been developed which address all the transactions considered in the legislation; (2) provide the opportunity to incorporate the standards developed into the healthcare environment and achieve the benefits of reducing administrative cost, hassle factor, time delays and many others to achieve the projected WEDI savings of $8-20 billion annually; and (3) the transactions will enable the health care industry to achieve a national consensus regarding how health care will be administered in this country.        Barrett said, “We currently do not have any concerns with the process that the subcommittee is using to develop its recommendations.  We support the subcommittee in soliciting input from the broadest spectrum of industry stakeholders.  The timelines outlined in the legislation are aggressive, however, we hope that the subcommittee will continue on its current implementation schedule and set realistic time frames for all stakeholders.”  He added that Administrative Simplification can best be achieved by working with the appropriate industry organizations to augment industry implementation; incorporating and endorsing standards already developed by the appropriate ANSI approved standard developing organizations to expedite implementation; developing a partnership between the public and private sectors to address issues and to increase overall awareness by providing educational training to those organizations and individuals who require it; and finally, assisting in the development and review of implementation guides and other appropriate documentation.        Several white papers have been developed by the X12 Insurance Subcommittee outlining processes such as the development of industry implementation guidelines and version control.  Consensus approval of the full committee as well as public review of the implementation guides is required for all standards.  The proposed Administrative Simplification rules on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Subtitle F, are expected to be published in the Federal Register this summer.
