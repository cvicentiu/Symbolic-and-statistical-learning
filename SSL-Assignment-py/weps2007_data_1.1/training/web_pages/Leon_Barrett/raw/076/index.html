<Font class="mainheadlink">West Ham sign Quashie</font><BR>

<font class="byline">Afp, London</font><br><br>
West Ham have signed West Brom midfielder Nigel Quashie in a 1.5-million-pound deal rising to two million if the struggling London side avoids relegation. <P>West Brom manager Tony Mowbray confirmed on Monday: "Nigel recently expressed an interest in getting back to the Premier League. <P>"When West Ham lodged their interest in signing Nigel, coupled with my desire to create some revenue to bring in fresh faces, I thought it was an opportunity which suited all parties." <P>Quashie joined the Baggies from Southampton in a 1.2-million-pound deal minutes before last January's transfer window closed. <P>The 28-year-old made 30 appearances for The Championship club, scoring once in a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal in April. <P>Quashie's departure will give Mowbray extra spending power to press on with his own plans to bring in new blood during the January transfer window. <P>He is set to lodge a four-million-pound bid for the Hibernian midfield duo of Scott Brown and Kevin Thompson from his former club. <P>And Mowbray is also keen to bring the Luton pair of striker Rowan Vine and defender Leon Barrett to The Hawthorns. He is anxious to hold onto his big-name players, most notably skipper Curtis Davies, but Albion have midfield options already at their disposal to compensate for the departure of Quashie.
