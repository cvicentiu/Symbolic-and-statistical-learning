<h1>Camera interpolation</h1>

<p> If controlling a single camera is difficult, constructing a camera
path is even more so. The traditional approach is to specify a
sequence of key frames, then interpolate from one key frame to the
next. This works well for some camera motions, but can produce
unexpected results for certain motions. A simultaneous <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cmg/content/movies/tog2005ci/TRExample.mp4">rotation and translation</a> can
result in the object of interest flying off of the screen. A <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cmg/content/movies/tog2005ci/COPExample.mp4">center of projection</a> change
results in substantial jitter as well.

<p> <IMG src = "tog2005ci.jpg" align="left"> We present two solutions to
the camera interpolation problem. The first uses <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cmg/content/papers/jgt2006ci/jgt2006ci.pdf">linear matrix interpolation</a> to
interpolate the camera matrices. The interpolation can be a linear
interpolation, a spline-weighted blend, or an interpolating blend. The
second approach performs the interpolation in <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cmg/content/papers/tog2005ci/tog2005ci.pdf">image space</a>.

<p> Image-space interpolation also provides additional control over
the trajectories and sizes of selected objects in screen space. This
lets the user use far <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cmg/content/movies/tog2005ci/TradVsIS.mp4">fewer</a>
key frames. To support image-space interpolation we developed the
Four-point camera representation, which is more suited to solving image-space constraint problems.

<h2> Image-space interpolation movies </h2>

<p> The first three movies demonstrate the different behaviour of
three different image-space solvers and traditional key framing. The
next two movies demonstrate directly editing the camera using
image-space constraints.
