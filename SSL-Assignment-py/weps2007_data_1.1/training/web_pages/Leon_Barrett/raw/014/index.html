Source information for research on the B.B. Barrett family, I submit the following information;  
   <p>  "freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~barrettbranches/JosephBarrett/bartley", page 1 of 4:<p>
#1)  "Maude Barrett d. 22 Nov 1882  Dau. of R.G. & C.A. Barrett."     
       <p>   Maude appears to be the result of a transcription error when this inscription was published in the 1987 book, Neshoba County Cemetery Records compiled by Neshoba Co. Historical Society, pub. by Gregath Co, Cullman, ALA, p. 366, BARRETT CEMETERY.   The entry was duplicated in the 2nd Neshoba County Cemetery book, Our Links To The Past . . . pub. 1998 by Neshoba Co. Public Library, T. Ridout, Editor, page 11.
        <p>  A photo of this tombstone reported as Maude's, taken in Oct 1996, reveals the inscribed name is Manda, dau. of R.G. & C.A. Barrett   Died Nov 22, 1882, age (9  ?) Yrs, 10 Mos & 20 Days.  
        <p>  Mr. G.D. Therrell's Barrett Cemetery survey published in The Neshoba Democrat newspaper, Philadelphia, MS, on 15 Jan 1976 lists "Manda"  daughter of R.G. & C.A. Barrett, 1882. (I mailed a copy of this article to you 29 Oct 02 along with other papers which you should receive tomorrow.)  
         <p>The 1880 Neshoba Co, MS census (ED 59, Bt 4, line 45) p. 34, lists Reuben G. Barrett, 25; Chestine A., 22, wife; Bulah B., 6, dau;  Amanda C., 4, dau; and James, 1, son.  So, in 1880 Amanda C. was age 4 (born 1876); she lived to Nov 1882 and was 6 yrs old at death. Perhaps--but I cannot tell from the photo--the tombstone should have read "6" yrs, not "9".  The question is, was there ever a Maude?  Or was she a clerical error?
<p>
#2)  "B.B.'s sons John and Leroy are buried in Barrett Cemetery as well."    
     <p>  John yes, Leroy NO.   A photo sent Janet 28 Oct 2002 of Emma and Leroy's double tombstone was taken at Black Jack Baptist Cemetery near the Pearl River Choctaw Indian Reservation Headquarters a few years ago.  Mr. Leroy chose to be buried at Black Jack rather than White Oak or Oak Grove for personal reasons known to his granddaughter of Carthage, MS.  See page 31, Our Links to the Past . . . for Leroy, Emma and three of their children, Arnold, Gertha and Shelton Barrett, all buried at Black Jack.  I have been there numerous times.  Leroy and Emma's daughter Coley is buried at Barrett Cemetery.

#3)  "Johnnie Leon Barrett b. 1903 MS - d. 1943 AR.  He married Nettie Breazeale.  She is buried at White Oak, and he may also be buried there, the Leon listed has the wrong dates.  . . ."
     <p>  The Leon Barrett buried at White Oak Cem, Neshoba Co, MS (p. 473, Links to the Past) was son of Leroy and Emma Clark Barrett.  He was born 1 April 1908-d. 29 Mar 1970.  This Leon married Nettie Estell Breazeale in Oct 1927, Neshoba Co, MS.  They had three children (I know of):  Hardie Randolph, 29 March 1937-26 May 1949; son Charles Lee Barrett who m-1 Dollie Moore; and dau. Marie Barrett.  I called Leon's niece last night, 29 Oct 02,  to verify that this info is correct.  She and Marie were close growing up.  She said Leon was just a little older than her mother who was born in 1910.
   <p>  Johnnie Leon, b. 1903, was Willie E. and Minnie E. Byrd Barrett's son.  Tracie Hoines has a photo of Willie, wife Minnie, and their two children, son Johnnie LEON and daughter Nannie PEARL Barrett.  Dau. Pearl was older than Johnnie Leon.  The photo probably was made about 1905.  Tracie Hoines in a letter  dated 8 April 2001 to Ann Lila writes:  "Leon died in the 1930's, she (his wife) remarried."   
<p>
#4)  "ii.  Mary Catherine Barrett "Kate" b. Nov l888 in MS.  Kate m. (1) Berry Griffin, iii.  Martha J. V. "Viola" Barrett b. Jan 1890 in MS.  Viola m. (1) Latham Brookshire,  (2) Robert Latham,  (3) C.O. Brookshire"
      <p> Martha J. Viola BARRETT,  (15 June 1890-30 Dec 1978)  married 1st, ROBERT L. LATHAM, 7 Oct 1920, Neshoba Co, MS (Src: CD-5).  He was b. 20 Apr 1864, d. 26 Oct 1938.
      <p> Martha J. Viola married 2nd, after Oct 1938, C.O. BROOKSHIRE.  She and both husbands were buried at Riverdale Cem, Columbus,  Muscogee Co, GA.  Her GA Death Certificate shows she had resided in Columbus, GA, for 55 years.  (Src: Tracie Hoines)
      <p> Added item of interest from Leroy Barrett's granddaughter about 1993:  "Grandfather had a little house built near his home for Kate and her husband so Kate could help care for Leroy and Emma in their later years.
