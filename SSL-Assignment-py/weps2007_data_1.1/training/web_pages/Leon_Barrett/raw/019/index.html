        <p>The rumors have been out there for weeks, spread through Internet
        chat rooms and message boards or by old-fashioned word of mouth. They
        caught up with John Munson, John Allen's father, last Friday night at
        Coatesville (Pa.) High -- Allen's alma mater -- when Munson took in the
        Coatesville-Chester district playoff game.
        <p>&quot;Guys were coming up to me and saying, 'Is John going to
        Maryland? Is he going here (another school)?'&quot; Munson said.</p>

        The perception that freshman forward Allen and sophomore point guard
        Andre Barrett, the foundation of Seton Hall's future, may transfer after
        a turbulent 12-18 season poses the biggest off-season dilemma for the
        Pirates. Losing either would be devastating for first-year coach Louis
        Orr and the program, especially given the strength of New Jersey high
        school juniors considering the Hall, Seton Hall Prep's Jamar Nutter
        among them.
        <p>For now, Barrett says he isn't going anywhere. &quot;I'm not going to
        transfer or anything like that,&quot; Barrett said Wednesday night after
        the Hall's seventh consecutive loss, a 64-58 loss to St. John's in the
        first round of the Big East Tournament, ensured its first season without
        an NCAA Tournament or NIT appearance since 1997-98.</p>
        <p>Allen also pledged to stay, then hedged.</p>
        <p>&quot;I'm on the ship,&quot; Allen said. &quot;I'm not going to jump
        off the ship when it's going down. I'm not going to do that.</p>
        <p>&quot;If I decide to transfer, if it comes up in my mind ... right
        now, I'm not thinking about it. I'm going to work, try to get better,
        and try to make Seton Hall better. That's my plan right now.&quot;</p>
        <p>A season brimming with controversies and discord, from ill-timed
        player comments to the George Jackson/Desmond Herod film-session
        scuffle, has basketball intelligentsia speculating about the future of
        both players. Each would have to sit out one season if they transfer,
        two within the Big East. Orr was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Both players were Tommy Amaker recruits; Allen signed a letter of
        intent before Amaker departed for Michigan and would have been forced to
        sit out two seasons if he reneged.</p>
        <p>Both bought into Orr's motion offense and scrappy defensive
        philosophy. Barrett led the team in scoring (16.9 points), assists
        (5.03) and minutes (34.5) while turning into Orr's most vocal supporter.
        Allen, an Orr favorite who took Marcus Toney-El's starting job, finished
        third on the team in scoring (11.4) and second in rebounding (5.5).</p>
        <p>But neither expected the team to flounder like it did, especially
        after the Hall nearly beat Duke in the second game of the season at the
        Maui Invitational.</p>
        <p>&quot;I'm hearing all the rumors,&quot; Munson said. &quot;It's not
        coming from his mother's mouth, my mouth or his mouth. We sit down and
        discuss everything, and the only discussing has been summer school.
        Right now, our objective is staying where we are.&quot;</p>
        <p>However, Munson said his son's future is linked to Barrett's.</p>
        <p>&quot;When Amaker left, if we had a point guard, we were
        staying,&quot; Munson said. &quot;If not, we were going to do what we
        had to do. We had a point guard, and we stayed. We still have a point
        guard, as far as I know.&quot;</p>
        <p>Leon Barrett, Andre's father, said the Hall still does.</p>
        <p>&quot;(Transferring) is out of the question,&quot; the elder Barrett
        said. &quot;Last year, when Amaker left, we seriously considered it.
        When he made the decision to stay, that meant, whatever happened, he had
        to accept it. I don't like him bouncing back and forth when things are
        going bad.</p>
        <p>&quot;As much as I'd like to see him play in the NCAAs, how he deals
        with all this will help him and make him more of a man in the long run.
        And he's not going to run out on Andre Sweet.&quot;</p>
        <p>The 6-6 Sweet, Barrett's teammate at Rice High School in New York
        City and his current roommate, transferred from Duke and is eligible
        next year.</p>
