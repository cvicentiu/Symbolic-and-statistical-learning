			Problems with the HIPAA chain of trust and business partner agreements are among the thorniest of the HIPAA regulations, yet the value of HIPAA-covered entities in their marketplaces depends on meeting the challenges to comply with these agreements. HealthLeaders.com member Michael Doscher reviews key clauses for contemplated business partner agreements, related issues and recommendations for compliance.

	To greatly minimize the risks of sharing protected healthcare information (PHI), HIPAA-covered entities and their business partners must comply with provisions of the proposed security and privacy rules.  The provisions regarding third party processing of PHI will necessitate significant new or revised trading partner agreements, along with new related policies and procedures.<br><br>The intents of the provisions are not in dispute.  They reflect good business practices in a sensitive healthcare environment.  Ensuring the end-to-end protection and privacy of PHI will enhance the value of covered entities in the eyes of their communities, members and patients.<br><br>However, the provisions left many related issues unresolved.  The proposed security rule did not flesh out the terms of a chain of trust agreement nor did it anticipate the privacy provisions.  In fact, its sole example involved a hypothetical relationship between two covered entities that must comply with the security provisions anyway.  In contrast, the proposed privacy provisions were more extensive and anticipated the entire spectrum of third party relationships, but they were not clear about the application of the security and confidentiality provisions.<br><br>This article will review the key clauses for contemplated business partner agreements, related issues and recommendations for compliance.<br><br>The proposed security rule requires a "chain of trust partner agreement," whereas the proposed privacy rule spells out the general terms of a "business partner contractual agreement."  These are overlapping concepts but with different emphases.  The chain of trust focuses on the protected exchange of patient-identifiable healthcare data, while the business partner agreement addresses potential privacy violations associated with the use and disclosure of shared PHI.  Most HIPAA authorities agree that the soon-to-be published security and privacy rules will reflect a consolidated set of business partner agreement terms.<br><br>In the healthcare industry, there are many forms of business relationships.  Typical partnerships include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>
</p><p>
<ul><li>Vendor relationships such as:<ol><li>Information Technology><li>Suppliers<li>Consultant, including auditors<li>Outsourcing agreements binding outsourcer to expressed and implied industrial performance standards<li>Clearinghouse, claims, statement and third party administrator processors requiring technical specifications for the exchange of PHI<li>Billing collections agencies<li>Medical transcriptions<li>Attorney<li>Internet content and application providers</ol><li>Joint ventures<li>Alliances and affiliations<li>Medical services, which can be extremely complex but assumedly do not address the security and privacy of PHI<li>Private accreditation organizations</ul></p><p>
</p><p>
Most of the common relationships necessitate sharing of PHI, often without consideration of the security and privacy of the information.  As can be noted in the above list, many of the contracted partners are not HIPAA-covered entities.  Moreover, some of the relationships are significantly downstream from a given covered entity responsible for the PHI.  Only the proposed privacy provisions attempt to tackle those "down-stream" relationships between non-covered entities processing PHI.  The principal considerations are reviewed below.<br><br><br><b>Key considerations</b><br><br>It appears that HIPAA security and privacy authorities are already blending the chain of trust and business partner agreement into one set of general guidelines.  For instance, Foley, Hoag and Eliot in HCPro's HIPAA Weekly AdvisorÂ© and the Security Summit's January 26, 2000, "Draft HIPAA Security Summit Guidelines" document similar broadened chain of trust guidelines.   Davis, Wright, Tremaine proposes standard contract points in a document drafted for the Los Angeles HIPAA Forum entitled "Preliminary Guidelines for Business Partner/Chain of Trust Agreements."  Many of the points included in the above documents are interpreted below.<br><br>The key considerations for chain of trust business partner agreements include:</p><p>
</p><p>
<ul><li>The covered entity binds the business partner (BP) to abide by the current and future HIPAA security, confidentiality and privacy standards regarding PHI.  The agreement would cite the relevant HIPAA business partner provisions.<li>The agreement between the parties limits use and disclosure of PHI to what is permitted in the agreement or contract.<li>A BP must similarly bind their BPs.<li>The terms should limit the sharing of PHI to that which is minimally necessary.<li>The agreement should address the procedures the parties will follow once the PHI is no longer useful depending on the nature of their relationship.<li>The agreement needs to consider sanctions regarding violations of the agreement.<li>The covered entity should consider serious sanctions upon violation of the security and privacy provisions.<li>The agreement needs to leave open the possibility to amend and update the terms as HIPAA regulations evolve.</ul></p><p>
</p><p>
The objective of the proposed terms is to apply the same level of compliance to both the covered entity and all business partners linked by the PHI.<br><br><br><b>Issues</b><br><br>Subsequent final security and privacy rules may resolve the following issues:</p><p>
</p><p>
<ul><li><i>Are HIPAA-defined business partner agreements necessary between covered entities? </i>  The proposed chain of trust provisions suggests that they are.  Undoubtedly, in order to do business together, the two covered entities have executed a contract defining their relationship; however, they are by mandate both required to comply with the HIPAA provisions.<li><i>How can the covered entity certify that their chain of trust business agreements are HIPAA compliant? </i>  The proposed privacy rule goes much further than the security rule in defining compliance, but among other issues, it did not clarify its relationship to the security provisions' chain of trust agreement.<li><i>Can the contracting parties agree to a compact set of umbrella clauses binding the parties to the rules?</i>  Or do they need to identify key security and privacy components pertinent to the nature of their relationship?<li><i>Although it is clearly intended that the burden of enforcement fall on the covered entity, how far out on the chain does their responsibility extend?</i><li><i>How does the covered entity confirm third party compliance?</i>  The covered entity needs to routinely monitor how well their partners are complying with the HIPAA standards.  If they reasonably suspect that a partner is non-compliant, they must enforce the related agreement. Can they, as a result, require on-site certifications of compliance?<li><i>Will business arrangements with diagnostic affiliates require a chain of trust business partner agreement?</i>  Providers are generally exempted from having to comply with the business partner agreement provisions while treating patients.  They must, nevertheless, comply with security, confidentiality and privacy provisions.</ul></p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Recommendations</b><br><br>Thorough compliance with HIPAA regulations requires enterprise-wide participation.  In particular, to ensure secure and private transactions with all affected business partners, organizations need to undertake the following:</p><p>
</p><p>
<ul><li>Include counsel in any HIPAA assessment; empower them to understand the HIPAA regulations and resolve the still outstanding issues.  They should become aware of the eventual availability of model agreements through professional societies, forums of industry leaders or law firms with a HIPAA practice.<li>Identify all third party relationships.<li>Assess the need for chain of trust business partner agreements based on the nature of the relationship; Consider simple umbrella terms in low risk relationships.  Otherwise, use tailored terms based on the key considerations outlined above.<li>Use best security practices for those third parties accessing PHI on one's own host systems.<li>Insist on open third party site assessments, on-going compliance reporting and complete disclosure depending on the nature of the relationship.<li>Amend agreements to include the most stringent healthcare industry privacy policies after ensuring HIPAA compliance.<li>Amend all existing and interim business partner contracts to include HIPAA compliance requirements.</ul></p><p>
</p><p>
There are obvious challenges to implementing chain of trust business partner agreements.  Most of the HIPAA provisions reflect good business practices, which should already be incorporated in existing contracts.  Organizations committed to adopting the best security and privacy policies will derive both a trusted relationship and competitive advantage within their community.</p><p>
