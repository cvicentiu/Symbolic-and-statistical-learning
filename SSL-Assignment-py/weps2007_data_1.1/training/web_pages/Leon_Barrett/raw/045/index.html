p. 69 Figure 5.2 (Source: Buccino et al. <i>Eur J Neurosci</i>, 2001.)<br>
Figure 5.2 on page 69 is a monochrome rendering (by Leon Barrett) of the summary Figure 4 here. The top Figure 1 depicts fMRI pre-motor activation while viewing mouth action. The lower images show the additional parietal activation when an object of action is present. Figure 2 shows the same for hand actions and Figure 3 for foot action. In Figure 4, mouth action is shown as red, hand action as green and foot as blue.
