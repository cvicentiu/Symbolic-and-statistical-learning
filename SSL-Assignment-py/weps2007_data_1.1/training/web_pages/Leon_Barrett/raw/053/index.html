            <br>
            At the initiative of Vernie 
            Green, on June 6, 1985, five past students of the St. Elizabeth Technical 
            High School in Santa Cruz, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, met and formed 
            the STETHS Past Students Association of Canada. They were: 
            <p />
            </font>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">(1) Garry Bent who was elected 
              president. He served as president from 1985 to 1990.<br />
              (2) Vernie Green who was elected co-ordinator. At a later date he 
              served as public relations officer.<br />
              (3) Clem Blair who was elected vice president. He is presently the 
              activities co-ordinator.<br />
              (4) Dee Blake who was elected treasurer. He is presently the president, 
              serving since 1990.<br />
              (5) Leon Barrett who was elected secretary. He is presently the secretary/treasurer. 
              <br>
              <br>            
              Since our formation over 
              15 years ago, others have come on board. They have made and some are 
              still making their significant contributions to the continued existence 
              of our association. I will attempt to list these fellow past students. 
              If I miss anyone, be assured it was not intentional. If such persons 
              will contact us, we will make amends.<br>
              <br>            
              The persons are Hortell 
              Barham (former activities co-ordinator), Burnice Frazer (presently 
              vice president), Ron Newell, Reggie J. Clarke (former teacher at STETHS), 
              Iolda Fraser, Aaron Harrison (former secretary), Cleve Taylor (former 
              treasurer and public relations officer), Sylvan Lalor (former vice 
              president), Jean Reynolds, Patricia Porter, Lorna Jones, Lorna Jhagroo, 
              Pauline McKitty-Robinson, Evadne Scarlett and Wesley Parchment. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Since our formation, we 
              have been working on two sets of activities - one to benefit our alma 
              mater and the other in the interest of our organization. For example, 
              we have donated a computer system, sports equipment and money to STETHS. 
              In the last few years, the money we sent has been used to reduce the 
              outstanding debt students owe the school. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In the interest of our children, 
              every year we sponsor a Children's Christmas Party and a summer picnic 
              where presents and prizes are distributed and awarded. We also make 
              a contribution when there is a birth or death in the family. In addition 
              we have been presenting to our children, who are presently enrolled 
              in a post-secondary institution or who have recently graduated from 
              one, funds to encourage them to continue to pursue post-secondary 
              education. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The awards are generally 
              presented at our annual fundraising function in October. The awards 
              are usually presented to past students, children of our regular supporters, 
              and children of past students who are in colleges or universities. 
              As the most progressive alumni association in Greater Toronto, members 
              of our association believe that if our children work their way through 
              secondary school and are motivated to pursue studies at the college 
              and university levels, ALL should be encouraged in a tangible way, 
              not only the brightest and best. The last set of awardees were Robert 
              Blake, Leon Barrett Jr., Dean Barham, Jean Carnegie-Clarke, and Antonette 
              Gentles. Financial contributions to the tertiary education of our 
              children will be an annual event. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Special thanks to our spouses 
              or significant others for their support. On behalf of our association 
              I would also like to pay tribute to the members and their spouses 
              of the former Magnificent 7+. They have been like family to us, supporting 
              our many functions. Special thanks also to Colin Vern who over the 
              years has been and continues to play a significant role in publicizing 
              our events. 
              <br>
              <br>
              A final thank you to all 
              those other persons who have supported us over these years. Your contributions 
              are greatly appreciated. They have enabled us to pursue some of our 
              goals. We hope you will continue to support our many activities.<br> 
              <br />
