     <p>London<br /><br />They deal with life and death every day as they race to help the sick and the wounded. Alex Hannaford spent a gruelling shift with the crew of a Rotherhithe ambulance <br /><br />THE ambulance's onboard computer tells us that a 63-year-old man named Dave has fractured his wrist. Immediately, the crew of Sameenah Din and Leon Barrett switch on their siren and lights to cut through the rush-hour traffic. <br /><br />We are there in under five minutes. <br /><br />Inside, Dave's flat is filthy. A cup of beer sits on a broken table and Dave is sitting on the floor in the doorway to his bedroom. He is clearly inebriated. Leon asks him how much he has had to drink. "A fair bit," he says. <br /><br />After a few minutes, searching for Dave's keys, Leon and Sameenah lead him outside to the ambulance. <br /><br />The vehicle has a powerful V8 engine and you can hear the enormous throaty roar as it powers down the road. It also has satellite navigation with which Sameenah and Leon are getting to grips. <br /><br />Whenever a call comes through it appears on a screen on the dashboard. Leon keeps in touch by pressing a button, depending on their position: "at scene", "on way to hospital" or " at hospital ". <br /><br />Sameenah says this piece of technology really helps. <br /><br />On our way to the hospital, a rapidresponse car zooms past. "They only attend category A call-outs," says Sameenah, who is 27 and comes from west London. <br /><br />"That's when someone's life is in danger. They may have chest pains or be unconscious." <br /><br />Leon says many of their call-outs are to elderly people who have fallen out of bed. There are also three or four maternity calls a day. "It's a real pick and mix," he says. "It depends on the time and the day of the week. <br /><br />Friday and Saturday nights, it's always pub and club brawls." <br /><br />At St Thomas' Hospital, Leon checks Dave into casualty and tells the nurse that the patient is intoxicated and suffers from asthma. <br /><br />"People are seen according to their condition," Sameenah says. "Just because you've called an ambulance doesn't mean you'll get seen first. It costs about 300 every time you call us out. Some people think that just because they have paid their taxes. it gives them legitimacy to call us out for anything, whether it's an emergency or not." <br /><br />Leon says people like Dave make the job more pleasurable. "He was smiling the whole way through and was quite harmless." <br /><br />Back at the station in Rotherhithe, Leon and Sameenah's colleague Bill is deskbound because his fastresponse car has an oil leak and he is waiting for a replacement. Leon tells me you need to have driven an ambulance for two years before you can transfer to the fast-response car. <br /><br />Eighteen months ago, Sameenah was recruiting nurses for Hammersmith Hospital. She saw an ad for an ambulance technician and applied. "It's a misconception that you need a medical or science background," she says. "You learn the driving skills and advanced first aid when you get the job, then you do a five-week stint on the road with an experienced crew supervising you to ease you in." <br /><br />Leon, 41, was a graphic designer for 10 years before he joined the ambulance service. "I was from the old school of graphic design - doing it all by hand: so when it was computerised, I left. I was going through a list of possible jobs and like Sameenah I saw an ad for this job. It was something totally different from what I had been doing. I've now been in the service 10 years." <br /><br />"A lot of people go through a career crisis in their thirties," Sameenah says. "This is a great career choice and you'll be putting something back." <br /><br />However, Sameenah says it is difficult living in London on a salary of around 20,000. The Government offers assistance for key workers when buying property, which she describes as one of the perks of the job. "The irony is that if I was in another job, I could probably afford to buy it off my own back. <br /><br />"But joining the ambulance service is a fantastic thing to do. Just to be let into somebody's house is a privilege. <br /><br />There's such a level of trust: people take you into their confidence." <br /><br />Inside their base, a small Victorian brick building near the Rotherhithe Tunnel, there is just enough time to grab a cola before the phone rings again. "We've got another one," Leon says calmly, but cannot elaborate until he gets into the ambulance and sees the computer. A 92-year-old woman has fallen in her home. It takes us minutes to get to her house. <br /><br />Inside, she is sitting on the floor, supported by two elderly friends. <br /><br />Leon is told she was discharged from Lewisham Hospital only that day and she says she does not want to go back. <br /><br />SAMEENAH and Leon check her blood pressure and pulse, ensure she doesn't have blue lips, understands speech and has mobility. <br /><br />"She is fine," Sameenah says when she returns to the ambulance. "She's just a little shaken, so she didn't go to hospital. It was a slip rather than a fall. We had to use our judgment as to whether it was safe to let her stay at home." <br /><br />But there is no time to rest. A 90-year-old woman in a nearby care home has abdominal pains, and we are off again. Maude is awaiting our arrival, holding her stomach. As she is wheeled out to the ambulance, she asks for her mother and father. <br /><br />"It's terribly sad," Sameenah says. <br /><br />"A lot of old people that we attend to ask for their parents. Everyone thinks we must develop an immunity but we don't. <br /><br />"I think we develop a coping mechanism but she just caught me offguard. I was ready for her to say she didn't want to go to hospital but not for her to ask for her mum and dad." <br /><br />Leon and Sameenah have been on duty for four hours: the time has flown by. <br /><br />As we pull into the station, there is another call. The computer readout says a man has been either stabbed or shot, and kicked in the head by a group of people outside London Bridge Station. We are told he has chest pains and bleeding. <br /><br />To be on the safe side, I am told to put on my "stab vest". Sameenah says you never know who you will be picking up. If it is drink- or drug-related, staff sometimes get attacked. There is a surge of adrenaline as we go to the scene but when we arrive, there is nothing there. <br /><br />A policeman says that a drunk had been injured by a gang but has refused help. Sometimes information gets distorted as it is relayed by members of the public. "The police work well with us," Sameenah says. <br /><br />"They let medical questions take precedence." <br /><br />But she says it is frustrating when some members of the public cannot differentiate between ambulance crew and police. <br /><br />"You'd be surprised," she says. <br /><br />"There are assaults on our staff and sometimes if we attend a nightclub people won't tell us what drugs they've taken because they think we're going to prosecute them. But we are taught what are known as talk-down techniques - how to deal with violent or abusive behaviour." <br /><br />Back at the station the next shift is about to take over from Sameenah and Leon. Within minutes they are called to an attempted suicide. <br /><br />Sameenah says in cases like this there is usually a pretty unpleasant sight awaiting ambulance crews on arrival. <br /><br />"You should come along on a Friday or Saturday night," a paramedic from another crew says, switching on his blue lights and pulling away. <br /><br />"That can get interesting," Sameenah says. "You would be wearing your stab vest all night." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Evening Standard; London (UK) <br />
