<IMG SRC="index.html.1.1.html" alt=A border=0 align=left height=34>t his Deer Lake training camp, in the Blue Mountains of Pennsylvania, Muhammad Ali was summoning the discipline to prepare himself for the ordeal of all-out combat. The 38-year-old fighter was only weeks away from what might finally be the last boxing match of his long career, a world-heavyweight-title fight with Larry Holmes, the current champion. 
<p>
Against the advice of numerous ring-wise counselors, Ali had come out of retirement to seek the heavyweight crown for the fourth time.  (He is already the only fighter ever to hold it three times.) The Holmes fight looms as his most challenging in a quarter-century of ring battles, for Ali is the underdog contender this time, the old man bucking the odds, currently 2 to 1. And the stakes are enormous: When he steps into a Las Vegas ring with Holmes on Thursday night, he will be going for the 57th victory of his 60-fight career - and for a  guaranteed purse of $8 million, an amount that will raise the exchampion's lifetime ring earnings to about $60 million. 
<p>
<p>
<p><p><p><br>
This day, Ali had just finished a heavy workout. He was bone-weary, and craving rest, but to all outward appearances, he seemed unscarred by a lifetime  of formal violence. He had lost 30 pounds since coming to Deer Lake, and his smoothly handsome face and his powerful, polished-walnut physique could have belonged to a weight lifter or a dancer. He didn't look like a man who had made  himself world-famous by conquering all comers with his fists. 
<p>
His voice, too was a surprise. The tirade that had come to characterize his prefight public rhetoric was muted. For a moment, he was not on public display,  and his thoughts were not on his fights but on his family. He spoke softly, just above a whisper: 
<p>
"I never knew much about my ancestors until now. It makes me proud to learn  something about them, about people like Tom Morehead - honest, hard-working people, strong people. When I'm gone, I want my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to give me credit for what I did - and in the same way, I'm  happy to know about my ancestors so I can give them credit." 
<p>
Ali studied a faded photograph of Tom and Lizzie Morehead, two of his great-grandparents. He listened intently as a reporter told him stories of slaves and free blacks who returned to Africa, or fought for the Union in the Civil War, or struggled against racial discrimination after the war. He heard the facts and the circumstantial evidence that linked blacks and whites as victims and aggressors, as friends and enemies, as literal and figurative brothers and sisters. 
<p>
These long-forgotten ancestors penetrated his consciousness. Their lives were a revelation to him. He was fascinated by them, drawn to them. They, too, had fought on against heavy odds, and some of them had prevailed, if only in modest  ways. He sensed a kinship, a connection that bridged the generations. 
<p>
"I've heard about Henry Clay and Cassius Clay, about the slave owners and all," Muhammad Ali said at last. "But this is the first time I've heard much about my black ancestors. I'm proud and honored for them to be recognized. Someday I'd like to dig up everything that can be found about all the people I'm descended from." After two tumultuous decades of national and international exposure, Muhammad Ali is certainly one of the best-known personalities in the world -and, in the eyes of millions, he may also be the most respected. Many rank him the best boxer in history, supporting what Ali himself has long claimed: That he is "the greatest." More than a fighter, he is a global black  hero, a worldwide symbol of black pride and strength. 
<p>
And yet, for all that has been written about Ali, little is known of his ancestry. Sports writers and biographers have told of the brash and cocky black  kid who rose from the segregated streets of Louisville, Ky., to seize attention  in the ring. They have noted that he was born on Jan. 18, 1942, the first son of Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., a sign painter, and Odessa Grady Clay, and that he was given the name of his father. Some writers, pointing to the fact that one of the most notorious white men in 19th-century Kentucky was a firebrand abolitionist and gentleman-warrior named Cassius Marcellus Clay, have suggested  that the Louisville boxer was a worthy successor to the name - and perhaps blood relation of the historical figure as well. One biographer, John Cottrell, also wrote that there was a "family claim" that the young fighter "was the great-greatgrandson of Henry Clay," the famous Kentucky Senator and Presidential candidate of the mid-1800's who tried in vain to lead the nation away from civil war. 
<p>
But those assertions were made without attribution or proof. The gap between  the white Clay family of the 19th-century and Muhammad Ali's father -a gap of at least two generations - was never bridged. 
<p>
When his career was in its early stages, young Clay liked his name, even though he had learned that the Clays had been slave owners.  "Don't you think it's a beautiful name?" he used to say to interviewers. "Say it out loud: Cassius Marcellus Clay." Then, in 1964, he joined the Nation of Islam and became Muhammad Ali, renouncing Cassius Marcellus Clay as "a slave name." His  distressed father's initial response was that his son was "trying to rub that name out, and I'm trying to make it strong." 
<p>
The seriousness of Ali's commitment to his Muslim faith has been frequently tested but never found lacking. Even so, Ali has a sense of humor and irony about his former name. In 1974, during a visit to the Capitol in Washington, he  stood before a statue of Henry Clay and joked, "So that's what the great-great-grandfather looked like." 
<p>
But in his autobiography, "The Greatest, My Own Story," written with Richard Durham in 1975, Ali said there was "very little knowledge, if any, of 'white blood' from any source" in his family, and he added, "If slaveholder Clay's blood came into our veins along with the name, it came by rape and defilement." As for the abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, he may have gotten rid of his slaves, Ali wrote, "but (he) held on to white supremacy." Ali concluded: "Why should I keep my white slavemaster's name visible and my black  ancestors invisible, unknown, unhonored?" 
<p>
(In truth, Cassius Clay's attachment to slavery went farther than Ali knew. In spite of his abolitionist fervor, Clay owned more slaves in 1865, when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution finally forbade its practice, than he had inherited from his father 37 years earlier.) 
<p>
Ali wrote with special fondness in his autobiography of two of his paternal aunts, Coretta and Eva Clay. Coretta is dead now, but Eva Clay Waddell still lives in Louisville, and she remembers with warmth and pride her family's history. 
<p>
"My father was Herman Clay," she said, "and my mother was Edith Greathouse Clay. They were Muhammad Ali's grandparents, and they were still living when he was growing up. I knew my mother's parents, Montgomery and Betsy Jane Greathouse, and I remember my mother's grandmother Patsy, who lived to be 115 years old. But I never knew the names of my father's parents. They both died before I was born.  All I ever heard about them was that my grandmother was a woman from Madagascar, and that she and my grandfather (Muhammad Ali's greatgrandparents) were married in Louisville, and their children were born here, including Herman. 
<p>
(According to the 1880 census, a black man named John Clay, aged 56, lived in Louisville with his wife and nine children, one of whom apparently was Herman.)  
<p>
"My father was 77 when he died about 25 years ago," . Waddell said. "He used to tell us he was a grandson of Henry Clay - said he got teased about it a  lot when he was young, and got into plenty of fights because of it. 
<p>
"No doubt some Clay and Greathouse ancestors were white," she said, "but that doesn't concern me one way or the other. It's nothing to hide. Those things happened back then." 
<p>
Cassius and Odessa Clay, Muhammad Ali's parents, are now separated, but both  of them still live in Louisville. They are sought out frequently by strangers inquiring about their son. As a consequence they are reluctant to enter into conversation about him, or about family matters in general. 
<p>
Odessa Lee Clay was born in Hopkins County in western Kentucky.  Her parents, John Grady and Birdie Morehead Grady, were divorced about 50 years ago, after which . Grady moved to Louisville with her children. There, Odessa eventually met and married Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. 
<p>
Little is known about the Grady side of the family, except that a cousin of Muhammad Ali recalls hearing that John Grady's father was born to a black woman  and a "white Irishman" named Grady, or perhaps O'Grady. 
<p>
But the Moreheads - the parents of Birdie Morehead Grady, the grandparents of Odessa Grady Clay, the great-grandparents of Muhammad Ali - are another story. The Moreheads were special.  Gillie Bell Morehead Plunkett is not certain of her age. She could be 80 - or 90. She has lived in Louisville for almost a half century, but she was born a Morehead in rural Logan County, Ky., 140 miles southwest of Louisville, and she is the keeper of her family's history. 
<p>
"I'm the oldest living grandchild of Tom Morehead," she said.  "He had lots of children - seven by his first wife, six by his second. My father was Virgil Morehead. He belonged to the first set, to Tom Morehead and Georgia Ann Lyons. Birdie Morehead, who was Muhammad Ali's grandmother, belonged to Tom and  his second wife, Lizzie Bibb. I remember my grandfather well - I was a young girl when he died in 1913." 
<p>
. Plunkett recalled the land of her childhood: "Green Ridge, Gordonsville, Bibbtown - they were all little communities close together, running along the Highland Lick Road a few miles out of Russellville, the county seat of Logan County. It was rich land, good soil, and my grandfather owned over 200 acres of it. Part of what he owned was inheritance land, passed to him from  his father's holdings. 
<p>
"My grandfather was half white. I never knew what his father's first name was, but he was a Morehead, a white man, and he had Tom by a slave woman named Dinah. I was always told that. At about the same time, that Morehead man and his white wife had a son named James. Jim and Tom were half brothers - they grew up  together, played together, worked together. They were real close. After Tom married, he named his first son Jim - that was my uncle, my father's brother."  
<p>
. Plunkett searched through a large box full of photographs and family memorabilia, looking for a picture of her grandfather. "Tom Morehead went away and served in the Union Army in the Civil War," she continued, "and I heard him tell of fighting until blood ran like water in the trenches. He wasn't afraid of nothing. He was some nice-looking man, too, the best-looking man I ever saw: tall and straight, light-skinned, had long black curly hair and dimples in each cheek. He carried himself with pride, didn't bow to no man." 
<p>
She found the photograph she was looking for, a tan and tattered picture of two neatly dressed adults and four small, barefooted children gathered around a  lace-draped chair in which infant twins were propped. 
<p>
"That's Tom Morehead and Lizzie Bibb and their six children," she explained. "See the little girl standing close to her father?  That's Birdie -that's Muhammad Ali's grandmother. This picture must have been made soon after  1900, because Birdie looks to be 8 or 9, and I think she was born in 1893." 
<p>
. Plunkett studied the picture for a moment. "My grandfather was right prosperous," she said. "His land was supposed to stay in the family, and it did for a while after he died, but then it got away somehow - white people got it. There's not any Moreheads left around there now, black or white. They've all died, or moved away." 
<p>
The photograph of Tom Morehead and his wife held . Plunkett's attention. "I used to know some white people that claimed kinship to my grandfather," she said after a time, "and they were proud of it. When he died, there was as many  whites as blacks at his funeral.  All his life, Tom Morehead stood high. He was  somebody." 
<p>
On a wall of her sitting room, just above a large television set, . Plunkett has a framed picture of the young Cassius Marcellus Clay. He is poised  in a crouch before a punching bag, and he is wearing a United States Olympic team jacket. She looked up at the picture of her young cousin and smiled. 
<p>
"There's something about Cassius people don't understand, isn't there?" she said. "How did he come to be so famous? When he was little, we never dreamed he'd be famous. But I can remember when he was just a little boy, he'd go around saying, 'I'm gonna be a boxer, and I'm gonna whip everybody.' I told him to hush up, to go on to Sunday school and church and stay out of trouble." 
<p>
She shook her head and laughed. "Maybe he knew what he was talking about all along." Russellville and Logan County are located near the midpoint of a fertile farm belt that stretches for about 100 miles along Kentucky's western border with Tennessee. Land-seeking white men from Virginia and the Carolinas explored and occupied the region 200 years ago, and for generations people of the area have taken great pride in their community's substanial contributions to Kentucky history. 
<p>
Residents of Russellville in particular pay reverent attention to the past. In the years between 1800 and 1860, their town evolved from a rugged frontier village in an outlaw society to a place of some refinement and productivity, and now its shady streets are graced by many fine old houses. Local histories note that the town and county have produced four Kentucky Governors, five governors of other states, five United States Senators, and six Congressmen. (Also claimed are James Bowie, the famous knife-fighter who died at the Alamo, and Robert James, who went with the generous aid of two local bankers to study for the ministry. The latter would hardly be worth mentioning, were it not for the fact  that two of the minister's sons came years later to rob the same benevolent bankers -and thus began the outlaw career of the notorious James brothers, Jesse and Frank.) But of all prominent local people in Logan County's 19th-century "golden age," among the most notable were the Moreheads and Bibbs, who migrated to the area from Virginia in about 1800. 
<p>
Maj. Richard Bibb was a Revolutionary War officer turned Methodist minister,  who acquired large holdings in land and slaves in his new Kentucky home. One particular story about him has survived to the present day: Apparently feeling some conflict between the teachings of his religion and the practice of human bondage, he sent about 30 of his slaves to freedom in Liberia in 1829, and more  than 50 others were emancipated in 1849 and given 1,500 acres of local farmland, in accordance with the deceased major's will. The blacks who went to Africa were never heard from again; the ones who stayed in Kentucky took the Bibb surname along with their freedom - and in the 1850 census of Logan County virtually all  of the free blacks were named Bibb. 
<p>
Sons of Richard Bibb, meanwhile, went in different ways to make their own history, one becoming a Whig member of the United States Senate from Kentucky in the 1830's, another hybridizing a popular leafy vegetable now known as Bibb lettuce. 
<p>
The Moreheads took an even more prominent role when three brothers in the family settled in Logan County. Charles, the eldest, served in both the House and Senate of the Kentucky Legislature, and his son, Charles S. Morehead, later  held numerous state offices, including that of Governor. Presley, the youngest of the brothers, also served in both houses of the Legislature. 
<p>
Armstead, the middle brother, was the first postmaster of Russellville and also the first circuit-court clerk of Logan County.  One of his sons, James T. Morehead, was Governor of Kentucky from 1834 to 1836, and in 1841 he joined his  fellow Whig Henry Clay in the United States Senate. 
<p>
Another of Armstead's sons was Armstead S. Morehead. While his brother James  was pursuing a career in politics, A.S. Morehead (as he commonly signed his name) was living a more conventional and anonymous life, farming on the family holdings in the Green Ridge section west of Russellville. He was married twice,  possibly three times, and his wives had at least four children, one of whom was  James W. Morehead, born in 1836. There also were several blacks attached to A.S. Morehead's family - some slaves, others free - and one of them was born in 1837, Thomas Morehead (who Muhammad Ali's elderly cousin claims was James Morehead's half brother). 
<p>
In the Logan County Courthouse and in the public library in Russellville, some of the information linking Muhammad Ali to these years of Morehead history  can be found. The record is incomplete, but this is the essence of what it shows: 
<p>
A.S. Morehead died in 1865. His son James inherited large tracts of land, including part of the family farm on Duck Lick Creek. In 1870, James, then living in Robertson County, adjacent to Logan County, sold 161 acres on Duck Lick Creek to Tom and Sam Morehead ("both men of color") for $350 in cash and  four promissory notes of $650 each, to be paid annually through 1874. The land was identified in the deed as "a part of the tract on which A.S. Morehead ... lived, and on which (Tom Morehead) is now living." In 1877, when part of the debt was still outstanding, James Morehead accepted seven farm animals and 20 acres of tobacco as payment in full, and nine years later he sold Tom Morehead 80 more acres in the same vicinity. 
<p>
The records also show that Tom Morehead married Lizzie Bibb on Dec. 24, 1890, and that the couple subsequently donated land to a Baptist church in the Green Ridge neighborhood. In 1901 they deeded one acre to the county as the site for a school -probably the first school for blacks to be built there. 
<p>
Here, the public record of the lives of Muhammad Ali's greatgrandparents Tom  Morehead and Lizzie Bibb ends and it leaves many questions unanswered. There is  no indication of Tom Morehead's parentage nor of his military service. Nor is there any record to show when he died, where he was buried or who his survivors  were. For American blacks, in particular, documentary evidence is sparse, if it exists at all. It may be assumed that the black forebears of Tom Morehead and Lizzie Bibb were the property of white Moreheads and Bibbs, whose family roots can be traced far back into colonial Virginia (in the case of the Moreheads, all the way back to 1630), but no records exist to support that assumption. Customarily, the slaves of each master were listed only by age and sex, not by name.  Marriages, births and deaths of slaves were seldom recorded and even more rarely recorded was the evidence of black children fathered by white men. 
<p>
In light of the fact that the importation of slaves to Virginia from Africa ended at about the time of the Revolutionary War - some 60 years before Tom Morehead's birth - it is probable that the blacks from whom Muhammad Ali is descended, no less than the whites, had lived on American soil for generations before their migration to Kentucky. Their link with the land of their origin was no doubt lost beyond recovery long before they saw Logan County - and even there, a generation passed and disappeared without a trace before Tom Morehead was born. 
<p>
The Moreheads and Bibbs, white and black, are no longer prominent in Logan County - the names appear only a few times in the county telephone directory, and elsewhere hardly at all. But some local citizens remember the families, and  a few also know that Muhammad Ali's Morehead and Bibb ancestors were born there. 
<p>
Two Russellville sisters, John Ella Dickerson and Willie Belle Dickerson Bibb, recall that their father, Walter Dickerson, was a nephew of Tom Morehead.  "We're cousins of Odessa Grady Clay (Muhammad Ali's mother)," said Miss Dickerson, a retired schoolteacher, "and first cousins of Gillie Bell Plunkett. Cousin Gillie is right - Tom Morehead's father was a white man, a Morehead, but  we don't know what his first name was. I doubt if anybody around here knows that story. Tom Morehead has been dead nearly 70 years.  He's buried out around Green Ridge, but I don't even know where the cemetery is." 
<p>
Attorney Granville Clark's roots in Russellville and Logan County go back a long way, and his fascination with history has paralleled his interest in civil  liberties and the law. His office is in a historic old house where a delegation  of Kentuckians met in 1861 in a futile attempt to take the state out of the Union and into the Confederacy. 
<p>
"I've known for years that Muhammad is descended from Bibbs and Moreheads who once lived in this county," he said, "but I never knew just what the connection was. For some reason, I've always thought of it as having something to do with that story about old Major Bibb freeing his slaves. That's a good story, and it would make a fine novel. Just think: One of the blacks who went to Liberia might be an ancestor of some national leader in modern Africa - and one  of those who stayed here might be an ancestor of Muhammad Ali." The Highland Lick Road wound past summer-green fields of corn and tobacco and soybeans. Random inquiries at a half-dozen houses yielded no clues to the location of a country cemetery in the Green Ridge-Gordonsville area. Finally, a farmer seemed  to recall having seen the long-abandoned site. "If they was Moreheads," he said, "they was colored. They used to own a lot of this land around here, including my place." 
<p>
Another false turn, another request for directions, and finally, the farm of  J.W. Stratton - and next to it, the cemetery.  Stratton had often wondered about the graves, most of which were unmarked and all of which were carpeted with a dense mat of creeping vines. He quickly found one stone, lying almost hidden under the leaves. It belonged to Lizzie Morehead, and it showed that she was born in 1870 and died in 1919. 
<p>
"There's another stone here somewhere," Stratton said. "I've seen it many  a time." He walked slowly, his eyes fixed upon the ground. Then he stopped: "Here's the gentleman, right here." 
<p>
The stone was three feet high - or would have been, had it been standing. It  lay half-buried in the soft brown earth, its inscription facing skyward through  a coat of dried leaves. When the leaves were brushed away, the words stood out as a revelation and a puzzle: 
<p>
Thos. Morehead Co. E.  129 U.S.C.I.  At the National Archives in Washington, military service records indicate that Thomas Morehead of Logan County, Ky., served a little more than one year in the Union Army, rising from private to sergeant in that time. In later years, when his health was failing and he was unable to work, he sought the aid of a Russellville lawyer to help him obtain a  pension for his military service. 
<p>
There was some confusion about the number of Tom Morehead's military unit; he remembered it as the 122d United States Colored Infantry, but it might have been another - the 129th, perhaps. There was also some question about his exact age,  and about the nature of his disability. Then his lawyer died, and the application papers were lost, and the bureaucracy in Washington moved very slowly. 
<p>
Tom Morehead spent 25 years trying to gain the pension he was entitled to. Finally, in 1902, he was awarded a monthly payment of $8. Within a short time, he began an appeal for reconsideration and a higher award.

In 1908, when he was 71 years old and still mired in disagreement with pension officials, Tom Morehead reached back to the years of his childhood to summon help. Thus it was that twice in that year the commissioner of pensions in Washington received letters from James W. Morehead of Springfield, Robertson County, Tenn. The letters read in part: 
<p>
"I, James W. Morehead, do hereby certify that Thomas Morehead and my self is about the same age. I was born Dec. 14th 1836 and am drawing a pension on that age. I am drawing 15 dollars per month.  There is but little difference in my age and Thomas Morehead. Thomas Morehead belonged to my father A.S. Morehead and we bouth lived with him till during the last civil war and I joined the 8th Ky.  Cavelry, U.S. and Thomas Morehead a infantry Regiment U.S. I don't know the No.  of his Regiment and I did not see him any more untill after the war. I am confident there is not as much as 12 or 15 months different in our age. My Mother died when I was about 16 months old and I have often heard Thomas Morehead's Mother say that there was not much difference in our ages." 
<p>
Thomas Morehead followed each of the letters from James Morehead to the commissioner with letters of his own. "I have give you my age by one who we was boys together," he wrote, referring to James. "We worked together untill the war ... and we was bouth in the millertery severic." When no increase in his pension was forthcoming, he persisted with a patience that barely hid a tone of exasperation. On Sept. 14, 1908, he wrote once again: 
<p>
"I have give you true reports to my age. You ask me for Bibb evident but I could not give that, but I give you J.W. Morehead evidents and my mother raise us bouth and that is the best evident I can give you." 
<p>
The Government's records described Tom Morehead as a farmer and a carpenter,  5 feet 8 inches tall, with brown eyes, black hair and a "yellow" or "light brown" complexion. His physical problems were variously listed as afflictions of the liver, heart, bowels and lower back. A year before he died at the age of  75 in 1913, the pension office finally accepted his word and the word of James W. Morehead that Thomas was the age he claimed to be. Accordingly, the weary old soldier's pension was raised to the lofty level of $20 a month.  During his retirement from boxing, Muhammad Ali turned his hand to more pacific endeavors,  among them acting and diplomacy. In "Freedom Road," a televised movie adaptation of the Howard Fast novel by that name, he played the part of Gideon Jackson, a black veteran of the Union Army who struggled on against racial discrimination in the South after the war. More recently, Ali went on a brief but highly publicized diplomatic mission to Africa on behalf of the Carter Administration. During neither experience was he aware that one of his own ancestors had been a soldier for the Union, or that others, farther back, may have been among a small group of free blacks who journeyed to Africa from a small town in Kentucky. 
<p>
Now the restless fighter is preparing for one more bout. Having refused to quit as a loser after his defeat by Leon Spinks in 1978, having retired as the only three-time heavyweight champion after conquering Spinks in a rematch, it is now as if he cannot quit as a winner. 
<p>
"I'm shooting for immortality - I want to be the only four-time world champion," Ali has said repeatedly.  "Aren't you already immortal?" a reporter asked him recently.  "Yeah," Ali replied, "but not immortal enough." So he is fighting on against heavy odds - and in that show of determination and stubborness and courage perhaps there is a spark of Tom Morehead, and of the others, the Clay and Greathouse and Grady and Bibb ancestors from whom he came. 
<p>
"You can't know about yourself, or what makes you the way you are," Muhammad Ali said. "I'm a part of my ancestors, and they're a part of me. Maybe some of what I am, what I do, goes back to those people. Maybe it's them,  coming out in me."
