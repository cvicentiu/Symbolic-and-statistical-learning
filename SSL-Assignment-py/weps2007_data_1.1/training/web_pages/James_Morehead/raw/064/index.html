TURNER FAMILY (No. 239)<br>
p18, Clinton, DeWitt Co, TX, May 5, 1859. Written by James Norman Smith:<br>
I now give an account of the Norman family, as near as I have seen some of them.  Mr. Jones married a sister of my great grandmother, Keren Happuch, whose maiden name was Norman. One of those Jones lived in Washington Co, VA, who had many sons and daughters, one of whom, as I have state, married a Miss Carthell, and there are several now in IL, of the sons of this Mr. Jones.  Those Jones, i.e., the older ones, all claim to be first cousins to the Moreheads, Turner, Smith, Sandfords, etc., by the Norman side of the family.  There was also a Mr. Delaney living in E. TN in 1803 who claimed the same relationship as the Jones did, on the Norman side. My aunt Ward, as moved from NC to TN, spent 12 months with these Jones and Delaneys.  She was taken sick and stopped with these relatives.  Her brother, Benjamin, took her negroes to TN.  She was moving out with him.  She retained 1 woman and a man to wait on her while at Mr. Jones, and as my father was to move to TN, she wrote that she would stay with her relatives until he came on, which she did, and as we moved out I saw these families of Jones and Delaneys, Morehead relatives.

<blockquote><p>Letter:  To: Fred Schwend, Houston  From:  Harold August Schwend (no direct relation)<br>
10 Oct 1976  "Overland is a suburb city of St. Loius.  The St. Louis telephone directory covers a large area.  There are 3 Schwend names listed are not in my family tree records.  I have called them several times and they seem to care less about their heritage.  I called again yesterday because of the info Helen had received from you.<br>
1.  Joseph J. Schwend, 6213 Nagel St., St. Louis, MO:  He said his father's name was Albert and knew of no other relatives.<br>
2.  Norma Schwend, Hwy 30, St. Louis, Her husband's name was Walter born Oct 11, 1895, died?  His father's name was Joseph Schwend and she seemed to remember a grocery store on Connecticut St, two story, she says was brick.  She remembered there was a sister Edna (Schwend) Koutter but did not seem to remember a Fred or Annie.  She seemed very evasive and asked what I wanted the info for.  After explaining how I had traced my family tree and naturally interested in anyone with the Schwend name she seemed to care less.<br>
3.  W. E. Schwend, 3 Kings Acres, St. Louis, MO, son of Norma Schwend, talked to his wife and she referred me to his mother Norma.<br>
I have a half brother, John Emil Schwend who knew Walter Schwend, husband of aforementioned Norma.  John worked for the railroad for over 50 years and lived his adult life in the St. Louis area.  John also remembers a Joe Schwend he had never met who lived on Gresham Ave 15 or 20 years ago.  (This letter is 3 pages and shows the Schwendemann line which isn't ours as far as I can tell.  Kathie Schwend)</p>
<p>Letter, 1 Feb 1977 To Aunt Lou:  Joseph Schwend (Edna's father) married Pauline Roenhagen, their children were Edna and (Pauline - not sure of name) when Pauline and their daughter died, Joseph married Bertha Rotenhagen (Pauline's sister). Joseph & Bertha had a son Walter Schwend.  Albert was Joseph's brother but I don't know who he married.  Love, Ailene (Arlinen Foster, Edna & Joseph's granddaughter)</p>
<p>-MARRIAGE:------- Original Message --------Subject: 	Thank you!Date: 	Thu, 05 Aug 2004 15:21:49 -0400 (EDT)From: ArtGirlJennifer@aol.comTo: famseeker@mgwnet.comDear Kathie,<br>
Thank you for both the wonderful photographs of Gregor Schwend (and his<br>
wife!), and the fascinating letter from Lou Schwend Terrill to Fred Schwend.<br>
Please let me know what your costs are, as I would very much like to repay you?<br>
Lou Schwend Terrill's letter indicates a clear "tie-in" as Edna Schwend<br>
Kulter was my Grandfather's first cousin.  She was the daughter of Joseph Schwend<br>
Jr., and his first wife Katherine Rodenhagen; after Katherine's early death,<br>
Joseph Jr. married her sister Bertha, and they had a son named Walter Schwend<br>
who died in 1959.Edna Schwend married Fred Kutter, and they had two children, Kenneth Kutter<br>
and Arlene Kutter.  Edna and Fred owned a grocery store in Colorado; Edna died<br>
in 1963.Edna's parents, Joseph Schwend Jr. and his first wife Katherine Rodenhagen,<br>
were married in a triple wedding ceremony with my great grandparents, Henry<br>
Waldermeyer and Caroline Schwend (Joseph Jr.'s sister), and their brother Henry<br>
Schwend to his wife Katy, on November 26, 1884, in St. Vincent's Catholic<br>
Church, St. Louis, MO.I do not know Harold Schwend (and I am embarrassed that I do not!).  It would<br>
appear that he is a descendant of John Schwend?Thank you again for all of the information and photographs.  I still owe you the family group sheets, but my work has prevented me from taking the time to assemble them.  Hopefully, in the next several weeks I will get some time.Mark</p>

Letter from Lou Schwend Terrill, Wichita Fallas, TX-<br>
May 21, 1976 (To Fred Schwend, Houston)<br>
Dear Fred:  As far as I know your Grandfather Schwend (John) came with his father, mother and 3 brothers and maybe some sisters to America from Obershopime, GER. close to Berline, when he was 18 in time to fight in the Civil War, on the union side.<br>
The bureau of vital statistics in DC can furnish you the name of the ship and time left Germany and landed here.  You can also get his war records.  The Schwend family settled inMO, one brother, Joe had a grocery store in St. Louis and had a two story brownstone house on Connecticut St.<br>
The other brother, Ben (?) moved to Wisconsin.  He was a farmer and 3 of his sons were killed by a runaway team.  I know nothing about my mother's family except she lived in Hannibal, MO.  Her maiden name was Mary Donley Taliaferro. After her father's death she married a Douglas.  She had some 1/2 brothers and sisters.I visited with Joe's daughter, Edna Kulter in St. Louis in the 1950's. Joe also had son Fred.  Edna died in Aurora, CO.I also visited a cousin in Louisiana, MO.  Annie who was married to Lee Hostetter.  They had one son, Raymond, whose wife was Louise.<br>
Louise and I corresponded once a year, until this year my letter has not been answered.  I am afraid they may be dead, as they were both in ill health.  They have 1 son, Clyde.When I was there I saw my father's farm.  It was beautiful.I hope this will help a little bit.Love, Aunt Lou (sister to James Monroe Schwend)<p>DEATH:  Is this him?St. Louis City Death Records, 1850-1908 St. Louis City Death Records, 1850-1908<br>

<p>FATHER's WILL:<br>
Letter from Hildegarde Evoy, 6161 Willow Lake Dr., Hudson, OH 44235, 16 June 2005:<br>
I wrote to Maury Co, TN for the will/inventories of both James Turner, son of Kerenhappuck Norman and James Turner and also William Turner.</p>
<p>Will - Maury Co, TN:  William Turner, Sr. Estate record, dated 13 Jan 1814, last record was 1832 due to guardianship.<br>
William Turner, Sr. Deceased/husband; Guardian Col. James T. Sandford; Son-Ward James L. Turner, Wade Hampton Turner; Daughter/Ward Elizabeth Turner; Son/Ward/dis Willaim Turner; Dau/ward/dis Winifred Turner; Son/ward/dis John B. Turner; Dau/ward/dis Mrs. Nancy Turner Miller; Son/ward/dis Anthony J. Turner; Com James Black; Com John Miller; Wid./Buy Mrs. Nancy Turner S./ Wid/Board/Payee/Buy Mrs. Nancy Turner Wade; Guardian 1831- Thornton Chandler; Admin William Yancey<br>
(Note from Hildegarde Evoy)  William had a large estate, I believe that the payee means money owed to the estate; and buy might have been people who bought what was for sale.  I just don't know that much about estates. It gives the amount of money paid to both the widow (Nancy LeGrand) and for the children so they could live.  Apparently there was also some making of whiskey that was done on the estate.  It surpirsed me that all the children were considered a ward, but only seeing the abstract I have to trust the woman who did the work.  By the way, Barbara Garrett is the archivist at the Maury County Archives and she is descended from James T. Sandford.  He is the nephew of James Turner, who married first Miss Wyatt and then Sarah Irby.  James T. Sandford was the son of Robert Sandford and Kerrenhappuck Turner, daughter of James Turner and Kerrenhappuck Norman.  It really gets complicated.</p>

<p>LETTER:  email from W. B. Atkins, JR (wbatkins@flash.net), 23 May 2002:  Hi Kathie, my wife's ggrandfather was Calvin Washington Turner, a son of Dr. James LeGrand Turner who was thought to be the first doctor in Bastrop Co, TX.  Dr. Turner was b 9 Sep 1799 in Richmond Co, NC to William Turner and his wife the former Nancy LeGrand (a Huguenot). (As far as I can tell, he was the only child)  He m. 1st a Miss Kitchen and 2nd to Julina Sessums, b 1808 in Raleigh, Wake Co, NC.  I know nothing of her ancestors.  He married Julina on 25 Dec 1824 in Lawrence Co., TN.  They were in the 1830 census in Lauderdale Co., AL.  I have never known for sure where they were from then until they got to Bastrop Co., TX and my guess is that was 1847/48, not 1845 as shown on your husband's ancestors' records. (And that exact date is a big deal to my wife because if your linear ancestor was in TX by statehood in 1846 you can get in the D.R.T) Dr. Turner died in Alum Creek, Bastrop Co., TX on 9 Dec 1870, and his wife died there 3 Oct 1876.  Both are buried in the Alum Creek Cemetery.<br>
From the family bible of Permelia Turner, Wife of Calvin Washington Turner, she shows that Dr. James Turner and his wife Julina had 15 children:<br>
1.  William Alexander Turner, b 3 Oct 1825 AL, d-Bastrop Co., TX 16 Dec 1857, M-Melinda Marchbank in Montor Co., MS<br>
2.  Della Elizabeth Turner, b 22 Oct 1826 in TN.  She married Horace Alsup<br>
3.  James Sanford Turner, b 2 Sep 1828 in TN and died in the Civil War 20 May 1864 in Yellow Bayou, LA.  He left a widow, the former Emily Ann Alsup<br>
4.  Harriet LeGrand Turner b 7 Apr 1830 in TN.  Married J. Alsup<br>
5.  Richard Anthony Turner, b 16 Feb 1832 in AL<br>
6.  Wade Hampton Turner, b 28 Mar 1833 in TN<br>
7.  Calvin Washington Turner, b 13 Mar 1835 in TN, d 13 June 1901 in Bastrop,Bastrop Co, TX.  He m 1st-Martha E. Litton, both she and 1st baby died in childbirth 13 Mar 1868; m 2nd Catherine Tisdale, widow of Benjamin Milam Hamilton on 22 Nov 1871.  Catherine had one child from her 1st marriage and she and Calvin had 9 more.  HE served in the CSA<br>
8.  Marion Dinah Turner, b 2 Dec 1837 AL<br>
9.  Wallace Edwin Turner, b 25 Nov 1838 AL, d 17 Jul 1843<br>
10.  Henry Harrison Turner, b 24 Aug 1840 in TN, d 12 Jun 1921 in Marshall, Harrison Co, TX. Married 14 Feb in LaGrange, Fayette Co, TX to Elizabeth Ann Harkins.<br>
11. Julina Catherine Turner, b 7 Jun 1842, d 17 Dec 1903, San Saba, San Saba Co, TX, M-7 Mar 1857 Hugh Llewellyn Harkins<br>
12.  John Brown Turner, b 25 May 1844 in Montgomery, Montgomery Co, AL, d 1926 in Kerrville, Kerr Co.,TX.  Married 7 Dec 1869 Jeanette Meeks in Bastrop Co., TX (I imagine your husband and you have a great deal more than this on this couple!)<br>
13.  Wallace Edwin Turner, b 1 Jul 1846, d 19 Feb 1926 in San Saba, San Saba Co., TX, M 23 Sep 1869 in Bastrop Co to Lucy Wright<br>

15.  Anna Elizabeth Turner, b 16 Oct 1851 Bastrop Co., TX, d 16 Jan 1932 in Lampasas, Lampasas Co., TX, M-1st Ezelial Wilson; m 2nd Col Bearden<br>
NOTE:  I have quite a bit on the descendants of Calvin Washington Turner and a couple of others but I doubt if you are interested in that sort of "Lateral" genealogy.  I can take you back from Dr. LeGrand's father, William to his father,. James Turner, Jr to his Father, James Turner, SR.  Incidentally, James Sr's wife was the famous Kerenhappuch Norman Turner who was a heroine of the Revolutionary War battle of Guilford courthouse , NC and who was the first such heroine to be recognized with a statue and, I think, her own website!<br>
Let me know how much more you want.  Bill Atkins in Fort Worth</p>

And you also asked about the LeGrand line and I'll tell you right off that most of what I learned came from a book on Pierre LeGrand written by Louis Everett LeGrand of Richmond. I'd bet you anything this book is in most genealogy sections of libraries in Virginia. The book is "Pierre LeGrand in Virginia, 1700" Baltimore, Gateway Press 1995. The book is almost pure genealogy stuff, but from correspondence with some almost fanatic LeGrand genealogists, I have formed a picture of a young Protestant couple, engaged to be married, living in Normandy and bedeviled by the Catholics to the point that in about 1681 they literally had to flee for their lives. The bride-to-be, Judith Vril, escaped with her family into Holland and Pierre sneaked onto a small cross-channel sailing vessel which left Bohain, France for England. At some point, the couple joined-up in London where the records show they were married on 10 Jul 1682 in St. James Dukes Palace. Later, they were to live a few years in The Hague, Holland and that is where their five children were born. Most of the Huguenots were fairly well-to-do people, they were energetic and skilled craftsmen, artisans and merchants and there were so many of them in England in the late 1600s that they were creating so much competition for the English that they became quite a problem to the crown. So the government started putting pressure on them to leave--indeed thousands of them migrated to such places as South Africa and the American Colonies. But there was a certain group of Huguenots for whom the King had a very special affection, and to this group he set aside 20,000 acres of prime land along the James River a few miles west of Richmond. To free the land, he first had to evict an Indian Tribe, the Manakins. And in 1699 the first of three shiploads of Huguenots arrived in Jamestown to settle the land around what was now known as Manakintowne. Pierre LeGrand, though living in Holland, heard about this opportunity, took his family to London to board the "Peter and Anthony" and they arrived in Manakintowne on 1 Oct 1700. Pierre LeGrand didn't live long in the new world; he died probably 1707-10. His wife Judith died in 1719. Our line descends from one of their sons, Jean Pierre LeGrand b. 1697 in The Hague, Holland. He married Jane Magdalen Micheaux in 1720/24 in Goochland Co., VA. They had nine children; the fourth was James LeGrand who was born in 1737 in Goochland Co., VA. James married Elizabeth "Betsy" Wade in 1763 in Halifax Co., VA and from that union came nine children, the third being Mary "Nancy" LeGrand in about 1775. She married William Turner in Halifax Co., VA 4 Oct 1798 in Halifax Co., VA. From this marriage came James LeGrand Turner and I now know that he had four siblings: Wade Hampton, William Jr., Elizabeth and Mary. In 1807 William Turner's father, James Turner Jr. (now living in Richmond Co., NC) received for services in the Revolutionary War, 1,000 acres of land lying along the Duck River in Maury Co., TN. and I had originally thought that the whole family, James Jr., William, all their families, in short, ALL the Turners moved to Tennessee. That was wrong. There was a James Turner III who didn't want to move, so he stayed on his father's place, and his descendants still occupy this farm! The current resident is a Hap Turner--he has an email address but he won't reply to my messages--but he was found by a person doing DNA research for the FamilyTreeDNA organization. Hap told her that Kerenhappuch was buried on his place and he knew exactly where her grave was.<br>
The FamilyTreeDNA organization contacted me to help them find a living male descendant of Calvin Washington Turner. There are none! So I helped them find a descendant of Wallace Edwin Turner (his gg-grandson) and his lives right here in Fort Worth.<br>
The other thing you might find interesting; five sons of Dr. James LeGrand Turner served in the 12th Texas Cavalry, CSA. James Sanford Turner (died in battle at Yellow Bayou, LA). Calvin Washington Turner, Henry Harrison Turner, Wallace Edwin Turner and James Brown Turner. From his CSA Pension Record I learned that James Brown had to wait 'til 1863 to join because of his age, and his "messmates" nicknamed him "Hogeye". Let me know if you need anything else.

Subject: living male Turner quest ,Kathie and Robbie, I think these are brothers of John Brown Turner named Calvin Washington Turner with his second wife Catherine Tisdale Turner and Wallace Irwin Turner with his wife Lucy who lived very near each other in Bastrop co. TX. where their parents James LeGrande Turner and Juliana died a few years earlier. Do you know anything about any of these or their descendants? I see sons here so there is hope:) Nancy<br>

<p>rootsweb.com Maury County, TennesseeFounding of Columbia, the County Seat<br>
In 1798, Col. Nicholas Long (Revolutionary War) of Halifax County, NC, willed to his sons Nicholas and Lunsford equal shares in 5,000 acres of land on the "Western Waters." (The 5,000- acre tract adjoined on the west 25,000 acres granted to General Nathaniel Greene for his distinguished service in the war).<br>
Nicholas, who settled in Sumner County, TN, owed Anthony Bledsoe for surveying when Bledsoe was killed by an Indian in 1788. To settle the debt, on July 26, 1807, the heirs of Nicholas Long conveyed to the heirs of Anthony Bledsoe their interest in the land. On March 7, 1808, the heirs of Bledsoe, or their successors, conveyed 843 acres to John White. White, on May 30, 1808, deeded 150 acres of this land for $500 to the Commissioners of Columbia for the laying out of the town.<br>
By the same Act of the General Assembly that had established Maury County, Joshua Williams, William Frierson, Isaac Roberts, John Lindsey, and Joseph Brown were designated to select a county seat near the center of the county. This seat was to be known as Columbia.<br>
Two or three other locations were considered, especially a site on the lands of General Isaac Roberts on Bear Creek, a few miles northeast of the present location. The boundaries of Columbia were set out as follows: "From Burns' spring by Ninth St. to Frierson; thence north to White's spring; east to Duck River, up the river to a point north of Burns' spring; thence south to the place of beginning." The metes and bounds of the 150 acres upon which Columbia was built can be found in the deed, as recorded in Book A, Volume 1, pg. 42 in the office of the Register at Maury County Courthouse.<br>
The location of Columbia was, in 1808, forested in woods and overgrown with thickets, which had to be cleared. Two large ponds in the areas of present West 7th and Garden Streets had to drained and much cane removed.<br>
The one-room log law office of James K. Polk and the home of Congressman Houston Thomas were built on a lot near the corner of Garden and West 7th. Jeremiah Cherry operated a large inn in Columbia as early as 1810. Also by 1810, Mrs. McCain operated the first store owned by a woman in Maury County. Social gatherings and tea parties were held there. A little later, Peter Cheatham built an inn, and others followed. The first store, built of logs, was probably constructed by John Hedge on the south side of the square. Peter Cohea's store attracted the trade of Indians, who came to exchange furs and other items for chinaware, trinkets and whiskey.<br>
By an Act of the Legislature on November 17, 1817, the expanding "village" of Columbia was incorporated. By 1837, Columbia had a population of 1,500 and was considered by historians of that time as one of the most flourishing towns in Tennessee.<br>

<p>BIO-JAMES LEGRAND TURNER:<br>
1799  James Legrand Turner was born to William and Nancy (LEGRAND) Turner in Richmond Co, NC or VA (different census shows different states).<br>
1803 The United States of America was twenty-seven years old, and growing in leaps and bounds. On March 1st, Ohio became the 17th state, joining Delaware (1787), Pennsylvania (1787), New Jersey (1787), Georgia (1788), Connecticut (1788), Massachusetts (1788), Maryland (1788), South Carolina (1788), New Hampshire (1788), Virginia (1788), New York (1788), North Carolina (1789), Rhode Island (1790), Vermont (1791), Kentucky (1792), and Tennessee (1796). President Thomas Jefferson added the Louisiana Purchase and wanted it explored.  The expedition was led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to chart the new territory. By the end of 1803, the expedition was on its way and had reached Camp River Dubois, Illinois.  When the journey ended, they had covered over 8,000 miles in less than two and a half years and the expedition greatly enhanced understanding of the land beyond the Mississippi River.<br>
1807 James' grandfather, James Jr., who was living in Richmond Co, NC  received 1,000 acres of land lying along the Duck River in Maury Co, TN for services in the Revolutionary War.  All of James Jr.'s family moved to TN except for his son, James Turner III.  James Legrand Turner would have had an adventure traveling from NC to TN at the age of 8.<br>
Bet 1807-1814 The Turner family would start a plantation that would farm with the help of slaves in Maury Co, TN.  They had 13 slaves who helped do the field work of raising cotton, corn, flax, hay and rye.  The slaves were probably also employed with the house work and had skills such as spinning and cloth making and blacksmithing. The cotton and flax were spun into cloth as was the wool from the sheep they raised.  The family owned quite a few spinning wheels and a loom and various pails for washing and cleaning.  Other animals on the farm included hogs, horses, cattle and geese.  There was also some whiskey making with 2 stills the family kept on the property along with assorted barrels for storage of corn and whiskey.  Many farm tools and equipment for the raising of crops were also owned by the family.  Their household included various butter churns, pewter ware, knives and forks, earthenware and various kettles and pots for cooking.  The furniture was sufficient for the large family which consisted of 5 beds and steads, chests, trunks, a bureau, table and chairs.  For enjoyment the family had books to read and playing cards for games and even a mirror.  Apparently both his parents, Nancy and William Turner, enjoyed riding horses as they both had saddles, a man's and a lady's side saddle.  Son, James Legrand, would have time to study and probably acquired his interest at this time to becoming a doctor.  Unfortunately, his father didn't live too long after they moved to TN.<br>
bet Sept 1809-13 Dec 1814 Father, William Sr., dies in Maury Co, TN.<br>
13 Jan 1814 James L. was mentioned as a son (and a Ward since he was only 15) in his father's will (William Turner Sr.) in Maury Co, TN.  Much of the inventory of the plantation was sold probably to repay debts.  Mother, Nancy, was able to keep much of the household items that she deemed necessary and also had most of the livestock and some slaves to continue the farm's upkeep. James L.'s Uncle Sandford (who was married to his father's sister) was appointed as the Guardian of the minor children.  He procured more of the estate's property and must have been a tremendous help to the family and Nancy Turner who was left a widow with 8 minor aged children.<br>
Bet 1814-1824 James L. attended school and then probably college to become a doctor.<br>
1820 In the U.S.,  James Monroe was president. He would be re-elected later that year, winning 231 electoral votes, to James Quincy Adams one electoral vote. The country was growing; the previous year, Missouri Territory had sought to become a state. With eleven free states and eleven slave states, the prospect drew heated debate. The Missouri Compromise was reached and as part of the agreement, Maine, previously part of Massachusetts would become the 23rd state on 15 March 1820, and Missouri would be admitted as a slave state (21 August 1821), thereby maintaining the balance. In addition a line was drawn through the Louisiana Territory which would make future states north of the line in that territory free states, and future states in the territory south of the line, slave states. As evidenced by the need for a balance of free and slave states, abolition was already a hot-button issue. In New York, eighty-six free black emigrants set sail from New York City on the ship Elizabeth to Freetown in the British colony of Sierra Leone. The British had abolished the slave trade in 1807.  It was the romantic period of Byron, Shelley, and Jane Austen. <br>
25 Dec 1824 In Lawrence Co, TN, James, age 25, was married to Julina Sessums, age 16, who was born in NC.  He was a doctor.  Where did he go to school for that occupation?<br>
3 Oct 1825 In Alabama, son, William Alexander, was born.<br>
22 Oct 1826 Daughter, Della Elizabeth, was born in TN.  James's father, William, had probably inherited some of the 1,000 acres that his father received for military duty (during the American Revolution) in Maury Co, TN on the Duck River.  Is this where Dr. James lived?<br>
17 Dec 1827 James sold 81 acres for $162.00 on Rutherford's Creek  that he owned in Maury Co, TN to David Underwood.  It bordered Wm. Allen, James Huey and Joseph Rhodes land.<br>
2 Sep 1828 Son, James Sanford Turner, was born in TN.<br>
7 Apr 1830 Daughter, Harriet LeGrand, was born in TN.<br>
1830 James and his wife were in the census for this year in Lauderdale Co, AL.<br>
28 Mar 1833 Son, Wade Hampton, was born in TN.<br>
13 Mar 1835 Son, Calvin Washington, was born in TN.<br>
2 Dec 1837 Daughter, Marion Dinah, born in Alabama.<br>
25 Nov 1838 Son, Wallace Edwin Turner, born in AL.<br>
24 Aug 1840 Son, Henry Harrison Turner, born in TN.<br>
7 Jun 1842 Daughter, Julina Catherine, born in TN or AL.<br>
17 Jul 1843 Son, Wallace Edwin, dies in probably Montgomery, Montgomery Co, AL at age 4.<br>
25 May 1844 Son, John Brown Turner, born Montgomery, Montgomery Co, AL.<br>
1 Jul 1846 Son, Wallace Edwin Turner, born in AL or TX.<br>
abt 1846-1850 Family moves to Bastrop Co, TX.  James Turner was thought to be the first doctor in Bastrop County.<br>
1850 The U.S. Federal Census counted 23,191,876 residents. Of this number, 2,244,602 were enumerated as being of foreign birth. Not surprisingly, due to the Irish Potato famine of the 1840s, 961,719 people claimed Irish origins-or 42%, making it the largest single country of origin cited. These numbers did not go unnoticed in urban areas and resentment of the Irish Catholic immigrants gave birth to a period of nativism. Irish immigrants found themselves discriminated against during this period as cartoons portrayed them with simian features, and newspaper help wanted ads sometimes specified that “Irish need not apply.”<br>
The growth of California because of the gold rush led to statehood in September of 1850. The state’s admission was part of “The Compromise of 1850,” presented by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The compromise was an effort to keep the U.S. united as southern states threatened to secede. At issue was whether the new state of California, Washington, D.C., and the new territory acquired in the war with Mexico would allow slavery, and over a land dispute with Texas.<br>
The compromise also covered the Fugitive Slave Act, which legally required the return of fugitive slaves who had fled to the north from slave states.  The law also held citizens who refused to cooperate with the apprehension of fugitive slaves subject to legal action. It pushed the fugitives who had begun new lives in the north, even further north - to Canada. Rather than stem the tide of fugitives though, the activities of the Underground Railroad increased following 1850 and it increased northern determination to end slavery.<br>
Women‘s rights activists gathered in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850 for the first Women’s Rights Convention.  Newspaper coverage of the convention varied based on the point of view of the papers and their editors and some of the articles can be found online at the website of Assumption College in Worcester.<br>
10 June 1850 Son, George Washington, born in Bastrop Co, TX.<br>
2 Aug 1850 Another of James' child dies when son, George Washington, aged 2 months dies in Bastrop Co, TX.<br>
5 Sept 1850 James Turner, 61, is a Doctor in Bastrop Co, TX with wife, Julina, 42.  Their 7 children living with them were Wade H, age 18, farmhand; Calvin, 14; Mary, 12; Henry, 9; Julina, 8; John, 6; Wallace, 4.  James Turner only had about $100 of Real Estate.<br>
16 Oct 1851 The last of 15 children that James and Julina had, daughter, Anna Elizabeth, was born in Bastrop County, TX.<br>
1853 In the U.S., Franklin Pierce took the oath of office, succeeding Millard Fillmore. Railroads were connecting the country and making it easier to move westward. Southerners hoped for a transcontinental railroad that would take a southern route and at the end of 1853, the Gadsden Purchase was signed defining the U.S./Mexican border west of El Paso, Texas. While the transcontinental railroad took a more northerly route, the purchase for the sum of $10 million dollars did add more than 29,000 square miles in what is now southern New Mexico and Arizona.<br>
In Cincinnati, Ohio, progress was being made in the field of firefighting. Prior to April of 1853, firefighting crews mainly consisted of volunteers. As they began receiving payments from insurance companies and private parties, competition heightened. That changed on 1 April, when the Cincinnati Fire Department became the first full-time professional fire department in the country. )<br>
In New Orleans, Louisiana, that year "Yellow Jack," or yellow fever, wreaked havoc killing more than 7,800 people.In other parts of the world, tension over holy sites in Palestine erupted into the Crimean War. By the end of 1853, France, Britain, and Turkey had formed an alliance that pitted them against the Russians in a war that would last until the Treaty of Paris in 1856. Around the world in China, a bloody civil war was raging. At the heart of the rebellion was Hung Hsiu-ch'uan, a Cantonese student who had visions in which he believed he was visited by God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ. He began a movement that turned into a full- blown rebellion when the government began targeting them. By that time, the movement had a large army and had built up a treasury. The Taiping Rebellion is largely considered to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in history with casualties estimated at around 20 million. 1853 also marks the birth of the potato chip. They were the brainchild of George Crum, an American Indian working at a resort in Saratoga Springs, New York, after a guest rejected his french fries for being too thick. French fries had been introduced to America by Thomas Jefferson, who served them to rave reviews at Monticello. <br>
16 Dec 1857 Son, William Alexander, dies in Bastrop County, Tx.  He was married to Melinda Marchbank.<br>
Aug 1860 Before the Civil War, life was good for the Turner family.  James was still a doctor, still showing age as 61 and his wife was 54.  They had real estate worth $8,000 and personal estate of $8,595 which was a lot in those days. Sons, Calvin W, age 15 was farming and had $1,000 of personal property; John B., 14; Wallis E., age 12 and new daughter, Ann E was 8.  Was this Dollie?<br>
20 May 1864 Son, James Sanford Turner, dies in the Civil War in Yellow Bayou, LA.  He left a widow, the former Emily Ann Alsup.  Five sons of Dr. James Turner served in the 12th Texas Cavalry for the Confederacy.  They included James Sanford, Calvin Washington, Henry Harrison, Wallace Edwin and James Brown Turner.<br>
9 Dec 1870 Dr. James Legrand Turner dies in Alum Creek, Bastrop Co, TX at the age of 71.  His wife was still living at the time.  He was buried in the Alum Creek Cemetery.</p>
