  Claire Louise Caudill graduated from medical school in 1946, she could have 
  begun her career in many places with better medical facilities than her native 
  Morehead.</font></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But 
  Caudill belonged at home. "Just look at the hills," she said recently.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Morehead 
  is surrounded by the beauty of the Appalachian foothills. On a snowy day, the 
  mountainous ridges appear to be nothing more than a distant, luminous dream.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>They 
  are more than dreams in the life of Morehead, however. In nearly every respect, 
  they are the reality of what Morehead is, and what this bustling Rowan County 
  seat hopes to be.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The 
  hills dictate the ebb and flow of life in Morehead. The rough terrain determines 
  what businesses locate here, and more often than not, what businesses choose 
  not to come.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But 
  people like Caudill, now 79 and still practicing medicine, have chosen to stay 
  here, and in the process have made Morehead special. Many people point to two 
  institutions -- the St. Claire Medical Center and Morehead State University 
  -- as pivotal to the emergence of Morehead as a regional hub for education, 
  health and retail business. And Caudill, in a way, personifies the relationship 
  between the two institutions. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It 
  was Caudill's efforts in the early 1960s that resulted in the building of the 
  medical center named for her. St. Claire is now a regional medical center, with 
  about 800 employees and a number of medical specialists who offer the region's 
  residents medical attention close to home, so they don't have to drive to Huntington, 
  Ashland or Lexington.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>And 
  it was a fierce Rowan County feud between distant relatives of Caudill's, the 
  Tolliver family, and another family, the Martins, that in no small way resulted 
  in the founding of the teachers' college that has become Morehead State University. 
  The feud &#8211; dubbed the "Rowan County War" -- received national attention 
  and prompted many residents to leave the area.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Today, 
  Morehead residents are proud of their town and eager to talk about the changes 
  that have occurred here. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"We 
  are probably the most progressive town in Eastern Kentucky in the way of growth 
  and what we have going for on for us," said Morehead Mayor Larry Breeze.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It 
  was that progress that prompted Cornell University professor James McConkey 
  to write a book about Morehead and Rowan County. "Rowan's Progress," published 
  by Pantheon Books, traces the community's evolution from violence to vibrance.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"I 
  came back after many years," said McConkey, who taught English at Morehead State 
  in the 1950s. "I was just really astounded by what had happened there."</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Much 
  of the change was prompted by construction in the 1960s of Interstate 64, which 
  crosses the county just north of Morehead. The interstate has made the city's 
  outskirts a natural place for fast-food restaurants and shopping centers.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But 
  Main Street suffers chronic congestion, too. Cars never go more than few miles 
  an hour, and they are bumper-to-bumper during rush hour. Stopping somewhere 
  to shop can be an excercise in creativity.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"Right 
  now if you were driving through Morehead and wanted to stop at one of the local 
  businesses, you're afraid to get out of traffic, afraid you can't get back in," 
  said car dealer Larry Fannin, president of the Morehead- Rowan County Chamber 
  of Commerce.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Much 
  of that congestion should be eased by the building of a three-lane, 1.6-mile 
  bypass. Part of the traffic, however, is undoubtedly due to the university -- 
  the town's "No. 1 industry," said C. Roger Lewis, who owns one of the community's 
  largest real-estate agencies.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"It's 
  the main blood. . . . That's the reason that this town's not up and down as 
  much as some of the other places around,"he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Morehead 
  State has developed into a vibrant educational institution, known for much more 
  than as the place where New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms played football. 
  Enrollment dropped during much of the 1980s, when the school was immersed in 
  a controversy that prompted two presidents to depart. But in the last six years 
  under President C. Nelson Grote, enrollment grew to nearly 9,000 students.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The 
  school employs nearly 1,000 faculty and staff, making it the county's largest 
  employer. The students also have an economic impact, and in turn draw other 
  people -- parents and friends -- to town.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"They 
  come here and go shopping," Grote said. They go out to Wal-Mart and they go 
  to the Holiday Inn or to Shoney's or to Ponderosa . . . and have a meal and 
  they like that. They're treated well and they come back."</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The 
  establishment of the St. Claire Medical Center in 1963 gave Morehead another 
  vital institution lacked by other communities in the region.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>After 
  returning to Morehead in the late 1940s, Caudill built a clinic to serve the 
  area, but it was obvious that more was needed. Caudill convinced community leaders 
  and the Sisters of Notre Dame to build a hospital. Today St. Claire is a sprawling 
  medical clinic with 159 beds, and there are plans for a $20 million expansion.</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Morehead 
  is somewhat protected from recessions by the stable employment offered by the 
  university and medical center, other state offices and the lack of large industry, 
  community leaders say. Yet many say that other businesses need to be encouraged, 
  in particular, wood products.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Morehead 
  is the biggest producer and exporter of veneer wood in the state, and the fourth 
  largest in the nation, said Tom Calvert, executive director of the Morehead-Rowan 
  County Economic Development Council.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"If 
  nothing else, you've go to look at that and say 'Wow, that's big time,' " Calvert 
  said. But more must be done to encourage the local production of finished wood 
  products such as furniture, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Late 
  last year, area leaders formed the council to try to attract more industry. 
  Morehead leaders also hope the region can capitalize on nearby Cave Run Lake, 
  the state's fifth largest, to promote tourism. Tentative plans exist for a large 
  lodge and golf course.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Calvert 
  noted that Cincinnati "has the fifth highest boater registration in the nation, 
  and they don't have a lake to put it on." People from Ohio, he said, are down 
  at the lake every weekend. The key is to make the lake a vacation spot, rather 
  than just a place to spend the weekend.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>For 
  most people in Morehead, the city is the only place they would ever want to 
  be. You can drive through town and note the number of businesses that have been 
  handed down from father to son, some for more than two generations.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Alpha 
  Hutchinson, chairman and chief operating officer of Morehead's Citizens Bank, 
  has traveled extensively throughout the nation and Europe, but he says he wouldn't 
  live anywhere else. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"I 
  like to travel abroad -- Europe, Africa, Hawaii, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, 
  all over Europe," Hutchinson said. But when "I get back to the hills, I'm anxious 
  to get my cornbread, my soup beans. . . . I get back down to normal."</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In 
  all likelihood, it is the dream-like but unyielding hills that have fostered 
  the resiliency and devotion in Morehead's residents. It has made them endure, 
  and in many instances, prosper.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It 
  was a dream that brought McConkey, the Cornell professor, back to Morehead. 
  A few years ago, he said, he dreamed about the time his young son cut his lip 
  badly while playing with the family puppy. Caudill prepared to stitch the cut, 
  but she was exhausted after returning from the hills, where she had been caring 
  for patients and going days without sleep.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Caudill 
  asked McConkey's wife to hold her hand so it wouldn't shake. <span>&#160;</span>Recalling 
  that episode, McConkey said, made him realize after the dream how much Caudill 
  had given of herself to the people and the region.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"It 
  just struck me (that) we spend so much of our time bewailing the limitations 
  of what people can do and wondering if there is such a thing as good in the 
  world," he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><span style="font-family: 'ChelthmITC Bk BT Book', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Around 
  Morehead, Caudill is known as the "baby doctor," or simply "Dr. Louise." She 
  is something of a household name, having delivered an estimated 8,000 babies 
  in her more than 40 years in the area.</span></font></p>

  Caudill's modesty during an interview does little to drive home the point, few 
  residents have played such an integral role in the community's development.</span></font></p>

  Morehead was the center of the "Rowan County War." On Election Day in 1884,

  families moved out of the community. Twice the state militia was called in,
