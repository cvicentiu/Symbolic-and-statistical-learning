<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus"><i><b>Union Carbide Company</b> has it
roots in <b>Spray, NC<img src="carbidecans[1].jpg" width="266" height="205" align=right></b></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Papyrus">On the second day of May 1892, a Canadian by the name of
<b>
Thomas Willson</b>, who will forever be known as Thomas &quot;Carbide&quot; Willson,
discovered quite by accident an inexpensive method for manufacturing Acetylene
Gas. Wilson along with an American associate J<b>ames Turner Moorhead</b> had formed
the &quot;Willson Aluminum Company&quot; in <b> Spray North Carolina</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Papyrus">After several unsuccessful attempts to make aluminum in
an electric furnace designed by Willson for that purpose, it was suggested that
company attempt to produce metallic calcium which in turn would be used in the
production of Aluminum. What Willson did not know was that it was even more
difficult to produce metallic calcium than it was to produce Aluminum, so in
ignorance Willson poured coal tar and lime into the furnace expecting to produce
metallic calcium.</font>
<p><font face="Papyrus">The end result of this experiment was a dark brittle
mass that gave off gas when immersed in water. Willson and his employees were
convinced they had successfully produced metallic calcium, they were wrong, they
had in fact produced calcium carbide which when immersed in water produces
acetylene gas. The Frenchman H. Lechatelier discovered the combustion of Oxygen
and acetylene in 1895.</font></p>

<p><font face="Papyrus">Union Carbide Company grew from work begun in 1891 by
Major James Morehead and Canadian inventor Thomas Willson. Their determined but
unsuccessful attempts to produce aluminum in an electric furnace led instead to
two discoveries -- a way to make calcium carbide and a method to produce
acetylene gas from that carbide. Calcium carbide -- known by the chemical
formula CaC2 -- is a compound composed of the elements calcium and carbon. The
brittle gray calcium carbide, formed from mixing coal tar and lime, released
acetylene gas when placed in water. Confident that acetylene would achieve wide
use in city lighting and heating, eight companies purchased the rights to
manufacture calcium carbide from Morehead and Willson between 1892 and 1897.
Seven of them failed, largely due to inadequate machinery and the inability to
economically generate the huge amounts of electric power needed for production.</font>
<p><font face="Papyrus">The plant built in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, by a
group of businessmen from the Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company of Chicago
succeeded due to its invention of a furnace that could produce calcium carbide
round the clock at reasonable cost. Satisfied with the promise they saw in their
enterprise, the group formed the Union Carbide Company in 1898.</font>
<p><font face="Papyrus">A second Union Carbide Company plant was established a
short time later at Niagara Falls, New York. In 1914, the group purchased the
Canadian patents for calcium carbide and formed the Union Carbide Company of
Canada Limited to operate a third plant in Ontario.</font></p>
