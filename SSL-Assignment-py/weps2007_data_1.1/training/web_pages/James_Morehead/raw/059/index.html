Highlight a part of a web page and use the &quot;selection&quot; option in print

<p>This page is organized according to family groups and will contain several thousand
names when completed.&nbsp; If you are looking for a
specific name, the fastest way to locate it is to use the &quot;find&quot;
feature incorporated into most browsers.&nbsp; To use this feature, hold down
the control (Ctrl) key and the letter &quot;F&quot; key on your keyboard at the
same time.&nbsp; A window will appear on your screen.&nbsp; It will have a space
to type in a name and options which you can choose.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Find
Next&quot; to start your search.&nbsp; You can search for one word by itself or
for a series of words grouped together.&nbsp; The word(s) do not have to be
names of people.</p>
<p>It is my intent not to list the names of living people unless they request
that I do so.&nbsp; If you are a descendant of someone buried in Old Chalybeate
Cemetery and&nbsp; you want your name included on this page, email me with your
request.</p>
<p>I have various types of dates and locations for different people listed
below.&nbsp; However, due to the massive nature of this project for two
different cemeteries (Old Chalybeate Springs and Old Bethel) about ten or twenty
miles apart in the original Union County, Kentucky, I am not listing that
information on this web page at this time.&nbsp; If you would like specific
information for specific people listed below, email me.</p>

either Elijah Shelton or his wife Elizabeth.&nbsp; However, two of their children
have stones in the Chalybeate Cemetery.&nbsp; There is also a record of four
stones for the Lynn family.&nbsp; According to the notes that my father, Robert
Henry Sigler left me on a 7.5 minute USGS quadrangle map of the Chalybeate area,
the home of &quot;Oldest Elijah Shelton&quot; was located about 3000 feet from
the Chalybeate Cemetery.&nbsp; A new modern house now exists at or near the
location of the home of the oldest Elijah Shelton.&nbsp; I have checked the four
Webster County cemetery books published by the Webster County Historical Society
and have found no entry for this Elijah Shelton.&nbsp; I am therefore going to
list the descendants of Elijah Shelton and Elizabeth Lynn on this page as
descendants of Chalybeate until someone proves that they are not buried in the
