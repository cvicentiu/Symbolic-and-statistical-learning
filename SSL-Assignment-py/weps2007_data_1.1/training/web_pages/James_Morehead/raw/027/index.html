Although neither was a native of Northern Kentucky, both lived many years in Covington and were known for the fiery oratory, both in the courts as attorneys and in local and statewide politics.<p>  Two names not as well known, but also with Northern Kentucky connections, were James Turner Morehead and Charles Slaughter Morehead. Both served as governor in the early 1800s. While both have the same last name, records could not be found to say if they were related.<p>  James T. Morehead, namesake of the Rowan County city for which Morehead State University is named, was the first native-born Kentuckian elected governor. He practiced law for many years in Covington and died here.<p>  Charles S. Morehead was governor in the years just before the Civil War, went into exile from the state for several years and later was a frequent visitor to Northern Kentucky, where one of his daughters lived.<p>  The following is a closer look at the lives of James T. Morehead and Charles S. Morehead:<p>  -<p>  James T. Morehead<p>  He was born near Shepherdsville on May 24, 1797, the son of Armistead and Lucy Latham Morehead. When he was 3 the family moved to Russellville in Logan County, where he grew up.<p>  He attended Transylvania University and studied law under H. P. Broadnax and John J. Crittenden. Crittenden would prove a valuable connection. <p>  Crittenden served several terms in the state legislature, as governor, secretary of state, twice elected to the U.S. Senate, appointed attorney for the Illinois Territory and was U.S. attorney general in President Millard Fillmore's cabinet.<p>  Morehead passed the bar in 1818 and practiced law in Bowling Green. He also was elected a state representative from Warren County. <p>  He married Susan A. Roberts in 1823. They had two children.<p>  James Morehead made local newspaper headlines in 1832 when he ran for lieutenant governor. He was elected in what was an unusual voter selection as Morehead won under the political banner of the old National Republican Party, while John Breathitt was elected governor as a candidate for the rival Democratic-Republican Party.<p>  Breathitt, namesake of the Kentucky county, died midway through his term. Morehead, as lieutenant governor, thus became governor and was sworn in on Feb. 22, 1834.<p>  His term as governor was rather uneventful. After it ended, he practiced law in Frankfort.<p>  Morehead again made statewide headlines in January 1839 when he and John Speed Smith were sent to Ohio to try to negotiate help from Ohio officials in the return of escaped slaves. The Ohio legislature agreed and in March 1839 passed a law punishing anyone aiding or abetting an escaped slave with a fine up to $500 or 60 days in jail.<p>  Morehead's popularity was such that the next year, on May 25, 1840, he was selected as the main speaker at ceremonies marking the anniversary of the first Kentucky settlement at Fort Boonesborough.<p>  Morehead was then appointed to the U.S. Senate in February 1841 after his former mentor, Crittenden, was elected to the Senate but then resigned to accept the position of U.S. attorney general. Morehead served in the Senate through 1847.<p>  It was during Morehead's term as a U.S. senator that he moved to Covington. The Covington-based Licking Valley Register noted Morehead's arrival in a story on Sept. 9, 1843.<p>  ''Honorable James T. Morehead has taken up his residence in our city and we can not but congratulate our fellow citizens upon such an acquisition to our social circle.''<p>  The same newspaper noted two years later on Feb. 15, 1845, that Morehead had become the senior partner in a Covington law firm with John White Stevenson that would serve in the courts of Boone, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Harrison and Kenton counties. Their law office was on Market Street in rooms above the store of Cooper, Berry and Co.<p>  At the end of his Senate term, a reporter for the Philadelphia North American praised Morehead as one of the ablest people in the Senate and a rising star in the Whig Party. The writer said it would be up to voters if Morehead would obtain higher office. The New York Tribune also lauded Morehead for his tireless service in the Senate.<p>  Morehead, however, apparently had no further political ambitions. He told the Licking Valley Register he was out of politics and would devote his time to the law.<p>  Tragedy hit Morehead's family in May 1849, when his daughter, Maria, still just a young woman, died in Covington after an illness of eight days.<p>  In addition to law, Morehead became involved in banking and education while in Covington. Newspaper accounts in 1849 list him among a group of local business leaders seeking a state charter for a bank and in 1850 he was listed as president of trustees for Covington Commercial College. The college offered classes in history and literature, mercantile law, bookkeeping, commercial correspondence and business.<p>  Also in 1850 Morehead's name appeared in a Covington Journal advertisement as the solicitor for the Kentucky Mutual Life Insurance Co., which had offices in Covington. And in August 1850 Morehead was among those who formed a library association in Covington.<p>  Despite his pleas of no longer being interested in politics, James Morehead's name popped up in January 1852 for an opening in the U.S. Senate, after the death of Henry Clay. The Covington Journal reported several people were considered, including Morehead, but finally after seven ballots the state legislature appointed Archibald Dixon to the seat.<p>  Despite that loss, the Covington Journal noted that in February 1852 Morehead's name was being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate. That did not happen, but Morehead that year appeared in the community of Carthage in Campbell County for a rally on behalf of local Whig Party candidates.<p>  Tragedy struck the Morehead family again in August 1852, when Morehead's son-in-law, John H. Gore, died. Gore, a brevet major in the Army and veteran of the Mexican War, had spent several years at the Newport Military Barracks. At the time of his death, he was aboard the steamer Golden Gate in the Bay of Panama as part of a contingent of soldiers from the 4th Regiment on their way to assignment in California.<p>  James Morehead died on Dec. 28, 1854, in Covington, at the age of 57.<p>  The Covington Journal said Morehead died from a ''painful and wasting disease, which baffled the best medical skill.''<p>  The same account termed Morehead a ''profound jurist, an exemplary citizen, a devoted friend . . . remarkable for his social virtues and his charming conversational powers.''<p>  The local bar and Masonic groups held special services in his honor.<p>  The decision was made to bury Morehead at the Frankfort Cemetery with full state honors. But the arrangements took a long time in developing and his funeral in Frankfort did not take place until June 1855 - more than five months after his death.<p>  The city of Morehead, established in 1856, was named in James Morehead's honor.<p>  -<p>  Charles S. Morehead<p>  He was born in Nelson County on July 7, 1802, the son of Charles and Margaret Slaughter Morehead.<p>  He graduated from Transylvania University and became an attorney. He married twice, first to Amanda Leavy in 1823. After she died, Morehead married her sister, Margaret in 1831.<p>  He was elected to the state legislature in 1828 and became state attorney general in 1830. He later served in the U.S. House of Representatives and in July 1851 was the featured orator at the celebration in Maysville of the completion of the Maysville and Lexington Railroad.<p>  In the 1850s he joined the American Party, which was anti-immigrant in general and anti-Catholic in particular. As an American Party candidate he was elected governor in 1855. The Covington Journal described him that year as a man of conservative views, devotion to the union, considerable national experience and purity of life.<p>  A Covington Journal account in September 1858 said the governor was visiting Covington and staying at the Magnolia House, a hotel on Madison Avenue.<p>  A critic of Abraham Lincoln, Charles Morehead was a Kentucky delegate to a peace commission convention held in Washington, D. C., in January 1861 to try to negotiate differences between northern and southern states. Four months later, after the Civil War began, Charles Morehead participated in a conference of border states in Frankfort that called for those states to remain neutral.<p>  When recruiting and fighting began in Kentucky, Morehead was arrested by federal officials in September 1861 and sent to Fort Lafayette in New York City as a suspected Confederate supporter. Later moved to Fort Warren in Boston, he was released in March 1862 and moved to England for the remainder of the Civil War.<p>  A local newspaper noted Charles Morehead's return from Europe in July 1867 and said he was staying in Covington with his son-in-law, Samuel Walker.<p>  Morehead settled in Mississippi and died in Greenville on Dec. 21, 1868. His body was returned to Kentucky and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery. His second wife, Margaret, died in 1871.<p>  -<p>  <h3>Samuel Walker gained fame in Chicago</h3><p>  <p>  The son-in-law of Charles S. Morehead, Samuel Walker, was a real estate agent, dry goods businessman in Covington and former treasurer of the Covington and Lexington Railroad. He and his wife lived at 185 E. Second St.<p>  The Walkers lived in Covington at least until 1872. They later moved to Chicago, where Samuel Walker died in April 1884. <p>  The Chicago Inter-Ocean newspaper at the time described Walker as one of the major real estate developers of the era in Chicago. The newspaper said:<p>  ''Of all the real estate operators whose faith has made or unmade them, as the case may be, Mr. Walker was at the foremost.<p>  ''With no public purse at his command, he did for Chicago what only the latest and we hope the last of the Napoleons had done for Paris, namely, transfer full-grown trees from their forest homes to form long avenues of shade in a great city.''<p>  The Chicago newspaper added: ''He is said to have owned not less than 1,500 acres of property at one time in the southwestern part of Chicago, now worth not less than $30,000,000.''<p>  -<p>  <I>The study of Northern Kentucky history is an avocation of staff writer Jim Reis, who covers suburban Kenton County for The Kentucky Post. </B></I><p>  Publication date: 07-21-97<br clear=all><p><font size=-1><center><a href="http://www.kypost.com/"><b>Return to the Front Page</b></a><p><font size=-1>&copy Copyright 1997, The Cincinnati Post.
