<p align="center"><font size="5">Nancy Agnus Wales Sigler Hankins</font> </p>
<p>The inclusion of Nancy Agnus Wales in the list of those buried at Chalybeate
Cemetery is speculation but is highly probable. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following is an obituary found on page 55 of <u>Abstracts of Obituaries
in the Western Christian Advocate 1834-1850</u>. It was compiled by Margaret R.
Waters, Dorthy Riker, and Doris Leistner.&nbsp; It was published by&nbsp; The
Family History Section, Indiana Historical Society, Indaianpolis, 1988.&nbsp;
This information was senst to me by Cousin Margaret N. Wallace Wilson (3562)
(1753 Chloe, 570 Martha, 140 Mary, 24 Amos, 3 John Sigler and Nancy Wales, 1
Jacob). </p>
<p>&quot;<b>SIGLER</b>, Nancy; b, Iredale Co., NC; d 27 Dec 39, 69th yr., Union
Co., KY;&nbsp; mar; Issue:, John; died at his home. [6 - 184; 6 Mar 40]&quot; </p>
<p>A more reader friendly form of this obituary is as follows.&nbsp; Nancy
Sigler was born in Iredale County, North Carolina, and died on December 27,
1839, in Union County, Kentucky.&nbsp; She was 69 years old and died at the home
of her son, John.&nbsp; The numbers in brackets probably indicate that it was in
volume 6 number 184 dated March 6, 1840. </p>
<p>Other than the misspelling of the name of the county in North Carolina, most
of the information in this obituary seems accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it says
that she was living with her son, John, which should probably be Jacob.&nbsp;
Nancy did have a son John but I have not yet found any information which
indicates that he ever lived in Union County, Kentucky.&nbsp; The Sigler Book
also indicates that Nancy was born in Pennsylvania and married in North
Carolina. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nancy Agnus Wales was the wife of John Sigler (3) and was the mother of&nbsp; </p>
<p> Phillip Sigler (23),&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Amos Mansfield Sigler (24) who married Elizabeth Alzira Holeman (38),&nbsp; </p>
<p> Jacob Sigler (25) who married Malinda Roberts,&nbsp; </p>
<p> Elizabeth Sigler (26) who first married Absolem Holeman (32) and then
William H. Sigler (80),&nbsp; </p>
<p> Hannah
Sigler (27) who first married Phillip Holeman (36) and then Alfred
Hart,&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>John Sigler (28)who first married Catherine Nall (70) and then Emma Buell,&nbsp; </p>
<p> Nancy J. Sigler (29)who married Joel Carner,&nbsp; </p>
<p> Jane W. Sigler (30) who married Lawrence Sigler Nall (68), and&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Margaret Peggy Sigler (31) who married John Sigler (81). </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to the Sigler Book, John Sigler (3) married Nancy Agnus Wales on
July 8, 1791, in Surry County, North Carolina.&nbsp; Her parents were George
Wales and Jane Irvin who were Quakers in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.&nbsp;
The family lived in Robertson County, Tennessee, until John died in 1819 at the
age of fifty.&nbsp; Nancy was about forty-five or fifty years old at the time
and had children ranging in age from six to twenty-seven.&nbsp; Shortly after
John died, Nancy moved with the children to Caldwell County, Kentucky, where
most of John's brothers and sisters were living.&nbsp; She arrived with at least
four children under the age of eighteen and had to find some way to raise them
by herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nancy married John Hankins on April 26, 1823, in Caldwell County, Kentucky,
and still had four children under the age of eighteen ranging in ages from ten
to seventeen.&nbsp; Three of the children were not married at the time of
Nancy's marriage to John Hankins.&nbsp; They were married by Edmund Wilcox
according to the rights and ceremonies of Methodist Episcopal Church.&nbsp;
Marriage records show parties of lawful age and hath been heretofore
married&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>While gathering information at the Union County, Kentucky, courthouse in
Morganfield concerning the estate of William D. French, whose stone is in the
Chalybeate Cemetery, I found a document which I feel provides a high degree of probability
that Nancy is also buried in the Chalybeate Cemetery. </p>
<p>In addition to the document on page 126, will book B, Union County, Kentucky,
(below) similar documents are found on pages 109 and 206, will book B, Union County,
Kentucky.&nbsp; There seemed to exist a well defined process to settle an estate
during the mid 1800's the same as there is a well defined estate settlement
process today. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On page 126, will book B, Union County, Kentucky, is the following document: </p>
<p>&quot;A list and amount of sales of the personal estate of Nancy Hankins
deceased this day sold by Jacob Sigler her administrator to wit&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;The list indicates that Hannah Holeman purchased a frying pan and a tea
kettle for 25 cents and 18 cents respectively.&nbsp; The list indicates that L.
S. Nall purchased an umbrella for $1.00.&nbsp; The list indicates that John P.
Lynn purchased a bed and bedstead of furniture for $20.12.&nbsp; The list
indicates that Jacob Sigler purchased a blanket, a bed dish, a side saddle and
an onan?? for $5.12, $4.12, $15.00, and $23.00.&nbsp; The list indicates that
Enoch Morehead purchased a chest for $2.75.&nbsp; The total sales was
$72.06.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;At a county court began and held for Union County at the courthouse in
Morganfield on Monday the 20th day of April 1840 this list of sales of the
estate of Nancy Hankins deceased was turned into&nbsp; by the administrator and
ordered to be recorded which now thereupon recorded accordingly.&nbsp; Attest
Samuel (unreadable).&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>To me this would indicate that Nancy was living in Union County, Kentucky,
and a member of the Chalybeate Community at the time of her death.&nbsp; The
most appropriate place for burial would be at the in the Chalybeate
Cemetery.&nbsp; It is unknown where Nancy's first husband, John Sigler, is
buried or where her second husband's (John Hankins) children buried him. </p>
