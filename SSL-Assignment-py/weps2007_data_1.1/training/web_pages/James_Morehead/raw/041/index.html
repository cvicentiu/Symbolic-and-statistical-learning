<p align="center"><img src="ky1855.jpg" width="396" height="572" border="1"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rowan County, the 104th county in order of formation, is located 
  in the mountains of northeastern Kentucky. It is bounded by Fleming, Lewis, 
  Carter, Elliott, Morgan, Menifee, and Bath counties and has an area of 282 square 
  miles. Rowan County was formed from sections of Fleming and Morgan counties 
  in 1856. The county was named for John Rowan, who represented Kentucky in the 
  U.S. House of Representatives (1807-09) and the U.S. Senate (1825-31). The county 
  seat is Morehead, the largest city in the county.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">According to Fred Brown and Juanita Blair in their book, <em>The 
  Story of Two Kentucky Feuds</em>, (2000), &quot;The village of Morehead was 
  laid out in 1856, the year Rowan County was formed, but not incorporated until 
  1869. Rowan's formation came about as a political ply to prevent Fleming County's 
  county seat from being moved to Poplar Plains. The resulting county effectively 
  removed sufficient agitators from the fray. Centrally located, Morehead presided 
  over a county rich in steep wooded hillsides - and little else.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The topography of the county is hilly to mountainous. Most 
  of the county is part of the Daniel Boone National Forest and has extensive 
  hardwood forests. Only 32 percent of the county land is farmland; 35 percent 
  is government-owned. Natural resources include timber, limestone, clay, and 
  some coal. The principal water source is the Licking River and its impoundment, 
  Cave Run Lake, which together form the county's southwestern border. Triplett 
  Creek is the major tributary in the county.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is believed that a party of surveyors from Pennsylvania, 
  led by George William Thompson, first explored the area around Triplett Creek 
  in the summer of 1773. The first settlers of the area came mostly from Virginia 
  to claim land grants for service in the Revolutionary War. Many of these people 
  settled in fertile valleys along the Licking River and Triplett Creek. One of 
  the first communities to develop was Farmers, located in the western part of 
  the county on the Licking River. It was settled by Maj. Jim Brain, who established 
  a hotel at the junction of two roads. Clearfield, located just south of Morehead, 
  was settled by Dixon Clack in the early nineteenth century and grew around his 
  water-powered sawmill and store. Morehead was probably the third community to 
  be established in the county and likewise grew around a sawmill, which was operated 
  by Jake Wilson. It became the county seat when Rowan County was founded in 1856.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="EARLYMOREHEAD.jpg" width="832" height="381" border="1"></p>
<p><font size="+1">By the 1860s Rowan County was made up of a scattering of small 
  communities. Corn was the dominant crop and timbering the major industry, with 
  logs floated down Triplett Creek and the Licking River. During the Civil War, 
  the residents of the county were often threatened with attack by guerrillas 
  who, on March 21, 1864, burned the new county courthouse. On June 12, 1864, 
  Gen. John Hunt Morgan's Confederate cavalry camped near Farmers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Three hundred Confederate cavalry under Col. Peter Everett 
  passed through Eastern Kentucky in order to attack the Union supply depot at 
  Maysville, where, on June 14th, they captured 50 horses, 330 rifles, and 25 
  pistols. On the next day, near Olympian Springs in Bath County, they ambushed 
  Major R. T. Williams and thirty men of the 14th Kentucky Cavalry, killing eleven 
  and capturing twelve. On June 16th, 1863, two battalions of the 10th Kentucky 
  Cavalry led by Lt. Col. R. R. Maltby overtook Colonel Everett&#8217;s command 
  at Triplett&#8217;s Creek Bridge near Morehead in Rowan County. Maltby&#8217;s 
  men surrounded the Confederates, defeated them, and took 38 prisoners. When 
  DeCourcey&#8217;s 8th Michigan Cavalry arrived on the scene, mistaking Maltby&#8217;s 
  men for the enemy, Evertt and the rest of his men slipped away and returned 
  to their base in Russell County, Virginia.</font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">Although stone, coal, and timber were the county's main resources, 
  they were not exploited in great quantities until the Elizabethtown, Lexington 
  &amp; Big Sandy Railroad arrived in the county in the early 1880s. The town 
  of Farmers expanded quickly and was the largest city in the county until most 
  of the timber was depleted around 1900. Rodburn, Eadston, and Brady also grew 
  as lumber towns situated on the railroad. Rockville and Bluestone developed 
  as rock quarry centers.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">To serve the mining and logging operations, several small railroads 
  were built in Rowan County. The largest was the Morehead &amp; North Fork Railroad 
  (later abandoned), which by 1908 connected the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad 
  at Morehead with Redwine in Morgan County. Numerous tributary spur lines extending 
  from it moved products of the mills and mines to Morehead. Two other short lines 
  in the county were the Kentucky Northern Railroad, which hauled logs from 1896 
  until its abandonment in 1900, and the Christy Creek Railroad, built by the 
  General Refractories Company to haul clay from 1920 until 1948, when it was 
  abandoned.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Martin-Tolliver feud, known as the Rowan County War, focused 
  national attention on the county. After three years it ended in a bloody gun 
  battle in Morehead on June 22, 1887. In an unsuccessful attempt to stop the 
  fighting, the General Assembly took the unusual measure of proposing to dissolve 
  Rowan County unless the feud stopped.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Prompted by donations from a former Confederate soldier, Morehead 
  Normal School was founded in 1887 by Phoebe Button. In 1922 the school gained 
  state support and in 1966 became known as Morehead State University. MOONLIGHT 
  SCHOOLS were first established in Rowan County in 1911 to give night instruction 
  to pupils of all ages. The founder, Cora Wilson Stewart, was credited with making 
  great strides in the fight against illiteracy in the area.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As the timber resources in the county were exhausted, clay 
  deposits were mined on a large scale. The town of Haldeman was founded five 
  miles northeast of Morehead by L.P. Haldeman to accommodate workers of his Kentucky 
  Firebrick Co., which opened before 1907. The plant closed during the Great Depression. 
  Lee Clay Products, which purchased the assets of the Clearfield Lumber Company 
  in 1925, produced clay sewer and chimney pipe until the 1970s.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">By the 1950s, tobacco had replaced corn as the county's leading 
  farm crop. Corn, hay, poultry, and cattle are also raised. When I-64 was completed 
  through the somewhat isolated area in 1969, some industrial growth was experienced. 
  In 1990 the leading employer in the county was Morehead State University. A 
  boost to tourism was the 1974 impoundment of Cave Run Lake. The 8,200-acre lake 
  is the largest in eastern Kentucky.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The population of Rowan County was 17,010 in 1970; 19,049 in 
  1980; and 20,353 in 1990.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">When Rowan County was a part of Fleming County, 
  in 1791, Jacob Powers and Barnett Simmons came here from Virginia. Both were 
  men of considerable wealth and owned many slaves. Jacob Powers was the grandfather 
  of H. M. Logan. At this time Lewis D. Lee owned the farm now known as the Marion 
  Tolliver farm and donated the ground for what is now the Lee Cemetery. Ben Evans 
  lived in the log house which stood on the property now occupied by Cornelious 
  Caudill. He was the father of Mrs. Boone Logan of Pineville, Ky. Uncle Tom Trumbo 
  lived across Triplett Creek in the house burned. Aunt Polly Cassity lived on 
  and owned quite a boundary of land in the west end of Morehead, later known 
  as the Judge J. W. Riley farm. Mr. William Nickell, grandfather of George and 
  William Nickell was one of the early settlers. Mrs. Libby Oxley, grandmother 
  of George and William Nickell, owned much of the land on which Morehead now 
  stands, and lived on the site now occupied by Will Hogge's store. E. Houston 
  Logan, father of Mrs. Queen Clark, lived on what is known as the Frank Nickell 
  farm now owned by Dr. A. L. Blair. Ben Johnson built the house occupied for 
  a time by Can Caudill next to the Masonic building. Elias Bradley, familiarly 
  known as Grandfather Bradley, owned the land where Clearfield now stands. Mr. 
  James Black also owned much land here. William Logan was one of the most prosperous 
  men of the <img src="RowanCountylogCabin1940.JPG" width="463" height="309" border="1" align="right">county. 
  All of the above named people lived here before the Civil War. In 1854 Colonel 
  Hargis came here and purchased from Mrs. Oxley, the land and marked out the 
  town of Morehead, after Governor Morehead, one of Kentucky's early governors. 
  The county was then cut off from Fleming and Morgan Counties and named Rowan, 
  after Judge John R. Rowan of Fleming County. The first offices elected were 
  James Black, jailer, Isaac Johnson, sheriff. Then came the Civil War and but 
  little progress was made for some time. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other early arrivals in Morehead were; 1869, James E. Clark, 
  father of Mrs. J. W. Riley. 1870, Doctor Banfield. 1871, Z. T. Young, 1873, 
  H. M. Logan, 1874, Grandfather Carey, 1875 Harry Burns, 1876 James Moody, 1880 
  Uncle Cloy Powers, 1881 Mr. Hamilton, 1882 Dr. Raine, 1887 Dr. Frank C. Button

<p><font size="+1">&quot;Rowan County has a claim to distinction that no other 
  county in Kentucky has, even including Nelson, where &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; 
  is located. For of all the counties in the state of Kentucky, Rowan has the 
  good fortune to be named in honor of the founder and establisher of the beautiful 
  brick home near Bardstown, the home in which Stephen Foster penned his immortal 
  song, the mecca for loyal Kentuckians, thousands of whom visit the shrine each 
  year.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Judge Rowan was the uncle of Stephen Foster, who spent many 
  years of his life and who wrote most of his great and enduring songs while visiting 
  at the home in Bardstown..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The boundaries of Rowan County on its inception were as follows. 
  &quot;That from and after the first day of May 1856 so much of the counties 
  of Fleming and Morgan as lies with the following boundaries shall be and the 
  same is hereby erected into and established a separate and distinct county to 
  be called Rowan, viz: Beginning at the Elk Lick on the Licking River near Fielding 
  Cooper's in Fleming County; running thence up the Licking to the mouth of North 
  Fork of the said river, in Morgan county; thence up said North Fork of said 
  river to the mouth of Creek called Miner's Creek; thence up said creek to the 
  mouth of a branch running by the residence of </font></p>

  thence down a creek called Laurel Creek, to the mouth of Bate's branch; thence 
  with the ridge east of Bate's branch to the head of the twin branches of Caney 
  Creek, to the line of Carter County to the boundary line between Cart and Fleming 
  counties, to the point at which the boundary lines of Carter, Lewis and Fleming 
  counties intersect each other, thence, with the boundary between Fleming and 
  Lewis counties to the head of the east fork of Fox's Creek; and thence with 
  the dividing ridge, between the waters of Fox and Triplett Creeks to the beginning.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The seat of justice for Rowan County was designated on the 
  east fork of Triplett Creek at a point agreed upon by the commissioners and 
  to be between the residences of Dixon Clack and B. F. Powers. The name of the 
  seat of justice was to be Morehead, in honor of James T. Morehead, at one time 
  Governor of Kentucky. The commissioners selected to locate the city of Morehead 
  were Harvey T. Wilson, William Mynhier, George W. Crawford, Mason Williams and 
  William Grannis. Among these names are some that still make up some of the names 
  to be found in the county at the present time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The commissioners met at the house of Dixon Clack March 1856. 
  There findings were to be written up and given to E. H. Logan or B. F. Powers 
  and this certificate to be handed to the County Court Clerk and whose duty it 
  was to record in records of the county and a duplicate sent to the Secretary 
  of State of the Commonwealth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The county was divided into four districts in each was to be 
  elected two justices of the Peace and one constable, which districts shall be 
  the election districts; Dixon Clack, Isaac E. Johnson, B. F. Powers and M. C. 
  Royce were appointed commissioners to lay off the above districts..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Judge Hargis stepped of the land which is now used as the public 
  grounds in Morehead. Rowan County was given the right to use the jail of Fleming 
  County until a jail was built in Morehead.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The city of Morehead was incorporated January 26, 1869, even 
  though it was laid out as early as 1856.. It had a population of about 200. 
  Today this growing Metropolis boasts of a thriving city of close to 2,000 population 
  and a resident student body of 1000 to 1400 from all sections, in a $2,000,000 
  school plant. Practically every street in the city is paved, whereby not over 
  15 years ago, many oxen were seen lying in the mud on the main thoroughfare. 
  The early type home has given way to modern homes and supplied by modern conveniences.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first member of the legislature from Rowan County was Harrison 
  G. Burns, who served from 1859 to 1861. Up to 1874, there had been no resident 
  Senator from Rowan County but since then Rowan County has supplied the legislature 
  with some of the leading statesmen and among the more recent and noted one, 
  was our own Senator Allie W. Young, who gave to the district many things that 
  stood out as monuments to his labor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The count was once covered with vast resources of timber and 
  furnished millions of board feet of the nation's best hardwood. Many saw mills 
  working throughout the county, furnished the supply of lumber.</font></p>

  Rowan County</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By SUE LOWE</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> (Information for this article was obtained from pamphlets 
  and a written account of Rowan County's history by J. H. Powers, both located 
  in the Kentucky Room at Johnson Camden Library.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Although Morehead is the county seat of Rowan, other settlements 
  were larger and more progressive in Rowan's early history.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Farmers was the first settlement in Rowan. It quickly grew 
  into a booming river town because of its industry.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Located ten miles west of Morehead, it was first named Cross 
  Roads because it was situated where the road running parallel to the Licking 
  River crossed with the road running east and west.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As early as 1792, settlers came to Cross Roads after receiving 
  land grants from the United States Government for their services and patronage 
  in American Revolution. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The settlers kept pouring into Cross Roads. Its population 
  increased rapidly because of its river location, fertile farming land, and the 
  abundance of virgin timber alongside the Licking River.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before the coming of the Elizabethtown, Lexington and Big Sandy 
  Railroad in 1882, Cross Roads and Morehead were the only incorporated towns 
  in the county. The town of Cross Roads changed its name to Farmers with the 
  advent of the railroad.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The railroad later sold out to the Cheasapeake and Ohio Railway 
  Company {C &amp; O}. Farmers still remained the largest town in the county.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
  <strong>Industry at Farmers</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Farmers, being a river town, was the industrial center of the 
  county. There were several saw mills in Farmers. The largest were the Keystone 
  Lumber Company, J. R. Buchwalter Company, and the P. L. Reese Company.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In 1845, the town sent an estimated 35 - 50 soldiers to fight 
  in the Mexican War.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In 1896, a tax of $500 per saloon was levied in Morehead. The 
  tax provided money to construct hard surface roads in the town. In 1920 the 
  road was extended to Farmers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also in the 1890's, settlers from New York constructed a stone 
  mill at Bluestone where native stone was sawed for building purposes. The mill 
  was later forced out of operation in 1930 because of the increased use of limestone 
  and concrete for construction.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In 1903 or 1904, a German-owned company manufactured several 
  million barrel staves on the headwaters of Licking River. These barrel staves 
  were shipped back to Germany.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The company employed Nim Coburn and Frank Prater to bring the 
  staves down the river to Farmers. The men would wait for the high tide to throw 
  all of the staves in the river. Then they would follow behind the staves in 
  boats for an estimated 100 miles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Coburn and Prater were so successful that they had to hire 
  additional men to help them. Booms were constructed across the river at Farmers 
  to catch the staves as they floated down. Few staves were lost.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the timber was exhausted along the Licking River, the 
  mills were destroyed. The townspeople began to move on to seek employment elsewhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
  <strong>Second Settlement</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
  Clearfield, the second settlement in the county, had the first and largest saw 
  mill.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Settlers were attracted to Clearfield because of the abundance 
  of fish and wildlife.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the early 1800's, settlement began at Clearfield. Dixon 
  Clack, an old Virginia aristocrat, erected the first, or one of the first, homes 
  built in Clearfield. Clack Mountain was one of the boundaries of his property.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In 1820, Jacob Clack erected a saw mill at Clearfield. The 
  mill was operated by water power.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Settlers by the name of Deadman received land grants and became 
  prominent persons in Clearfield's early history.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In 1905, the Clearfield Lumber Company was founded by a Pennsylvania 
  corporation. This mill, along with the smaller mills, took all the virgin timber 
  in the county. The mill operated for seventeen years and it employed 300 men. 
  It was located at the site of Lee Clay Products.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another large saw mill was erected in the county with the advent 
  of the railroad. The Hixon Rodburn Lumber Company was located at Rodburn and 
  was owned by settlers from New York. The mill was destroyed by fire about 1896.</font></p>

<p>&quot;James T. Morehead, namesake of the Rowan County city for which Morehead 
  State University is named, was the first native-born Kentuckian elected governor. 
  He practiced law for many years in Covington and died here. He was born near 
  Shepherdsville on May 24, 1797, the son of Armistead and Lucy Latham Morehead. 
  When he was 3 the family moved to Russellville in Logan County, where he grew 
  up. He attended Transylvania University and studied law under H. P. Broadnax 
  and John J. Crittenden. Crittenden would prove a valuable connection. </p>
<p>Crittenden served several terms in the state legislature, as governor, secretary 
  of state, twice elected to the U.S. Senate, appointed attorney for the Illinois 
  Territory and was U.S. attorney general in President Millard Fillmore's cabinet. 
  Morehead passed the bar in 1818 and practiced law in Bowling Green. He also 
  was elected a state representative from Warren County. He married Susan A. Roberts 
  in 1823. They had two children.</p>
<p>James Morehead made local newspaper headlines in 1832 when he ran for lieutenant 
  governor. He was elected in what was an unusual voter selection as Morehead 
  won under the political banner of the old National Republican Party, while John 
  Breathitt was elected governor as a candidate for the rival Democratic-Republican 
  Party. Breathitt, namesake of the Kentucky county, died midway through his term. 
  Morehead, as lieutenant governor, thus became governor and was sworn in on Feb. 
  22, 1834. His term as governor was rather uneventful. After it ended, he practiced 
  law in Frankfort.</p>
<p>Morehead again made statewide headlines in January 1839 when he and John Speed 
  Smith were sent to Ohio to try to negotiate help from Ohio officials in the 
  return of escaped slaves. The Ohio legislature agreed and in March 1839 passed 
  a law punishing anyone aiding or abetting an escaped slave with a fine up to 
  $500 or 60 days in jail. Morehead's popularity was such that the next year, 
  on May 25, 1840, he was selected as the main speaker at ceremonies marking the 
  anniversary of the first Kentucky settlement at Fort Boonesborough.</p>
<p>Morehead was then appointed to the U.S. Senate in February 1841 after his former 
  mentor, Crittenden, was elected to the Senate but then resigned to accept the 
  position of U.S. attorney general. Morehead served in the Senate through 1847. 
  It was during Morehead's term as a U.S. senator that he moved to Covington. 
  The Covington-based Licking Valley Register noted Morehead's arrival in a story 
  on Sept. 9, 1843.</p>
<p>''Honorable James T. Morehead has taken up his residence in our city and we 
  can not but congratulate our fellow citizens upon such an acquisition to our 
  social circle.''</p>
<p>The same newspaper noted two years later on Feb. 15, 1845, that Morehead had 
  become the senior partner in a Covington law firm with John White Stevenson 
  that would serve in the courts of Boone, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Harrison 
  and Kenton counties. Their law office was on Market Street in rooms above the 
  store of Cooper, Berry and Co.</p>
<p>At the end of his Senate term, a reporter for the Philadelphia North American 
  praised Morehead as one of the ablest people in the Senate and a rising star 
  in the Whig Party. The writer said it would be up to voters if Morehead would 
  obtain higher office. The New York Tribune also lauded Morehead for his tireless 
  service in the Senate.</p>
<p>Morehead, however, apparently had no further political ambitions. He told the 
  Licking Valley Register he was out of politics and would devote his time to 
  the law. Tragedy hit Morehead's family in May 1849, when his daughter, Maria, 
  still just a young woman, died in Covington after an illness of eight days.</p>
<p>In addition to law, Morehead became involved in banking and education while 
  in Covington. Newspaper accounts in 1849 list him among a group of local business 
  leaders seeking a state charter for a bank and in 1850 he was listed as president 
  of trustees for Covington Commercial College. The college offered classes in 
  history and literature, mercantile law, bookkeeping, commercial correspondence 
  and business. Also in 1850 Morehead's name appeared in a Covington Journal advertisement 
  as the solicitor for the Kentucky Mutual Life Insurance Co., which had offices 
  in Covington. And in August 1850 Morehead was among those who formed a library 
  association in Covington.</p>
<p>Despite his pleas of no longer being interested in politics, James Morehead's 
  name popped up in January 1852 for an opening in the U.S. Senate, after the 
  death of Henry Clay. The Covington Journal reported several people were considered, 
  including Morehead, but finally after seven ballots the state legislature appointed 
  Archibald Dixon to the seat. Despite that loss, the Covington Journal noted 
  that in February 1852 Morehead's name was being mentioned as a possible vice 
  presidential candidate. That did not happen, but Morehead that year appeared 
  in the community of Carthage in Campbell County for a rally on behalf of local 
  Whig Party candidates. Tragedy struck the Morehead family again in August 1852, 
  when Morehead's son-in-law, John H. Gore, died. Gore, a brevet major in the 
  Army and veteran of the Mexican War, had spent several years at the Newport 
  Military Barracks. At the time of his death, he was aboard the steamer Golden 
  Gate in the Bay of Panama as part of a contingent of soldiers from the 4th Regiment 
  on their way to assignment in California.</p>
<p>James Morehead died on Dec. 28, 1854, in Covington, at the age of 57. The Covington 
  Journal said Morehead died from a ''painful and wasting disease, which baffled 
  the best medical skill.'' The same account termed Morehead a ''profound jurist, 
  an exemplary citizen, a devoted friend . . . remarkable for his social virtues 
  and his charming conversational powers.'' The local bar and Masonic groups held 
  special services in his honor. The decision was made to bury Morehead at the 
  Frankfort Cemetery with full state honors. But the arrangements took a long 
  time in developing and his funeral in Frankfort did not take place until June 
  1855 - more than five months after his death. The city of Morehead, established 
  in 1856, was named in James Morehead's honor.&quot;</p>
