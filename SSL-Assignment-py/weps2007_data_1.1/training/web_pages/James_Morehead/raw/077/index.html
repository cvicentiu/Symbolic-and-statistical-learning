Morehead, James B. <B>In My Sights: The Memoir of a P-40 Ace</B>. Novato, CA: Presidio Press, 1998.
<P>
ISBN 0-89141-534-X<BR>
201 pages
<P>
Preface; Acknowledgments; maps; photos; Epilogue.
<P>
James Morehead grew up dirt-poor, little more than an enslaved laborer on his abusive father's dust bowl farm in Depression-era Oklahoma, and he seems -- perhaps understandably -- to have come out of that background with a chip on his shoulder and little patience for slights, real or imagined, from anyone in or out of the service.
<P>
Although it is not much mentioned in this autobiography, he was accorded the nickname "Wildman" and, while the origin of the name is not explained, almost every page of the book proves that such a moniker suited him well.
<P>
Perhaps the nickname had something to do with his propensity for fighting. During the course of the book he beats up a clerk in an office, a driver giving him a ride to Washington, his buddy (and it actually turns out to be his buddy's twin brother) for being late to a meeting on a street corner in San Francisco, a superior officer in a barracks in Australia, a young lieutenant in a mess hall, and comes close to fisticuffs with several others over more or less trivial matters.
<P>
Perhaps the nickname had something to do with his flying style. Morehead seems to be a damn good pilot -- a highly decorated ace with victories against both Japanese and German aircraft -- but the same attitude that gets him into fights might be responsible for a near accident as a cadet (queasy from too much exhaust in his face), bailing out of a burning plane on a training flight near Santa Rosa, bailing out into San Francisco Bay after a mid-air collision on another training flight, a landing accident in which the prop of his plane chops his best buddy into pieces, nearly diving into the ground (and almost leading his flight with him) when he falls asleep in the cockpit, nearly flipping tail over nose during one landing, and overshooting the runway and crash-landing in a wheat field in Italy during another.
<P>
Maybe the nickname had something to do with the way he lived off-duty. When he wasn't hunting birds, kangaroo, wallabies, and other local game with his trusty.22, he was hunting (and lovingly describing) the local game that wears skirts. Oh, and there was also the occasion on which he wing-walked on a bi-plane trainer while his buddy buzzed their airfield.
<P>
Or perhaps the nickname had something to do with the way he dove his P-40 into enemy bomber formations over Java in early 1942 when Zeros ruled the sky and his squadron was melting away day by day under the guns of the escorting Japanese fighters, and his chief goal in life was "to lower the boom on those back-stabbing, sneaking, brutal snakes in the night that murdered my countrymen by pretending to deal in peace while they raised a bloody knife to stab us with."
<P>
An interesting memoir, especially for the descriptions of action in Java -- where Morehead was one of relatively few American fighter pilots to survive and escape -- and Port Darwin, Australia.
<P>
Available from online booksellers, local bookshops, or directly from Presidio Press.
