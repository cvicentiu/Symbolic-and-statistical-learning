<p><b>PREFACE</b></p>

<p>The following compilation of the records embracing the several
families of which I am a descendent, was commenced by me some
years ago when my wife and daughter, and others of my family
became interested in the patriotic society of the Sons and
Daughters of the Revolution. After obtaining the necessary data
for them to become members of the Society, I became greatly
interested in further investigation.</p>

<p>I commenced with my father's records and pursued it on to the
present branch.</p>

<p>Much of the following is traditional, but I feel sure it is as
nearly correct as it can now be known after the lapse of so many
years.</p>

<p>I have verified the Coats of Arms of the Turners, Warders, and
Moreheads, having obtained the General Armory of England,
Scotland, Ireland and Wales, comprising a registry of Armorial
bearings from the earliest to the present time by Sir Bernard
Burke, C. B. L. L. D., London, England, and find them correct as
we have them. I also find the Elliotts, Morris and Pepers, that
have been handed down to us traditionally agree with the Burke
registry, above referred to.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to state that I have published these
records in book form for the information and pleasure of my
grandchildren and all those of my relations, who desire to learn
of their ancestry, feeling sure the same will be appreciated by
one and all of them. All the matter in reference to myself is
intended particularly for my grandchildren.</p>

<p align="center"><b>MOREHEAD FAMILY</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>(No. 234.)</b></p>

<p>Perhaps no family of Virginia has become more widespread,
North, South, East and West, all springing from the first
emigrant to Virginia in 1630, than the Morehead family. The
origin of the name is one of location, that is: &quot;Moor&#146;s
Head&quot; in England, and by dropping the middle letters easily
assumes its present form, but they have been early located in
Scotland, from whence the first emigrant, Charles Morehead, came
and located in the Northern Neck of Virginia, about 1630. That
they were men of affluence and connected with the peerage is
shown by their coat of arms, as given below, and being quite
significant in design, described as follows: &quot;Argent, on a
bend, azure, three acorns, or in chief a man&#146;s heart, ppr.
within a fetterlock, sable, the whole surrounded with an oak
wreath, ppr. acorned, or Crest, two hands conjoined, grasping a
two-handed sword, ppr. Motto--Auxilio Dei (By Divine Aid).&quot;</p>

<p>Here is an escutcheon which will puzzle the student of
heraldry to interpret, and yet, it is said that it fully
described the various characteristics of this family in their
boldness and bravery and open-hearted aspirations for the cause
of religion and civilization wherever they have been.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Charles Morehead was the first in
the colony. Hening speaks of him in his eighth volume, and also
gives his wife&#146;s name as Jane. Yet little is known of his
family and not until 1767 do we find that a Captain Charles
Morehead recorded as being in the Colonial Militia from Fauquier
County, evidently a grandson of the first Charles (See Virginia
Historical Magazine). The family seems to have settled early in
Spotsylvania and Fauquier, as in the former County Captain Turner
Morehead enlisted and served in the Third Virginia Regiment in
the fall of 1776, from Fauquier, which marched to Pennsylvania,
joining the main army under General Marshall and thence to
Brandywine. This Turner Morehead left descendants in Fauquier, as
is found among the Court records, but that there were few of the
family then left in Virginia is from the fact that after the
Revolution Turner Morehead moved to Kentucky, where the most of
his children were married and rose to distinction in that State.
One of his nephews, Charles Slaughter Morehead, became Governor
of the State; was also a member of Congress. James Turner
Morehead, another nephew, was in the United States Senate from
that State; was also Governor, and was brilliant lawyer. General
S. B. Buckner, a grandson was Governor of Kentucky. John Motley
Morehead, another of the Northern Neck descendants, moved to
North Carolina, where by his legal ability he was elected
Governor in 1845, and was President of the Old National Whig
Convention, which nominated General Zachary Taylor for the
President of the United States in 1848. His brother, James Turner
Morehead, was a member of Congress from North Carolina.</p>

<p align="center"><b>RECORD OF CHARLES R. MOREHEAD, SENIOR</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>OF LEXINGTON, MISSOURI.</b></p>

<p>My great-great-grandfather, Charles Morehead, emigrated from
Scotland and settled in the Northern Neck of Virginia about the
year 1630. Of the descendants of the first Charles Morehead, I
only know the name of John. My grandfather, Charles Morehead, was
the oldest son of John Morehead, who lived in Fauquier County,
Virginia. I married Miss Mary Turner of Spotsylvania County,
Virginia, who was the daughter of James Turner and his wife
Kerenhappuck Norman Turner.</p>

<p>The children of John Morehead will be found later on in the
Records of Fauquier County, Virginia.</p>

<p>I know all my uncles and aunts on my father&#146;s side,
except my uncle James, Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Ransdell. Mrs. Clark
died leaving no children. Mrs. Ransdell died in Virginia, also
her husband, leaving two children, Charles and Wharton.</p>

<p>After the Revolutionary War my grandmother, Mary Turner
Morehead, and all her children then living &#151; except my
father, Mrs. Clark and her two grandchildren &#151; migrated to
Kentucky in 1807. Mrs. Donaldson was the only child then married,
who migrated. My father remained in Virginia until 1811.</p>

<p>The migrating party embarked at Brownsville, Pennsylvania,
(then called Redstone) on a flat-bottomed boat. A Capt. Brisco
commanding. They descended the Monongahela to Pittsburg and the
Ohio to the Falls (Now Louisville, Ky.) from thence to Bardstown,
Nelson County, Kentucky. Here my grandmother died; subsequently
the surviving members of the family moved to Southern Kentucky,
then called the Green River country and settled in what is now
Warren and Logan Counties. The whole country south of Green River
was then Logan County and Russelville the county seat. My uncle
Armistead was the first clerk of the Courts of that county, in
which capacity he served many years.</p>

<p>When my father moved to Kentucky in 1811, his two sisters,
Mrs. Donaldson and Mrs. Briggs, were living in Warren County and
his three brothers, Charles, Armistead and Presley were living in
Logan County. My father after remaining in Bowling Green one year
settled in Barron County, Kentucky, where he died February 23rd,
1820.</p>

<p>Much of what I state regarding the migration of the family
from Virginia to Kentucky was gathered from my beloved Aunt
Kerenhappuck Donaldson, with whom I boarded several years, when a
storeboy at Bowling Green. She was a model woman of her day,
beloved and respected not only by connections, but by all who
knew her, the same may be said of her sister, Mrs. Elizabeth
Briggs. They were both idolized by all the connections.</p>

<p>Charles Morehead, the second, married a Miss Mary Norman of
Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Their children are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><ol>
            <li>Turner Morehead was born on the seventh day of
                January, 1757 and married his first wife, Ann
                Ransdale on the seventh of June, 1779. She was
                born on the second of August, 1756. The date of
                her death I do not know. Turner Morehead died on
                his farm in Barron County, Kentucky. He was a
                soldier of the Revolution during the greater part
                of the war, most of the time a Captain. He bore
                several scars received in the battles during the
                war. He was a farmer most of his life and was in
                addition pretty largely engaged in milling, in
                both of which occupations he prospered. He was
                remarkable for his morality and
                conscientiousness. Was hospitable and kind to all
                with whom he came in contact, was very popular
                with his friends and neighbors, although very
                firm and decided in his opinions.</li>
            <li>Mary Morehead was born July 15th, 1759. She was
                married to Wharton Ransdell in Virginia and died
                there.</li>
            <li>Charles Morehead, the third, was born February
                3rd, 1762. He married a Miss Slaughter of
                Culpeper County, Virginia, and raised a large
                family, all daughters, except one, (Charles S.
                Morehead, Ex. Gov. of Kentucky). He was a farmer,
                a man highly respected, having served his country
                in the Legislature of Kentucky, frequently in
                both the House and the Senate. He and his wife
                both died in Logan County, Kentucky. He also was
                a soldier in Lee's Legion, &quot;Light Horse
                Harry's Brigade.&quot; Was at the surrender of
                Cornwallis, as I have heard from himself and my
                father.</li>
            <li>Kerenhappuck Morehead was born September 10th,
                1764. She married Daniel Donaldson, who died in
                Bowling Green, Kentucky about the year of 1816,
                leaving her a widow with considerable family. She
                died March 27th, 1835.</li>
            <li>Armistead Morehead was born June 4th, 1767. He
                married a Miss Latham. He was the father of James
                T. Morehead, once Governor of Kentucky and
                subsequently United States Senator from that
                State. He was a large portion of his life engaged
                in mercantile pursuits besides being clerk for
                many years of the Court of Logan County,
                Kentucky. He was also in the latter part of his
                life cashier of two separate banks in Bowling
                Green, Kentucky.</li>
            <li>James Morehead was born July 27th, 1771. He was
                married and died in Nelson County, Kentucky.</li>
            <li>Presley Morehead was born November 25th, 1775. He
                married a Miss Duncan and raised a large family.
                He was a farmer and represented the county of
                Logan in the State Senate of Kentucky several
                times.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Morehead was born November 19th, 1773.
                She married Thompson Briggs, a farmer and a much
                respected man in his day. He died leaving her a
                widow with a large family of children, mostly
                grown. He died in Warren County, Kentucky. She
                also died in the same county.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Of my grandmothers, Mary Turner Morehead&#146;s family I have
never known personally, but one of the name, who was a
connection, he was a Dr. Turner of Columbia, Tenn.</p>

<p>Before my father's removal from Virginia, I remember he
visited North Carolina to see his connections. I have heard him
often speak of the Turners, Sanfords, Smiths and Morehead
connections in that State. He and others of the family often
spoke in most kind and affectionate terms of an uncle of theirs
named James Turner. He seemed to be a great favorite of the
family. His son, James Turner, moved from North Carolina, at an
early date and settled in Tennessee on Duck River, which is now
in Murray County. My father visited that County after his removal
to Kentucky expressly to see his connections. After that visit I
often heard him speak of this James Turner, Joseph Morehead,
James Smith and James Sanford.</p>

            <li>Gustavus Morehead, first child of Turner and Ann
                Ransdell Morehead was born January 28<sup>th</sup>,
                1780. Joined the United States Army in 1802 as
                Lieutenant, Harris Hooe being captain of the
                Company to which he belonged. His company went to
                New Orleans in 1803 at the time Louisiana was
                taken possession of by the United States and
                afterwards was stationed at Fort St. Phillips,
                where he married a Miss Dunlass. Captain Hooe
                mentioned above was brother to my mother. He also
                died at Fort St. Phillips, never having married.</li>
            <li>Margaret Morehead was born September 28<sup>th</sup>
                1781 and was married to Charles M. Ransdell in

            <li>Nancy Morehead was born March 9<sup>th</sup>,
                1783 and was married to John Latham in Kentucky.
                (He was brother to the wife of Uncle Armistead
                Morehead). He died and left considerable family
                of children, some of them now living in
                Hopkinsville, Kentucky.</li>
            <li>Mary Morehead was born May 1<sup>st</sup>, 1784
                and was married to Wharton Ransdell in Kentucky
                where they resided many years. About the year of
                1823, they moved to Springfield, Illinois, where
                they both died.</li>
            <li>Turner Morehead, Second, was born May 8<sup>th</sup>,
                1785. He married a Miss Worthington of Baltimore
                County, Maryland. He resided for many years in
                Baltimore, engaged in mercantile business
                afterwards in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where
                he had several daughters and a son, Col. Turner
                G. Morehead. He also had two sons, Garrett W. and
                Thomas now living in Howard County, Missouri,
                both of whom have considerable family.</li>
            <li>Armistead Ransdell Morehead was born January 28<sup>th</sup>,
                1789. He was for a number of years a merchant in
                Bowling Green, Kentucky. He married Alzira Hewitt
                of Virginia.</li>
            <li>Sally Morehead was born January 11<sup>th</sup>,
                1791. She was married in Virginia to James Ellis,
                Fauquier County. He moved to Kentucky about 1818
                and settled in Warren County. I remember the
                names of but two of her children, Turner and
                Armistead, who moved to Mississippi.</li>
            <li>James Morehead was born January 4<sup>th</sup>,
                1793. He was married to Mary T. Donaldson at
                Bowling Green, Kentucky, where he engaged in
                mercantile pursuits for a number of years.
                Afterwards he removed to Christian County,
                Kentucky, and engaged in farming. I think he
                lived in that county in 1826 at the time I
                removed to Missouri. He left a widow with one or
                more children. She subsequently married Charles
                A. Smith. For this relative, I cherish a warm
                affection. I lived with her and my brother in
                early youth. She was both sister and mother to
                me.</li>
            <li>Henry Morehead was born August 8<sup>th</sup>,
                1795. He married a Miss Worthington of Baltimore
                County, Maryland, who died in Kentucky, leaving a
                daughter.</li>

<p align="center"><b>THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM A LETTER.</b></p>

<p>Mumfordville, Kentucky</p>

<p>17<sup>th</sup> July, 1910.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. C. R. Morehead,</p>

<p>El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>Dear Cousin:</p>

<p>In reading General Buckner&#146;s letters to him while at West
Point, in 1840, he says: &#145;If war comes I desire you to act
the soldier and emulate the example of your grandfather, Turner
Morehead, who was the first to mount the parapets in the storming
of Stoney Point under General Wayne.&#146;</p>

<p>Very truly,</p>

<p>Mrs. Delia C. Buckner.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>From the Louisville </b><b><i>Courier
Journal</i></b></p>

<p>The Louisville <i>Courier Journal</i>, of date December 11,
1911, in an article headed &quot;Past Mistresses of
Kentucky&#146;s Executive Mansion,&quot; states of Mrs. Delia
Claiborne Buckner, wife of General S. B. Buckner as follows:</p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>When Mrs. Buckner succeeded Mrs. Knott so gradual
                was the change in the affairs at the mansion that
                Governor Buckner often declared that he could not
                tell where Governor Knott&#146;s administration
                ended and his began.<p>Mrs. Delia Claiborne
                Buckner was the descendant of William Claiborne,
                who came to Virginia in 1619, as Surveyor General
                with Governor Yeardly. He was Secretary of the
                Colony for thirty years, Councilor, Treasurer for
                life and Acting Governor. She was also a
                grandniece of both General Washington and his
                wife. She was one of the most cultured and
                queenly women who ever occupied the exalted
                position of Mistress of the Mansion, the charm of
                her presence being almost irresistible.</p>
            </li>
        </dir>
    </li>

<p align="center"><b>THE HOOE FAMILY.</b></p>

<p>My mother, Mary Ann Hewitt Hooe, was the daughter of Harris
Hooe, Sr., of Stafford County, Virginia. She had four brothers
and two sisters, that I remember to have seen and known, or heard
her speak of: Harris, James, Robert, Francis and Martha. These I
have seen, except Harris, the other sister was older than herself
her name I do not remember. She married a lawyer Buchannan of
Falmouth, Virginia, and died before my recollection. A son of
hers, Dr. Wm. Buchannan lived in Falmouth when my father removed
to Kentucky.</p>

<ol>
    <li><ol>
            <li>Harris died unmarried.</li>
            <li>James Hooe married a Miss Hooe.</li>
            <li>Robert Hooe, lived on his father's old place,
                called &quot;Evergreen&quot; three miles from
                Falmouth, Virginia. His wife was a Fauntleroy.
                They had a large family. He died in Alexandria,
                Virginia.</li>
            <li>Francis died unmarried.</li>
            <li>Martha Hooe married Charles M. Ransdell of
                Kentucky. They both died in Bowling Green,
                Kentucky. They loft two sons, named Charles and
                Burnard.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The records of King George County, Virginia, show that Mary
Ann Hooe, the wife of Turner Morehead, was the daughter of Harris
Hooe and his wife Catherine Tallaferro. Harris Hooe was the son
of Hawson Hooe, who was the son of Rice Hooe. Rice Hooe was a
member of the House of Burgesses in the year of 1699, according
to the Virginia Historical Magazine of April, 1908.</p>

<p>The following is taken from William and Mary Magazine:</p>

<p>&quot;The first of the family in Virginia was Robert
Taliaferro, gentleman, who first resided in York County,
Virginia. He had a grant of land in Gloucester County, in 1655,
and in the document his name is written &#145;Toliver&#146;. * *
* &quot;</p>

<p>The following is the correspondence that passed between Mr.
Wythe and Mr. Jefferson on the origin of the family. Mr. Wythe
was interested in the matter because his wife at the time was
Elizabeth Taliaferro, daughter of Col. Richard Taliaferro of
James City County.</p>

<p>G. W. TO T. J.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to get the arms of Taliaferro, which, from
information, I believe to have been the Tuscan family, engraved
on a copper plate, with this motto: <font face="Symbol">O</font> <font
face="Symbol">U</font> <font face="Symbol">D</font> <font
face="Symbol">O</font> <font face="Symbol">K</font> <font

face="Symbol">A</font> <font face="Symbol">I</font> and the name
of Richard Taliaferro. But I would not have this done, if it can
not be without giving you trouble, nor unless you will order to
whom hero I shall repay the cost. Perhaps the motto taken from
Aeschylus (INSERT GREEK Upper and L) would be sufficient without
__________. If you think so, leave out that word. Adieu. 10 Jan.
1786. Williamsburgh.&quot;</p>

<p>T. J. TO W. G.</p>

<p>&quot;Immediately on receipt of your letter I wrote to a
correspondent at Florence to enquire after the family of
Taliaferro as you desired. I received his answer two days ago, a
copy of which I now enclose. The original shall be sent by some
other occasion. I will have the copper-plate immediately
engraved. This may be ready within a few days, but the
probability is that I shall be long in getting an opportunity of
sending it to you, as those rarely occur. You do not mention the
size of the plate, but presume it is intended for labels for the
inside of books, I shall have it made of proper size for that. I
shall omit the word according to the license you allow me,
because I think the beauty of a motto is, to condense such matter
in as few words as possible, the word omitted will be supplied by
every reader * * * . Paris, August 13, 1786.&quot;</p>

<p>Catherine A. Morehead, wife of Charles R. Morehead, Sr., died
on the nineteenth day of November, 1874. Charles R. Morehead,
Sr., died on the fifth day of November, 1880.</p>

<p>William Morehead joined Captain J. R. Hendlay&#146;s Company,
Ray County, Missouri Mounted Volunteers, July, 1846, at the age
of seventeen years.</p>

<p>In a letter written by Captain Hendlay to his father, C. R.
Morehead, dated Counsel Grove, Kansas, twenty-sixth of August,
1846 he states, &quot;William's horse stands the trip so far very
well. He takes great care of his horse. He is well and does his
duty like a man. I find the young men the most tractable and I
think they will make fine soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p>Captain Hendlay was killed at the battle of Moro, New Mexico.
His remains were brought back to Richmond by his Company and
buried there. William&#146;s horse was shot and killed at that
battle, which put him on foot for a time.</p>

<p>Later in a letter from Captain William Jacobs, who succeeded
Capt. Hendlay, dated Santa Fe, New Mexico, tenth of October,
1846, to C. R. Morehead, Sr., he states as follows: &quot;William
stands the trip and climate, first-rate. He has never missed a
single roll call and has had perfect health. All the time he has
done more service up to this date than any member of the Company.
He is always well and willing to do his duty.&quot;</p>

<p>William started to California in 1850 and together with Mr.
John Benson, who was a partner of his father in the mercantile
business in Lexington, Missouri, bought and started with a drove
of mules to California, which were at that time in great demand
in California. Mr. Benson, himself and others in the party took
the cholera and died at Fort Barnard near Fort Laramie, on the
fourth day of May, 1850.</p>

<p>The following is a letter written by the Past Grand Master of
the Grand Lodge of Kentucky F. &amp; A. M. to C. R. Morehead, Jr.
of El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>To C. R. Morehead, El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:- Yours of the fourth inst., duly received and in
reply will say that I have examined the records of the Bowling
Green Lodge No. 73, which was instituted in 1821 by Grand Master
Henry Clay, and find that C. R. Morehead was made a Mason in our
Lodge, January 11th, 1822. Also find that James Turner Morehead
was initiated in same Lodge in August, 1821. Do not know if this
is the Turner Morehead you refer to or not. In 1823 it appears
that James Turner Morehead was Master, Chas. R. was Secretary.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>(Signed) F. C. Gerard, Past Grand Master,</p>

<p>and Past M. Bowling Green Lodge No. 73.</p>

<p>P. S. -- Charles R. Morehead was a Royal Arch Mason.</p>

<p>Lemire Morris Morehead died on the twenty-fifth of June, 1910.
The following is an extract from the El Paso <i>Times</i> of
Tuesday, June 28, 1910:</p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>All of the El Paso banks closed at two o'clock
                yesterday afternoon out of respect for Mrs.
                Lemire Morris Morehead, whose funeral took place
                at Santa Monica, California, yesterday at that
                hour.<p>The deceased had many warm friends and
                admirers in El Paso who were deeply pained to
                read in the Times yesterday morning of the
                announcement of her death. She was a lovable
                woman.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Morehead&#146;s maiden name was Lemire
                Morris, She was born in Kentucky and was the
                daughter of one of that State&#146;s oldest and
                most cultured families. As a girl she was bright,
                pretty and charming. Brought up in the Baptist
                church, she was a consistent Christian member of
                that church throughout life.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1881, C. R. Morehead brought
                his young wife and their daughter, Ida, to El
                Paso. They came over the Santa Fe railroad as far
                as Rincon, from which point they made the rest of
                the trip to El Paso on the stage. At that time
                there were no desirable residence houses in El
                Paso for rent and the hotel accommodations wore
                very unsatisfactory so Mr. Morehead and Mrs.
                Morehead and their daughter, lived with Judge
                Joseph Magoffin&#146;s family for three years.
                During those three years a strong friendship grew
                up between Mrs. Magoffin and Mrs. Morehead and
                until the former died several years ago, they
                were as intimate as sisters. </p>
                <p>Mrs. Morehead was very fond of her friends and
                found her chief happiness in their happiness and
                prosperity. Her heart was filled with that
                Christian charity that can always find excuses
                for the weak and can find virtue where others can
                find only the bad. She was a devoted wife and a
                tender, loving mother, who was worshipped by her
                grandchildren, whose little hurts disappeared at
                her gentle touch or the sound of her tender
                voice.</p>
                <p>Like her husband, Mrs. Morehead found pleasure
                in doing great deal of charity work, which no one
                except herself, her husband and the beneficiary
                of her kindness knew anything about. While very
                fond of the company of her friends, Mrs. Morehead
                was inclined to eschew social gaieties preferring
                to spend her evenings at her home fire-side with
                her husband and occasionally three or four
                friends.&quot;</p>
                <p>Mrs. Lemire Morris Morehead came from the old
                New England family of Morrises, everal of whom
                were prominent patriots in the Revolutionary War.</p>
                <p>Her grandfather, David Morris, in his youth
                joined Captain Benjamin Lang&#146;s Company,
                First Regiment, Essex County, New Jersey, New
                Jersey Volunteers, and served through the war of
                Independence.</p>
                <p>Soon after the close of the war he married
                Mary Shotwell, and with her brother, John, who
                was also a Revolutionary soldier, and two other
                families, immigrated and settled in Mason County,
                Kentucky, in 1788. The party bought four sections
                of land cornering with each other, and built
                their houses near together, also built a block
                house for a rendezvous in case of attack by
                marauding bands of Indians that infected the
                country at that time.</p>
                <p>Her father, William V. Morris, at the age of
                twenty-one years joined Captain G. W. Boggs&#146;
                Company, Second Regiment, Kentucky Mounted
                Volunteers under Col. John Donaldson, which
                marched from Cincinnati on the first of
                September, 1813, for Canada, which country they
                entered at Detroit. He was appointed Regimental
                Quartermaster September 16th, 1813. He also
                served with the Kentucky Riflemen at the Battle
                of New Orleans, January 8th, 1815.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Morehead was a daughter of the Society of
                the American Revolution and a real daughter of
                the Society of the War of 1812.</p>

<p align="center"><b>TURNER FAMILY</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>(No. 239)</b></p>

<p>The Turner family of Virginia being allied to the Turners of
Massachusetts, that it is clearly evident the families are from
the same source in England, and therefore produce their arms, as
given by Burke, who says the family bearing these arms were of
&quot;Thorvoston,&quot; County Devon; Humphry Turner, Esq., of
Thorvoston was forty-six years old at the Visitation of the
Heralds in 1620, when arms were conferred. He was son of Anthony
Turner, and grandson of Anthony Turner, both of the same place.
Captain William Turner of Boston, Mass., who commanded an
expedition against the Indians in 1676, brought the arms over in
1673; he died bravely at the head of his men at the crossing of
the Green River during a bloody conflict. The arms as given by
Burke, are quarterly, as the Turners had allied with noble family
of Page of Blackheath, County Kent, and therefore partook of
their arms, but we here give only the arms of Turner proper;
being a shield sable, a chevroon ermine, between three fers de
moline, or: on a chief, arg. A lion passant, gules.</p>

<p>CREST -- A lion passant, gule, holding in the dexter paw a
laurel branch, vert. Motto., Esse Quam Viderie, (To be, not to
seem.)</p>

<p>From the Norther family was James Turner, one of the earliest
settlers in Maryland, and from him were the Turners of
Southhampton, Va., one of whom, also James, born December 20th,
1766, moved to North Carolina, about 1800 and became Governor of
the State. The wife of the first James Turner, of Maryland, Mrs.
Kerenhappuck Turner, was the noted heroine of the battle of
Guilford Courthouse, where she risked her life in ministering to
the wounded and dying of General Greene&#146;s army. From that
union were many of the bravest sons and daughters of North
Carolina. One of their daughters, Elizabeth Turner, married
Joseph Morehead of Virginia, who was the ancestor of Governor
John M. Morehead of North Carolina and his brother James Turner
Morehead was a Member of Congress from the same state. Another
daughter, Mary Turner, married a brother of Joseph, Charles
Morehead, whose descendants moved to Kentucky. James Turner
Morehead, a son of Armistead Morehead was Governor and later U.
S. Senator of Kentucky. His cousin, Charles S. Morehead, a son
Charles Morehead, was a Member of Congress and also Governor of
Kentucky. Another brother of Armistead and Charles, Colonel
Turner Morehead, a revolutionary hero, had a grandson, General S.
B. Buckner, who was Governor of Kentucky.</p>

<p>There were many Turners in Lower Counties of Virginia who bore
an active part in the councils of the colony and who served in
the militia. John Turner of Southhampton, was in the Indian wars,
1750; his son, William, of James City County, died in 1809,
leaving many brothers and sisters, among whom was Thomas and John
of Mathews County, 1791.</p>

<p>The family has also been well represented in the Church. The
Rev. Joseph Wilmar Turner, of Georgia, whose death has boon
recently announced, was born of the Virginia family, and
officiated with great acceptance in many Southern States. Also
the Rev. James H. Turner, who was born in Franklin County, 1841,
son of John and James [sic] (Wright) Turner, after serving with
Stuart gallantly during the Confederate War, entered the ministry
in the Lutherville, Md. Church, and is still serving the Church
at Lutherville, Md.</p>

<p>Among the many Turners of Richmond, was a Mr. David Turner,
from the North, who settled and operated a classical school
previous to the war. He was a most practical and entertaining
teacher, not only to his pupils, but to many of his friends and
patrons, by giving them entertaining lectures on chemistry,
philosophy and other sciences. His pupils were among some of the
most prominent citizens of the present day who owe their talents
to the genius of &quot;Old David Turner&quot; in his little
school on Main Street, but the Civil War drove the good old
pedagogue back to his people in the North, though he took a
Virginia girl as a wife with him.</p>

<p>The Turners intermarried with the Ashbys, Taylors, Wilmers,
Austins, Bookers, Armistead, and many others, whose names have
boon preserved in deeds of great worth.</p>

<p>May 5th, 1859.</p>

<p>James Turner married Miss Keren-Happuch Norman, and from them
our family relations had their origin. I have a recollection of
my great-grandmother Keren-Happuch Turner who died in North
Carolina at the advanced age of 115 years. James and
Keren-Happuch Turner had as I remember, one son and four
daughters, namely: James, Sarah, Mary, Elizabeth and Susan.</p>

<p>Two of the above daughters married two brothers, Charles and
Joseph Morehead. Joseph Morehead married Elizabeth Turner and
removed from Fauquier County, Virginia to Halifax County,
Virginia. His descendants moved from Virginia to North Carolina,
and I have a recollection of seeing him in his lifetime. Charles
Morehead, who married Mary Turner remained in Virginia. His
descendants moved to Kentucky in 1807.</p>
