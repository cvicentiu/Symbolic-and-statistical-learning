<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Some of the old history given and taken from old Bibles
of long ago concerning the Old Plantation of Daniel Payne, back in
1798, when he came to Monroe County, Kentucky, and homesteaded on Hackenbranch.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>He occupied some 200 acres of land and became a slave
holder for some 30 years. He also became holder of other land in this community,
one tract of which the Payne Cemetery is located. He gave the ground for
a graveyard and the remainder to his son James Payne. Daniel Payne was
married to a daughter of Elihu Fraizer in 1803, to this union was born
13 children. He retired from slave holdings, and gave his negros to his
son Daniel Thomason Payne, Jr. except one negro girl he gave to his son
John Payne in 1840 as a gift as a wedding present. His father died in 1845.
His plantation fell to his son Daniel Thomason Payne, Jr.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In later years he and N. T. Stoffman built a water mill
for grinding corn, run by water that came out of a large spring that came
out of the foothills of the plantation. A very large spring, the water
was channeled into a fobay which was kept to run through the mill on a
waterwheel for power. In later years the mill fell into the hands of H.
K. Payne, later was sold to Uncle Tom Rich. He ran the mill by token toll,
one gallon of corn for every bushel of corn he ground finely. Uncle Tom
got so feeble he could no longer take care of the trade, so he gave it
over to his son-in-law Bud Davis, who ran it for a few short years and
closed the mill and quit. No mill there any more, just the old spring,
still running the same.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The old house that stood up on the hill of the plantation
is gone, almost forgotten. It was a two story house built of logs, four
rooms with a large stone chimney. The house was chinked and daubed with
(???) for years. Later it was weather-boarded and re-covered. Some years
later it was built on to by Hezzie Payne.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>H. K. Payne's grandfather was a slave holder and many
slaves died in his day. He had a graveyard on the plantation which he kept
fenced till he died and then after that it was respected by his children
and kept up until H. K. Payne died.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Since there is no house of graveyard there anymore, I
have an old picture of the old plantation (Picture at the bottom of the
page) taken 50 years ago which will give you a little idea of what it looked
like. Given to you for remembrance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The darky girl given to John Payne was cared for and respected
until death. She married to a man and many called him Peden, who belonged
to Uncle Thompson Peden, a slave holder, but she did not want to be called
Peden so they called her Mary Ann Payne. She always said she wanted to
live with Maw Payne, and did til she died. She raised 3 children, Bell,
Jane and Henry. Henry went away for a few years when grown, but came back
and wanted to make his home there again, so Julie E. Payne prepared a cabin
for him, he lived there until death. Bell, the oldest girl married Wolford
Gentry, a cook by trade, a noted cook throughout the country. Jane, the
second girl lived with her sister Bell, so when Bell and Wolford died she
was left homeless. through mercy Elizabeth Biggers, a daughter of Julie
E. Payne, took care and had a home for Jane and later Elizabeth Biggers
died and Jane was left alone. So Dr. Lonie C. Biggers a son of hers Elizabeth
Biggers took Jane and cared for her till her days were ended. Those darkies
were taken and cared for by the white kin folks of the Payne generation.
Always respected by the communities of the neighborhood where theylived.
The darkies always knew their place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As it seems that many of Daniels children migrated to
Sullivan Co., Mo about 1850 or a little after.  There was a Payne

He was a well-to-do man, and owned about 330 acres of land at the time
of his decease. His wife, Sarah Norman Payne was born in North Carolina,
in 1811, and of German and Iish descent. She was brought to Monroe Co.,

educated in a log-cabin school house, and lived with his parents until
over twenty years of age. In 1850 he was united in marriage to Miss America
V. Bradburn, who was born in Simpson Co., Ky, in 1834, and was a daughter
of William Bradburn. Of this union there are two living children: Reuben

left his native State, and immigrated to Sullivan Co., Mo, locating upon
the farm now owned by S. McCullough, which he rented one year. The following

From Goodspeed <B><I>History of Sullivan Co., Mo</I></B>. <BR>
Caleb Payne is a native of Monroe Co., Ky, was born in 1844, and is a son
of Reuben and Sarha Norman Payne. Caleb was the ninth child of a family
of twelve (funny in Addison Goodspeed says that there were only 8 children
of Reuben and Sarah Norman Payne)., and received but a limited education
at the common schools of the vicinity in which he lived. He was but eleven
years of age at the death of his father, and when fourteen left his native
State, and came to Sullivan co. with his brother John Payne, now a resident
of Madison, Neb. After arriving at Missouri he spent a year farming and
attending school, and clerked eighteen months for Lane & McClauahan.
In the spring of 1862 he went to Denver city, Colo. with a herd of cattle,
the journey occupying the time between May 10 and august. He remained West
three years engaged in stock dealing and mining. In 1865 he returned to
nebraska City, Beb, and in 1866 to Milan, Mo. and the following year returned
to his birthplace, where he spent one year. In 1868 he again came to Milan,
and in 1869 went to Kentucky returning with his siter. In 1870 he traded
in cattle at St. Louis, and the following year established a livery stable,
in which he was interested until 1874. during that year he engaged in business
in Scottsville, and in the fall was united in marriage to Miss Martha E.
Lane, daughter of Thomas Lane, a pioneer settler of Sullivan Co. Mrs. payne
was born in Sullivan Co., in 1853, and is the mother of three children:
Norman, Nova and Harry C. In the fall of 1875 he returned to Sullivan Co.,
and pruchased a farm of 120 acres, upon which he farmed and speculated
in stock, hogs and cattle. In 1878 he was elected as collector of Sullivan
co., to which office he was re elected in 1880, but in 1881 was deprived
of his office by the law of township organization coming into effect. Since
1881 he has dealt in horses, real estate and paper, and is one of the substantial
men of the town owning three business house in Milan, two dwelling houses
and 250 acres of land. He is one of the oldest business men in Milan, and
greatly interested in all laudable public enterprises. May 12, 1887, he
lost about $1500 by fire, but is now erecting a brick two story business
house 20 x 80 feet, adjoining the one burned by fire, giving him two substantial
buildings in the block. In politics he is a Democrate and in Masonry a
mmber of the Chapter.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Notes for Ezekiel JONES: <BR>
The following is the Preface to the book by <B><A HREF="daniel.htm#Marian Lucille6">Dr.
Lucille Dillenger Alexander</A></B> on the Jones and Payne families of
Sullivan Co., Mo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>My Grandmother was born Amanda Augusta Jones; her father
was John Harvey Jones; his father was Ezekiel Jones, and that's as far
as we go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Because Jones is such a common name, it is difficult to
research. Ezekiel was born in Tennessee in 1814 and apparently moved to
Monroe County, Kentucky about 1820. (Land bought before 1820 would be listed
in Barren Co., KY). There was many Jones families in Tennessee and many
in Monroe Co, Ky, but it seems impossible to be sure which is his family.
Ezekiel's wife, Nancy Payne, was the daughter of Daniel Payne. I have concentrated
mostly on Sullivan Co., TN and Washington Co., TN, as those were the TN
counties that Nancy's family was apparently in. In the Monroe Co., census,
Daniel and his sons appear. Also Wm. Braden, Nancy's first husband appears
in 1830. There were several Jones families near Daniel Payne and his sons
and near William Braden. Nancy and Ezekiel were apparently married about
1836. It is usually the neighboring families who provide the spouses. Also
it is sometimes fruitful to search the childrens's names. Children of Ezekiel
and Nancy were John Harvey Jones, Sanford Payne Jones, Martha Ellendar
Jones, and James King (or Knox) Polk Jones. Sanford Payne Jones returned
to Ky.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Dear Joe,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Was great to hear from you so promptly. I would like to
exchange information about the Dale family. My direct ancestors are Anderson's,
Their ancestors are of the Dale's we had talked of. Actually my Great great
grandfather Payton Anderson was married to Elizabeth Jane (Montgomery)
both of them were decendants of Dale. I believe the connection to be brothers
in both lines.Reuben Dale b:5/14/1797 & Sarah(Gill) had at least five
children that I have found, two of them married Anderson's in Barren County,
Ky. Most of my family moved from Barren Cty, Ky to Missouri. If you send
the GEDCOM file, could you please make sure that it is compressed, I've
had problems with a bunch of gargled info recieved, from non-compressed
files. By the way, just curious, but</FONT></P>

There are three things in that entry I should comment on. first, Elijah
is beginning to draw maps. This may not be the first mntion he has mde
of his map drawing, but it is near the first. Heretofore he has chiefly
been reading and occassionally doing some "ciphering." Second,
Steve is trading mules and horses now, He is getting a reputation as a
trader of mules and horses, especially mules. And third, Sister E. R. Payne
is Elijah's sister, Elizabeth Frazier. She married Enoch Payne after the
death of her husband, John Frazier.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="Notes for Harmon B."></A><B>Notes for Harmon B. PAYNE:</B> From
Goodspeed <B><I>History of Sullivan Co., Mo</I></B>. Harmon B. Payne was
born in Monroe Co., Ky, in 1849, and is a son of Enoch and Nancy Frazier
Payne. the father was born in Monroe Co., Ky, in 1822, and is a son of
Daniel Payne and Martha Frazier Payne, who were natives of Virginia and
Tennessee, born in 1780 and 1783, and died in 1858 and 1849, respectively.
They moved to Monroe Co., Ky in 1818. Enoch was married in 1844, and located
in Monroe Co, where he lived until 1883, with the exception of nineteen
years spent in Barren Co., Ky. In 1883 he came to Sullivan Co., Mo., and
bought 148 acres of land in Polk Township where he resided six terms of
school life engaged in farming, which occupation he has since followed,
with the exception of a year spent in merchandising in Barren Co., at Nobob.
He is a Democrate, and while in Barren Co., served as justice of the peace
for four years. Himself and wife are members of the Christian Chruch. Mrs
Payne (the mother of Harmon B.) was born in 1826, in Monroe Co., Ky, and
is the mother of twelve children, ten of whom are living: Mary Jane, John
P., Harmon B., Letha E., Martha E. Jesse T., George W., Joseph H. Nannie
B. and Isphenia E. Harmon B., our subject was educated at the district
schools of his native country and lived with his parents, making himself
useful upon the farm until twenty years of age. After leaving the parental
roof he went to Cass Co., Mo, where he resided one year. In 1870 he came
to Sullivan Co., Mo., and August 22, 1872, married Miss Isphenia, daughter
of Samuel Page. This lady was born in Monroe Co., Ky., in 1854, and has
boorne five children: thomas, Nannie, Ida, Lulu,a and Frank. In 1876, Mr.
Payne bought twenty acres of land, where he has since resided. To his original
purchase he has constantly added land, until he now owns 192 acres, all
the result of his won industry and good management. In politics he is a
Democrat, and cast his first presidential vote for H. Greeley in 1872.
He is a Mason of the Royal Arch Degree, and for the past eighteen months
has been clerk of the Christian chruch, of which himself and wife are members.<BR>
