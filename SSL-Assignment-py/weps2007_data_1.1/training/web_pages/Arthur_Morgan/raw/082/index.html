clear line of demarcation between legend and tradition, history, and the 
spiritual facts of occult research. They must be interwoven. Legends are often 
the imaginative pictures of fundamental truths. The conclusion is not to be

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Out of the grave of silence and obscurity, Rudolf 
Steiner, with his incomparable seership, called to life again the Holy Mysteries 
of ancient times. He gave out the results of his investigations in various 
lectures over a period of many years; but in the month or two immediately 
preceding the reconstitution of the Anthroposophical Society at Christmas, 1923, 
he delivered a course of lectures which embodied a marvellous synthesis of all 
the Mysteries as an introduction to the subsequent ‘Foundation Course.’ The 
Foundation of the reconstituted Anthroposophical Society stood for a re-birth of 
the ancient Mysteries in a new form as the background of the true spiritual life 
of the modern age—as the background for a renewed Christ-experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</b>In these lectures of November and December, 1923, he led his hearers through 
the ancient Mysteries of Hibernia, through the Greek Mysteries of Ephesus, of 
Samothrace, of Eleusis, to the dawn of the Mysteries of the Rose-Cross in the 
Middle Ages. It was not until later, in the summer of 1924, that he, in a 
measure, completed this background by his description of that beautiful 
outgrowth from the Hibernian Mysteries, the Order of the Knights of King Arthur 
and the Round Table, and its subsequent union with the spiritual stream of the 
Holy Grail. These last lectures were given in London after the Torquay Summer 
School and Dr. Steiner’s visit to Tintagel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This article will be an attempt to outline the spiritual-historical setting of 
the Round Table, drawing the material from the above-mentioned lectures and from 
legends and traditions which receive a new significance in the light of 
Spiritual Science.</p>

<span style="font-style: normal">The Cosmic Background</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>We must approach the subject from two sides. First from 
the side of its cosmic significance, trying to realise its evolution from out of 
the spiritual foundations of earthly genesis; and on the other hand from the 
light we can obtain through legends </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>and fragments of history.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The Mysteries of King Arthur are the oldest of the European Mysteries, and their 
origin reveals why they&nbsp; are so significant in helping us to understand the 
present and the future in connection with the spiritual life of the West. To 
begin with we must </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>turn our gaze to a remote period when the continent of 
Atlantis existed. Today it is no longer necessary to make any apology for 
mentioning Atlantis; it is sufficiently well established as a fact of history or 
geography, apart from occult Investigations.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was during the existence of Atlantis that man first 
began to be similar in bodily structure to what he is today, though with a 
consciousness utterly different,&nbsp; and still partly wrapped in fluctuating 
clairvoyant vision. The earth had not yet become wholly </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">hardened in its mineral forms. It was a world mingled with 
mists and rainbows for physical sight, still in a kind of radiance from its 
birth out of the cosmic interpenetration of Sun and Moon. Human bodies kept pace 
in their development with the development of the Earth, and were also not yet 
quite hardened as regards theskeleton. One must imagine that earth and man were 
in a kind of threefold condition, ‘growing’ into their fully materialised form. 
Out of the past they were moulded and </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">influenced by the forces still remaining in the earth from 
its earlier states, known in Occult Science as ‘Saturn,’ ‘Sun,’ and ‘Moon’ 
states. Secondly there was the contemporary result of these three combined with 
the forces proceeding from the </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">now&nbsp; externalised Sun and Moon bodies; and thirdly there 
were the influences pouring constructively into the Earth-substance from the 
different planets.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All that had gone before was spiritual; it was the 
spiritual Progenitor of this growing Earth. Man looked up to this as to a 
Father—to the highest conceivable spiritual condition of earth-evolution, the <i>
Saturn</i> state. On the other hand, the Atlantean was faced on earth by the 
Mysteries of incarnation. Out of spirit, matter Was there as the ‘fixation of 
the volatile.’ His own being, born out of the Father-Spirit, had to find its way 
into a body which was itself the materialised expression of </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the Saturn force, and which was subject to death. In other 
words, the great Mystery confronting that ancient humanity was precisely the 
Mystery of the ‘Heights’ and ‘Depths’—<i>Incarnation</i>. The Heights and 
Depths—life and death—in their total</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">circumference, represented the Father, or the ‘Great 
Spirit.’ No modern man can have the slightest idea of the stupendous content of 
that primeval awareness of spiritual immanence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It may sound strange in our ears, but it is true to say 
that the great Initiate-Leaders of these people were able to guide the 
incarnating human spirits in the right way into the physical bodies. We cannot 
with our own limited materialistic</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">thinking, understand the possibility of such a thing; but 
this ‘guiding into incarnation’ was connected with the fact that the forces of 
the future were active out of planetary spheres (in cooperation with the Earth) 
in creating a differentiation of that which was at first a more or less 
homogeneous humanity into the several <i>races</i> which subsequently wandered 
from Atlantis over the world. This fact lay at the basis of the existence later 
of Mystery cults connected with the planetary Gods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the central Mystery cult, namely that of the Sun, was 
universally developed during and after the destruction of Atlantis, and became 
the guiding influence of progressive civilisations, beginning with that of 
ancient Persia. It is necessary to realise that for this primeval human 
consciousness, the Sun—the &nbsp;Spiritual Sun-Beings or the ‘Elohim’—helped in 
establishing all knowledge of the external Universe; one may indeed call if <i>
‘Science’</i>;--while the Spiritual Moon-Beings (led by Jehovah) gave the wisdom 
of the soul, the inner pictures of pure Heavenly imaginations, free from earthly 
passions—the foundations of <i>‘Art.’<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">[1]
</font></span><![endif]></span></i>The Earth itself, and the earthly beings, 
ripened the material substances and Forces in which these cosmic Artists worked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since the Earth was there for the purpose of the 
development of the Human Hierarchy, the Sun, the source of earthly life, was the 
heart of all the Mystery Schools. From the earliest ages the Divine Leader of 
the Sun-Beings was known to the Initiates as the Christ. He was called by many 
Names—Vishvakarman, Ahura-Mazdao, Osiris, Apollo. It was known that this Being 
would leave the Sun and descend to the Earth. As the time drew nearer for the 
Incarnation of Christ, so the knowledge concerning the ultimate all-embracing 
Mysteries of the ‘Father,’ known to the Atlantean Initiates, gradually receded 
and grew dim. Until, at the time when the very earliest <i>Arthur Mysterie</i>s 
can be spoken of—several centuries B.C.—this &nbsp;knowledge, outcome of the last 
remnants of Atlantean wisdom which had remained behind in Ireland, or 
‘Hibernia,’ had sunk, so to speak, to realms of Earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The polarities of the heights and Depths of the Father-God 
were then recognized, not in cosmic infinitudes, but in the <i>world of the 
Elements,</i> where Sun and Earth, in the polarities of Fire and Air, Water and 
Earth, were seen clairvoyantly as spiritual </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">beings and forces in living interaction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This gives the foundation for a wonderful spiritual 
Nature-Science embodied In the Druid and Arthur Mysteries in the centuries 
before and immediately after Christ. And far more than this. For this ‘Nature 
Science’—interplay of ‘Heaven’ and</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Earth’—which had sprung from the deep foundations of the 
Mysteries of incarnation as known to the Atlanteans in the sacred ‘West,’ 
revealed that the lower pole, or ‘Depths,’ brings death to the physical; but 
that in the knowledge of the destructive forces lies also the knowledge of <i>
healing</i>. Creation and destruction and healing—these were the three parts of 
the secrets of the Mysteries. The healing art originated from them. It came from 
the sacred West. Rudolf Steiner indicates that</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anthroposophical Medicine arises out of a knowledge of the 
‘Saturn’ or Father Mysteries,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">[2]</font></span><![endif]></span> 
the <i>spiritual </i>basis of the <i>physical</i> organisation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To complete our cosmic background to King Arthur, we must 
add one other Planet. The Initiates, who could foresee the gradual drawing 
together of the divine and the earthly, the approach of the Christ-Being—and in 
this drawing together</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the increasing invisibility of the divine—wished to guard 
humanity from all that could still rise out of the depths—Evil. Hence it must 
come about that in preparing for later eras of civilisation, endeavours must be 
made to guard the <i>rights</i> of man, who</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">was a spiritual being. These ‘rights’ should be 
guarded—not, to begin with, out of love or charity in the Christian sense, but 
as upholding man’s kingly inner splendour in the face of the powers of 
destruction. With King Arthur we have to connect not</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">only the spiritual science of Nature, but the earliest 
inauguration of the life of&nbsp; rights—the birth of chivalry. The organisation 
of the life of rights had its actual origin in the British Mysteries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">King Arthur was not a single individual. It was a name 
denoting a leader in These Mysteries; but that is not to say that such a leader 
could not also be a ‘King’ in the ordinary sense. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rudolf Steiner speaks especially of an ‘earlier’ King 
Arthur&nbsp; <span style="font-family: ire">than the so-called historical Arthur of 
the sixth century A.D.&nbsp; But we find King Arthur’s name everywhere, and allusions 
to him as being ‘Emperor of the World.’ This is to be taken in the </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">sense of the ‘Order.’ In the 
same way we find mention of many Gueneveres, his Queen. But any study of King 
Arthur must clearly distinguish between the pre-Christian and post-Christian 
conditions of life and consciousness. Before the Mystery of Golgotha quite other 
conditions ruled in the super-sensible worlds. This difference is the source of 
all the confusion that arises when investigations are carried our purely in an 
external way. Similarly, the Grail Mysteries are confused with the Arthur</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Mysteries. The Grail stream 
of spiritual activity was something entirely different, coming from a different 
source, and the two streams met together in the seventh century. This will be 
dealt with later.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Of the older literature that 
deals with Arthur, the more important documents are Nennius’ </span><i>
<span style="font-family: ire">History of the Britons</span></i><span style="font-family: ire"> 
(ninth century); Sir Thomas Malory’s <i>Mort d’Arthur</i>; and the famous <i>
Books </i></span><i><span style="font-family: ire">of Wales. </span></i>
<span style="font-family: ire">A contemporary historian, Gildas, has no mention 
of King Arthur. He is said to have thrown into the sea, out of spite, a book 
about King Arthur written by Giraldus Cambrensis. It is curious how often in 
ancient tradition things that are precious are thrown or fall into the sea; but 
such sayings have a deep meaning for the occultist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">We can now turn our 
attention—with a brief return to Atlantis—to some of the traditions and legends, 
and the ‘properties’ of this wonderful drama.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal">“The old fairy tales, which are expressions of 
the ancient spiritual secrets of the world, have </span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">arisen because those who

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">spiritual secrets. Therefore 
their construction and composition are in accordance with these secrets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Hence we can say that within 
them dwells the spirit of the whole of humanity, of the microcosm</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">and of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">A special characteristic 
that meets us everywhere is the belief that Arthur did not die, but is sleeping, 
in some cave or mountain side or in the ‘island valley of Avillion,’ and that he 
will assuredly come again to be King of the West. This is a not unusual feature 
in many mythologies all over the world. But in the case of Arthur it seems to 
have taken a strange hold of popular fancy. Indeed the more one enters into the 
spirit of the legends, the more one feels in them a quality of</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">conviction. They <i>live</i>; 
and Arthur lives. With a wonderful artistic fitness, there can slip into our</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">narrative here a story from 
Plutarch:--</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">One Demetrius was sent by 
the Roman Emperor to explore the British Isles, and in his report of them he 
says: “Moreover there is an island there in which Cronos (Saturn) is improsoned, 
with Briareus keeping guard while he sleeps. Sleep, they say, is the bond forged 
for Cronos.” . . . This is nothing else than the hidden Cosmic Mysteries of the 
‘Heights’ and ‘Depths’ mentioned above, which are indeed only sleeping, and from 
which the Hibernian and Arthur Mysteries were derived.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[3]</font><![endif]></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">The name ‘Arthur’ has been 
the centre of endless discussion. It is said to be derived from </span><i>
<span style="font-family: ire">Arth-Uthyr,</span></i><span style="font-family: ire"> 
the Great Bear; and many sayings link Arthur with the sacred North. We feel a 
spiritual reality concealed here, and can find its deep connections with cosmic 
Mysteries in the following way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Every great period of 
civilisation is connected with the currents of the magnetism of the Earth. In 
Atlantis these currents flowed in a North-South direction. Speaking in the sense 
of occultism, this North-South influence is connected with the forces that built 
the human body. Without going into this question we can say with truth, that, as 
in the ancient spiritual consciousness </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">the ‘North’ was the birth 
place of <i>Time</i> (or Saturn) and was the source of <i>Light</i>, so the 
human head is the ‘North’ of the body; it is born first into the physical world 
and into time out of the womb; it is the place of Intelligence, or ‘Light.’ From 
this ‘North’ streams the spiritual substance of the bodily nature, which is then 
filled with the activity of the earthly forces. On the other hand the South (and 
this was so also in certain states of historical evolution in wars and 
conflicts), played its part in the</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">slow upbuilding of man, but 
as the source of all darkness and opposition. The ‘South’ of the human body is 
all that is carried in the blood (not the blood itself) as passions and purely 
bodily impulses—the mythical ‘Dragon.’ The Great Bear with its seven stars is 
the Watcher of the North, and the guardian of the secrets of Cronos. And such a 
picture as that of the sleeping Cronos conceals the reality of the ‘sleeping’ 
cosmic Mysteries of the beginnings of Earth evolution, the knowledge of&nbsp; 
which had to be lost to humanity for a time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">One of the most beautiful 
and the truest of all the legends is exquisitely told in Fiona Macleod’s <i>
Beyond the Blue Septentrions.</i> The boy Arthur, dreaming on the hills at 
twilight, watching the stars “climb out of shadowy abysses,” saw in vision the 
splendid figure of his father Pendragon (the Dragon’s Head) who pointed to the 
constellation of the Bear as the place to which he must soon return. Arthur, 
closing his eyes, felt himself “ascend the invisible stairways of the sky” until 
he stood on the verge of Arth-Uthyr, the Great Bear. There he saw with spiritual 
sight—the ‘Light of the North’—a company of majestic figures seated at a 
circular abyss of darkness. Each of the seven lordly Kings wore a star upon his 
forehead, and these were the stars of that great constellation. Among them all 
he recognised himself as King of the seven Kings. And then a voice that “rose 
and </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">fell through the eternal 
silences,” like a mighty ocean, proclaimed: “Comrades in God, the time has come 
when that which is great shall become small.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[4]</font><![endif]></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Is there any artistry of 
word or colour that could so delicately portray the tremendous truth that 
earthly events are indeed the ‘small writing’ of the starry heavens! <i>Seven</i> 
was the number of the first Round Table; <i>five</i> were added later. In these 
numbers students of Spiritual Science will find a hint of the great truths of 
pre-Christian and post-Christian Mysteries.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[5]</font><![endif]></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">Fiona Macleod also mentions 
a modern Slavonic ballad (based on the ancient tradition):--</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Among the Carpathian Highlands is a nameless ancient tomb lost in a pine 
forest, where at</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
mid-winter a bear has been seen to rise, walking erect like a man, crowned with 
a crown of iron and </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
gold, holding a single shining stone magnificent as the Pole Star, and crying in 
a deep voice: <i>I am</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Arthur of the West, who yet shall be King of the World.”</span></i></p>
<h3 style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">
<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">Again, Persian mythology shows 
the Peri Morgiana, or Morgana, who is identical with the
<span style="font-family: ire">Fairy Sister of King Arthur, Morgan le Fay, to 
have been rescued from the Mountains of Kaph and Taken to the ‘new Europe’—<i>i.e.</i> 
after the destruction of Atlantis—by Tahmurath. The Mountains of&nbsp; Kaph 
were, to the Persians, the mythical boundary of the world in the farthest North 
of arctic regions.</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">We have only touched lightly 
on this question of the name Arthur. There are of course many other sources of 
the name put forward by different investigators; but what has been said should 
help to arouse the feeling that a <i>true</i> ‘name’ is in reality a ‘spiritual 
calling.’ Bearing this in mind it is equally relevant to state that Arthur, as a 
deity, namely the god <i>Artaius</i>, or Mercury, took the place of the Welsh 
Gwydion, who represented <i>Science</i> and <i>Light.</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">The tradition of the Round 
Table with its twelve or twenty-four seats denotes that the Arthurian Mystery, 
grown out of its primeval Atlantean origin, was a solar cult. King Arthur in the 
midst of his twelve was the Sun, Guenevere the Moon. A legend tells that the 
Round Table was a wedding gift to King Arthur from his father Pendragon. In 
Wales, this name is synonymous with Pluto, the King of Hades, or the ‘Depths.’ 
The Table is at the same time the heavenly Zodiac and an Earthly centre from 
which the Mysteries flowed out. When the twelve <i>eat</i> at the Round Table

Man only becomes really ‘man’ by eating the fruits of the Earth. Eating is a 
transformation of earthly substances into spiritual forces. Christ changed the 
character of this ‘eating’ when He ate with His Twelve and gave them the new 
message to ‘love one another’ as brothers. Eating has always been an important 
part of all the Mysteries; and in the Arthurian legends we read that it was 
during the meals that the inspirations were brought to the Knights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Of the twelve seats (with their pairs) five would be representative of the 
constellations below the Earth, those of the Southern starry hemisphere, the 
so-called ‘dark’ signs; and there was always one empty seat, called the ‘Siege 
Perilous’ in which no man could sit without harm unless he was absolutely pure. 
In the post-Christian Arthurian tradition this seat was said to be symbolical of 
that of Judas, who had “gone out into the night.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Excalibur<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire; font-weight: 700">We can 
turn our attention from this central object of the Arthurian Mysteries to 
another one which holds a place of great importance, King Arthur’s sword, 
Excalibur. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Innumerable legends are woven around its origin; and allowing for variations 
here and there, we can allow our gaze to fall upon the picture of the great 
stone, white like fine marble, floating down upon the stream of Camelot, in 
which Merlin the Magician had embedded Excalibur, and from which it was drawn by 
King Arthur. Many strange things are said of this sword—that it was forged by 
the Lady of the Lake, that it had a peculiar tendency to return to the waters of 
Avalon whence it had come, that King Arthur might not always use it, but only 
when he was in great danger; that it shone with the light of thirty torches; 
that once a sham Excalibur had been made for Arthur by his sister Morgan le Fay. 
What is the meaning of Excalibur?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
A legend shows us the direction in which we should go to discover its 
meaning:--On one occasion Merlin placed the sword in its white stone in the 
lake, and left the scabbard on the mainland. There he built a perilous bridge of 
iron and steel only six inches wide, which had to be crossed between scabbard 
and sword. This is nothing else than the <i>drawing forth of the fire of the 
Word </i>of Inspiration and Intuition. The Word is uttered through the occult 
media of ‘Fire’ and ‘Water’—the spirit and the soul. To attain the power of the 
Word the bridge of blood and nerves—likened to iron and steel—has to be crossed; 
in other words, the forces in the body which are subject to death, in the 
physical and moral sense, must be overcome. The Father-force—that out of which 
man is born—bears also that opposite pole of man’s being which is destructive; 
but this same force in its aspect of ‘life,’ is able to exist apart from the 
scabbard of the body, and can be drawn from the <i>transmuted</i> forces of 
death, the ‘white stone,’ as the creative wisdom of the spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
The White Stone is the ‘philosopher’s stone’ of alchemy. Its whiteness, seen in 
the spirit, is the translucent light of the etheric world where the drawn sword 
of wisdom ‘flashes like the light of thirty torches.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Rudolf Steiner has said that the Knights of King Arthur could be called ‘Knights 
of the Sword,’ but the Knights of the Holy Grail ‘Knights of the <i>Word.’ </i>
We shall be able to grasp later in what this difference really consisted. In the 
Excalibur legends we find that sword and Word have, as it were, been welded into 
one through the deep meanings woven into this mysterious weapon from various 
sources. A wonderful truth is expressed in the old sayings that such a sword 
must be returned to its fountain—or lake—to be renewed. Dr. Steiner says that no 
one can obtain a <i>complete</i> picture of these Mysteries without a return to 
their spiritual source of inspiration. Without this, the Word, or Sword, remains 
broken.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Before we leave this brief outline of the mythical attributes of the Arthurian 
cult and turn to the deeper aspects, a word must be said about King Arthur’s 
sister Morgan le Fay.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
The Fairy Morgan (in Welsh tales ‘Mary Morgan’) can be either good or bad. She 
is to be found under various aspects all over the world and wherever she is she 
creates a beautiful and glamorous fairyland. Some legends represent her living 
in lakes or streams and luring people into the water. In truth, she is a great 
Enchantress—for she is that part of the human soul that creates deception out of 
the pictures of Imagination. She is it who both creates the fairy palaces and 
lures the human being to live in the illusion. She can be the good or evil 
genius of legend and fairy-tale, concealing (while also dwelling in) the true 
source of their inspiration. As represented in the half-actual and 
half-legendary accounts of that last great battle ‘among the mountains by the 
winter sea,’ she was the cause, through her illegitimate son Sir Modred, of King 
Arthur’s downfall. But afterwards, strangely enough, we find her associated with 
the guarding of King Arthur in the Earth, till he shall return again to rule; 
and this we shall have to mention once more towards the close in another 
connection.</span></p>

What we may specifically call the ‘Arthur Mysteries’ arose, says Rudolf Steiner, 
a ‘few thousand years ago’; and the places chosen for the cultivation of these 
Mysteries were places where the elemental forces of Nature could best be 
experienced in all their grandeur. Out of these experiences arose the impulses 
to heal mankind from the effects of their wild passions; while at the same time 
Nature herself disclosed her secrets of physical healing. Dr. Steiner says:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
“Up to the time of the Mystery of Golgotha, Christ had been a Sun-Being, 
belonging to the Sun. Before the Mystery of Golgotha took place, the Knights of 
King Arthur’s Round Table from this castle on the rocks (Tintagel) looked out 
upon the play of the Sun-born Spirits with the Earth-born Spirits, and felt that 
what lived in this play of the Nature-beings, entered their hearts, and 
especially their etheric bodies. With it they drank in the Christ-Impulse, which 
was then streaming out from the Sun, and they lived in the influences of this 
Sun-stream.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
“Thus, before the Mystery of Golgotha, the Knights of King Arthur, seated at 
their Round Table, received into their hearts the Sun-Spirit, the pre-Christian 
Christ. They then sent messengers out into all Europe to subdue the fierceness 
of the astral bodies of the European populations, to purify and civilise them, 
for this was their mission. We see such men as these Knights of King Arthur’s 
Round Table, starting here from this Western England, to carry out to the whole 
humanity of Europe . . . what they had received from the Sun, to purify and 
refine the astral nature of those fierce Europeans—particularly fierce in 
central and Northern Europe. Then came the Mystery of Golgotha.” . . .</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Some centuries after the Mystery of Golgotha we find the indications of a great 
change. Turning again to what we can read in the different legends of the 
historical Arthur, we cannot but be impressed by the shadow of melancholy that 
begins to fall upon the Round Table after the first tidings of the Holy Grail 
have been brought to King Arthur’s court. It is through Parsifal, of whom Dr. 
Steiner says he was a ‘modern’ man filled with a concious striving and 
individual aspiration unknown to the men of his time, that the Grail quest 
becomes united with the Round Table Fellowship. Parsifal (whose destiny as 
future guardian of the Grail demands otherwise)—comes to Arthur’s court and 
feels deeply tempted to abandon his quest for the Grail and remain there as a 
Knight of the Round Table.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
And then the Messenger arrives. But in what form? Her name is Kundrie, and she 
is compounded of all knowledge—languages, arts and sciences—but is everything 
that is hideous and repulsive to look upon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[6]</font><![endif]></span>“She 
wears a blue mantle and a hat of peacock’s feathers, and over her hat lies her 
plaited hair, black and coarse like the hackles of a pig. Her nose is like a 
dog’s. Two long tusks stick out of her mouth. Her eyebrows end in long 
pig-tails. Her ears are like the ears of a bear. . . . Her skin is the colour of 
an ape’s, and instead of nails she has lion’s claws. We need not look for beauty 
in her, for she is but the reflection of the inner part of man’s nature when it 
is still given over to desire. And yet—she is the Messenger of the Grail. No one 
will be surprised at this who has discovered how beautiful the hideous can be 
when it is transformed.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Kundrie upbraids Parsifal as false and untrue; he is forgetting the task to 
which he was predestined. She reminds him of his first entrance into the Grail 
Castle and his omission to ask questions concerning the Mysteries there; and she 
tells him how he <i>should</i> have asked—not only so as to redeem Amfortas the 
wounded King, but also his brother Fierefis. She recalls to his memory <i>that 
he has a brother</i>. For no one may approach the Grail alone; he must achieve 
the quest for the sake of the whole human race. He must take his brother with 
him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
This story is introduced here because we must try to feel a deep reverence for 
what lies concealed in these narratives. The great cosmic secrets of which the 
Arthur Knights still held the fast-fading memories, and which were deeply 
connected with the earthly mysteries of the human blood, with human egoism and 
passions and with the <i>shedding</i> of human blood, must be transformed into a 
recognition of the <i>Divine Ego of the Christ</i> which, in the Cup of the 
Grail, could be found now and in the future as the ILLUMINATOR of the true 
meaning of the old secrets of life and death and of incarnation, of which Arthur 
had been the last guardian in their form as a ‘Nature-Science.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
One who was destined for the Grail could not remain with Arthur.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire">We can read in the 
narratives how one by one the Knights of Arthur followed Parsifal in the quest 
for the Holy Grail; and how one by one they returned to the vanished glory of 
the Round Table—for most of them “did follow wandering fires.” ….<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
With wonderful spiritual insight Tennyson shows Arthur recognising that the 
Quest was not for him, but that he walked alone wrapped in the vision of what he 
had to guard for the distant future, feeling himself lost in an outer world that 
had become for him all ‘vision,’ with himself as a reality that ‘cannot die’—and 
the ‘High God’ a reality—and the ‘One Who rose again’ a reality. . . .</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
With the weakening of the Round Table came the last act of the drama, and the 
final overthrow of the Court of King Arthur, and his own ‘passing.’ As Sir 
Thomas Malory says: “Here in this world, he changed his life.” “He was had by 
the Lord Jesus in another place.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
When a human being dies, his physical body returns to the earthly element, his 
etheric body is dissolved in the cosmic ether, his astral body and his Ego take 
their way into the spiritual world. Dr. Steiner revealed a great Mystery—the 
reverse process—in connection with the descent of the Christ from the Cosmic 
spheres to the Earth. The Christ-Being <i>died to the Sun</i>, and leaving His 
‘Spirit-man’ in the sphere of the spiritual Sun, His Ego descended to earthly 
realm and His etheric body, or ‘Life-Spirit,’ permeated the aura of the Earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
We have seen that the integral heart of the Arthurian Mysteries consisted in <i>
the revelations that were obtained concerning the secrets of Nature and the 
human soul within the elemental or etheric aura of the Earth</i>; or, as has 
been stated, as a re-reading of the primeval Mysteries of the Heights and 
Depths, of the cosmic and terrestrial forces in the sphere of the elements of 
Fire and Air, Water and Earth. The whole movement of this evolution, beginning 
in Atlantis, had passed and was passing from West to East. The Mystery of 
Golgotha then took place in the East. From that moment the tremendous Impulse of 
the Christ travelled <i>from East to West</i>, in the Mysteries of the Holy 
Grail.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
“This stream, flowing from East to West,” says Rudolf Steiner, “is now not 
impressed in the winds and waves and air and water, or in mountains and the 
Sun’s rays as in the old way, but it flows through the blood, and into the 
hearts of men, taking hold of them. The one stream (the Arthur stream) lived in 
Nature, the other in the blood and hearts of men. . . . The Arthur stream came 
from the West, the other from the East. It was a meeting between the actual 
Christ Who came to Earth, with His Own etheric Form. Christ, the Brother of 
humanity, met with Himself in His cosmic Image.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
We need not feel this as something abstract. For always ‘that which is great 
becomes small’ as it writes itself upon the Earth in all the details of human 
life. It is played out in the destinies of men. Feeling this we can confidently 
include another character in the cosmic writing which Spiritual Science reads.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
We live today in an epoch which is governed by the same Spirit of the Age Who 
ruled at the time when the ‘pagan-Christian’ Arthur Mysteries played an 
important part in world-evolution a few centuries before Christ. This Being is 
known to us as the Archangel Michael. Whenever, at definite epochs, His 
influence streams into the Earth with the powers of the Sun, a cosmopolitan or 
‘world’ current affects civilisation. History, in the light of Anthroposophy, 
shows that this same force was active in Greece, whence the last great aftermath 
of the Atlantean Mysteries was carried all over the Eastern world, wherever 
Greek civilisation flourished, by <i>Alexander the Great</i>, three hundred 
years before Christ. This was a twin stream to the Arthur stream. And this 
stream also met and united with another, even as the Arthur stream met with the 
Grail; and this was the current of Arabian culture, which is the foundation of 
our modern materialistic Natural Science.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
In the early Middle Ages all <i>four</i> streams met together. They met in the 
spiritual world and they met on the Earth in individual human aims and actions, 
as history can testify. And in the ninth century<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[8]</font><![endif]></span> 
a fourfold knot of spiritual and human destiny was woven, out of which is 
working today the destinies of individual human beings, the destinies of 
nations, and of the whole civilisation of the Western world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
If we wish to know why it is that in the West the interest in King Arthur is 
deepening, it is because of this very fact. In the sublime Nature Science of the 
‘pagan Christians’ who saw the workings of the Sun-Being in the etheric aura of 
the earth, the revelation was still incomplete. But with the union of the 
Christ-on-Earth in the Grail Mysteries with this Nature Science—the meeting of 
Christ with His etheric Form—the germ of something infinitely precious for 
humanity was created. But it could not come to fruition until, after a thousand 
years or more, the fourfold knot of destiny could begin to be unravelled. Till 
then, Arthur must remain asleep. The time for the beginning of the awakening is 
in the present century, when Michael is again the Spirit of the Age.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
Rudolf Steiner has taught those who tread the path of Initiation that they must 
learn to distinguish ‘vision’ from spiritual reality. The difference between 
them is that in the ‘reality’ the Being, who was previously only ‘vision,’ <i>
has entered into the vision.</i> If we look then at the great and wonderful 
Mysteries of the Round Table and the Mysteries of the Grail, we see that in the 
latter the Being has indeed entered the vision and will now make it fruitful for 
the world through a newly apiritualised Natural Science! Anthroposophy, with its 
art, its school of medicine, its science of the etheric forces and its 
agriculture, is like the shepherd who found his way into the cave in the hills, 
and blowing upon the horn, wakened the sleeping Arthur and his Knights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
In the last hundred years modern natural science has discovered, in a purely 
materialistic way, the secrets of the ‘Depths’ in all forms of mechanisation and 
electrification. A wholly Platonic Round Table is being fashioned. The ‘Heights’ 
are unknown. The reverse picture of Michael’s cosmopolitan impulse is the 
dazzling glamour of Morgan le Fay, who unites East and West, and gives an 
illusion of ‘world-brotherhood,’ on the waves of electricity and the 
under-earthly forces. With prophetical insight an old Italian legend tells that 
she guards the sleeping Arthur in a wondrous fairy palace over the volcanic 
fires of Mount Etna, the grave of Empedocles, who sacrificed himself to the 
powers of the elements.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
But how much more wonderful is this fairy-tale when we look more deeply into it! 
For Rudolf Steiner tells us that Empedocles was the first philosopher—in the 
fifth century B.C.—who spoke of the four elements fire, water, earth, and air, 
and taught that everything that takes place in matter is caused by the mingling 
and commingling of these four elements in accordance with the principles of love 
and hatred ruling in them. Moreover, he says, “it is he who by his wisdom 
specially worked to bring about important conditions of the state of Sicily, and 
who went about trying to lead people into a spiritual life. It is an adventurous 
as well as a deeply spiritual life which we look back upon in Empedocles. 
Perhaps the truth of what is to be related may be doubted by some, but Spiritual 
Science knows that Empedocles moved in Sicily as a statesman, while at the same 
time he was both a magician and an Initiate, just as Hector in Troy was depicted 
by Homer. And in order to characterise the remarkable attitude of Empedocles to 
the world, we have the fact, which is true and no invention, that in order, as 
it were, to unite himself with all existence around him, he ended by throwing 
himself into Etna, and was consumed by its fire”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[9]</font><![endif]></span><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
And now a new <i>spiritual</i> natural science dawns in our age, the Michael 
Age, with Anthroposophy. Hand in hand with this spiritual natural science must 
go the healing force which will act—not now with the Sword, but through the 
Word—as the creator of a new social organism in which a new ideal of chivalry 
rules. Then the East will perceive that the terrible mechanisation and 
death-bringing forces of Western civilisation can be transmuted and healed by 
the wisdom of the Grail.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ire"><br>
The healing force which alone can create a spiritualised social order rises out 
of the wisdom of the Grail as <i>knowledge of re-incarnation.</i> Re-incarnation 
illumines the Mysteries of <i>Incarnation,</i> and gives meaning and splendour 
to all the tangled threads that bind human beings together in a mighty 
brotherhood of the Round Table.</span></p>

<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
<![endif]></span><span style="font-family: ire">From another aspect King Arthur 
may also be connected with <i>planetary</i> lore; and therefore I should like to 
draw attention to the mention earlier of King Arthur as the god <i>Artaius</i>, 
or Mercury (connected with that planet). Mercury represents the <i>healing</i> 
principle in the Universe. In Christian esotercism he is called Raphael, the 
Archangel. The staff of Mercury (otherwise the rod of Hermes) is the life-giving 
force that connects physical man with the spiritual worlds. It connects 
‘Science’ with ‘Light’; and is the force which overcomes the ‘Dragon of Blood.’ 
Britain has for its patron Saint, Saint George, who overcame the Dragon. Saint 
George is the earthly prototype of the Archangel Michael, and as such appears in 
a certain relation with Raphael; for Raphael is the Spiritual Being who carries 
out in the sphere of Humanity what <i>Michael</i> accomplishes in the Spiritual 
world. St. George’s Day falls precisely at the season when the influences of 
Raphael work most strongly—in the spring; while Michaelmas is at the opposite 
pole, in the autumn. St. George, with King Arthur (as ‘Mercury’), may thus be 
said to be human representatives of the Powers which (<i>a</i>) as <i>Michael</i>, 
give strength to the Will-impulses, in the great conflict between Life and 
Death—pictured for man in the falling leaves of autumn and the ripening of the 
seeds; and which (<i>b</i>) (as <i>Raphael</i>), continually renew the 
connection between man and the spiritual world, healing him; and this is 
pictured in the ever-recurring life of spring. It is not for nothing that Great 
Britain, which is the gateway between East and West, has given birth to the idea 
of these great human representatives of ‘Mercury’ and the ‘Sun’; and that it 
possesses (though the meaning is forgotten) an “Order of St. Michael and St. 
George.”</span></h5>
