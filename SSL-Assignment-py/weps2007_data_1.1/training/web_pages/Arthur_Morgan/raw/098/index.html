<p>Notes for Jacob Morgan:</p>
<p>Jacob and Minerva were married by Caleb Hedges, a Justice of the Peace. Jacob
made everyone in his household read the Bible at least an hour everyday whether
they wanted to or not. He was rather a tyrant. They lived 3 miles from their
church in Kansas and everyone had to walk to church every Sunday. In order to
save wear and tear on their shoes, everyone had to take off their shoes to walk
those 3 miles, then put them back on just before entering the church. Jacob was
a penny-pincher, yet he always gave quite a bit of money to the circuit riders
and preachers. [Roy Morgan via Lois Morgan]</p>
<p>Jacob was on the 1860 Perry Township, Hocking County, Ohio Census [p 207,
enumerated 8 August 1860] aged 30 OH, farmer with Minerva, 27 OH; Caroline, 5
OH; Samuel C., 3 OH; and Amos, 1 OH. He was in Girard, Crawford Township,
Crawford County, Kansas for the 1870 census [p 360a-b, enumerated 23 June 1870]
aged 37 OH, farmer, RE $2000, PP $1000; with Minerva, 36 OH; Caroline, 15 OH;
Saml C., 13 OH; Amos, 11 OH; Eleanora, 8 OH; William N., 6; and Sarah J., 5/12
KS, b. January. Caroline and William had attended school within the year.</p>
<p>Jacob was on the 1880 Crawford Township, Crawford County, Kansas Census [p 8,
from Soundex card] aged 49 OH with Minerva, 46 OH; Samuel C., 23 OH; Amos, 21
OH; Elenora, 18 OH; W. Martin, 15 OH; Sarah J., 10 KS; and Ida May, 8 KS.</p>
<p>On February 1884 Jacob was made the legal guardian of Florence Hurless in
Crawford County, Kansas because her mother, Susan Hurless, had died in Illinois.
Florence was about 14 years of age. The record stated that Jacob was her
&quot;uncle,&quot; which was true because Susan was his wife Minerva's sister.
[Lois Morgan]</p>
<p>He was in Girard, Crawford County, Kansas for the 1900 Census [p. 17]. Jacob,
74 OH, Clara, 35 KS, and Rolla Morgan, 10 KS, were listed on the 1905 Walnut

Supervisor's District #2, Enumerator's District #179.). He married <b>Mary Ann

and died 05 December 1895 in Girard, Crawford County, Kansas (Source: <i>Morgan,
Mary Ann (Hedges) Death Certificate #903</i>, recorded in Crawford County,
Kansas Book D, p 2, Line 4.).</p>
<p>Notes for Samuel A. Morgan:</p>
<p>Samuel was first found as head of househead on the 1860 Perry Township,
Hocking County, Ohio Census [p.205, enumerated 8 August 1860] aged 27 OH,
laborer, along with Mary Ann, 19 OH; Lovinah, 6/12 OH; and his siblings, George
Morgan, 21 OH, laborer; Wm H. Morgan, 17 OH, laborer; David Morgan, 15 OH,
laborer; Louisa J. Morgan, 11 OH; and Joseph Morgan, 6 OH. Mary Ann could not
read or write and William, David, Louisa and Joseph had attended school during
the year.</p>
<p>Samuel was on the 1870 Curran, Sangamon County, Illinois Census [p 129b,
enumerated 23 June 1870] aged 36 OH, Farm Laborer--PP $150; Mary A., 28 OH; and
Lovenia, 10 OH, attending school. He died prior to the 1880 Rock Creek Township,
Cowley County, Kansas Census and was found in that township on the 1880 Kansas
Mortality Schedule [p 4] aged 48 white male born Ohio with parents both born
Pennsylvania, laborer died April 1880 in accident, lived in county 4 years and
doctor not attending death.</p>
<p>Samuel was a laborer at a sawmill near the present-day towns of Udall and
Winfield, Kansas when he was killed in an accident at Jones' sawmill. At the
time he was 48 years old and had lived in Cowley County four years prior to the
accident. Mary Ann died 15 years later of pneumonia at age 54.</p>
<p>From the &quot;Monitor,&quot; a weekly newspaper published in Winfield,
Cowley County, Kansas on Saturday, 3 April 1880, p 3, column 2: &quot;Yesterday
morning about ten o'clock a fatal accident happened at Jones' sawmill, eight
miles north of the city. Mr. Morgan, one of the hands, was attempting to adjust
some of the belting to the machinery, his clothing by some means or other caught
in the belting and machinery, and before he could be rescued by his comrades was
crushed to death. We are not in full possession of the details, having only a
few moments talk with our informant, Mr. Lowe, who came in for the
coroner.--Telegram&quot; [Ron Hess, [E-mail], 2 July 1998]</p>
<p>Another report from the &quot;Monitor,&quot; dated 10 April 1880, p 2, column
4: &quot;Mr. Morgan was instantly killed at Jones sawmill a few days ago. He
leaves a wife and two [sic-should be 3] children in very destitute
circumstances. They have the sympathy of the entire community.&quot; Another
article stated that Samuel's head was mashed and several ribs were broken.</p>
<p>After Samuel's death Mary Ann and her three youngest children lived with
daugher Lovina Kistler and her family in Rock Creek Twp, Cowley County, Kansas
[p. 11, enumerated 6-7 June 1880] in 1880 with Jesse aged 27 PA PA PA, farmer;
Lovina, 20 IL OH OH; Charles, 1 KS PA IL; Mary Morgan, 39 OH PA US, mother in
law &amp; widowed; Frank Morgan, 8 IL PA OH, brother in law; Edgar Morgan, 5 IL
PA OH, brother in law; and Bessie Morgan, 1 KS PA OH, sister in law.</p>
<p>Since Lovina died about 7 months after her father, Mary Ann might have stayed
with her son-in-law Jesse to help him raise Lovina's children. Lovina's two sons
were drowned on 5 August 1890 [Winfield Courier] and are buried beside their
mother in the Akron Cemetery, also known as the Green Valley, Walnut Valley or
Pate Cemeteries, Fairview Township, Cowley County, Kansas. [&quot;Tombstone
Inscriptions, Cowley County, Kansas, V. 2, p 71] However the book Tombstone
Inscriptions has two errors, first, Lovina's youngest son Frank's age of 6 years
makes him too young to have been her child and he was not listed on the 1880
census with the family. The second is an error regarding the year of Lovina's
husband Jesse's death which was given as 1881, but should have been 1899 if he
died aged 47 years.</p>
<p>Mary Ann was very poor after Samuel's death and had to work as a domestic to
try to keep the family together. It appears that none of Samuel's brothers
helped her financially or even kept much in contact with her. By 1895 she was
living with and working for the Stanley Ayers family in Sheridan Township,
Crawford County, Kansas. Bessie lived with the Estes family and was working as a
maid. [1895 Kansas State Census, pp. 22-23] At this time it is not known where
Frank or Arthur were, but most likely they were out on their own and supporting
themselves. Frank has never been found on a census after 1880.</p>
<p>Daughter Lovina and Jesse Kistler were married at her father's home in
Crawford Township by James Murray, Pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church.
Lovina died aged 20y 8m 8d.</p>
<p>Daughter Bessie was born east of Girard and lived most of her life there. She
and John Spillman were married by T. W. Stutterd, Probate Judge. At the time of
her marriage, Bessie lived in Cherokee, Crawford County, Kansas and John was
from Monmouth, Crawford County, Kansas. Bessie died at the Girard Rest Home just
before her 96th birthday. Her daughters all married and are listed here with
their married names: Nina Carter, Wincell Strasser, Elva Farmer and Vivian Hess.</p>

          <p>Arthur and Lula were married by T. W. Stutterd, Probate Judge. At
          that time Arthur lived in Frontenac, Crawford County, Kansas and Lula
          was from Midway, Kansas.</p>
          <p>Arthur first appears as head of household in 1900 Washington Twp,
          Crawford County, Kansas [p. 21] and stated that he lived alone
          although married while his wife Lula lived elsewhere. They must have
          divorced soon afterwards because Maude, in her Social Security
          Application dated 31 July 1958, stated that her mother's name was
          Effie May Stanley and her father's name was Edward Arthur Morgan.
          Maude also stated that she was born in Enid, Garfield County,
          Oklahoma. [Note: no marriage for Arthur to Effie has been found in
          Kansas or Oklahoma.]</p>
          <p>Wayne Cook [interviewed September 1998] recalled that he had been
          told that Maude was around 3 or 4 years old when her mother died. She
          remembered the funeral because she was crying and would not stop, so
          she was being carried around and comforted by her father when a man
          passed by with a flower on his lapel. Arthur snatched the flower and
          gave it to Maude, who promptly stopped crying. By 1910 Arthur had
          remarried and lived in Ozark Twp, Barton County, Missouri [census p.
          5b]. He died of a carcinoma of the left jaw.</p>

<p>Notes for Amos Weldon Hedges:</p>
<p>&quot;Amos Hedges, farmer and stock-raiser, was born in Perry Twp, Fairfield
(now Hocking) County, Ohio, 17 November 1833, a son of Caleb and Mary (Clelan)
Hedges. His father was born 4 March 1789 and his mother 2 February 1794, near
Georgetown, Maryland, of English descent. They were married in 1814. His father
came to Ohio in 1812 and located the farm where our subject was born. In the
spring of 1813 he planted a cherry-tree, which at the present writing (1883) is
3 1/2 feet in diameter. Mrs. Hedges died in February, 1856 and Mr. Hedges in
October 1875. He had filled many offices of trust, both in the church and
township. Amos Hedges is still living in the house where he was born. He was
married 11 October 1855 to Sarah J. Morgan, daughter of George and Elizabeth
(Shuck) Morgan, natives of Pennsylvania, who came to Perry Twp in 1843. They
have the following children: Caleb Russell; Clark died October 1876 aged 16
years; Eliza; Mary S.; Cora D.; Emma May; Amos W.; and 2 that died in infancy.
Mr. and Mrs. Hedges are members of the Methodist Church. Mr. Hedges has been a
Justice of the Peace since 1879. He has a fine farm of 160 acres.&quot;
[&quot;History of Hocking Valley, Ohio,&quot; (1883), p 1118]</p>
<p>Amos and Sarah were probably married at the Betheny Methodist Church at
Middlefork, Hocking County, Ohio, because Amos and his father Caleb were lay
ministers of this church and it was on their land that they had donated to the
church. Sarah was buried by two of her granddaughters who died young and there
is no headstone for her eventhough she was much loved and daughter Emma was
quite weathy. Amos and his family had lost quite a lot of money on a note they
had signed for a relative and there was probably no money at the time of Sarah
Jane's death to get her a monument.</p>
<p>Amos was on the 1880 Perry Township, Hocking County, Ohio Census [p 116c]
aged 46 OH MA MA, farmer; with Sarah J., 45 OH PA PA; Kaleb R., 21 OH PA PA,
farmer; Elizabeth E., 17 OH OH OH; Mary S., 15 OH OH OH; Cora D., 13 OH OH OH;
Emma M., 10 OH OH OH; Amos W., 5 OH OH OH; and niece Cora Reynolds, 6 OH OH OH.
After being widowed, Amos followed his sons to Colorado.</p>
<p>Daughter Eliza fell in love with handsome William Creiglow, but Amos and
Sarah considered him beneath her socially and would not allow them to marry. So,
educated, brilliant, arrogant lady that she was, Eliza got pregnant, but still
her parents would not relent. So, she got pregnant again. She told her parents
that &quot;I will love him 'til the sky and the earth meet.&quot; Finally, Amos
relented, but refused to marry them in the Betheny Methodist Church, so he
married them himself at his home. Eliza's daughter Daisy died of scarlet fever
at age 6 years. Eliza was still living at age 99 on 6 December 1997. [Lynn Scheu]</p>
<p>Daughter Mary was known as &quot;Aunt Maime.&quot; She divorced Thomas
Walters and moved to California and opened a beauty shop, but the 1905(?)
earthquake put her out of business. [Lynn Scheu]</p>

<p>Notes for William Harrison Morgan:</p>
<p>William served in the Civil War from Hocking County, Ohio. He enlisted on 7
October 1861 aged 18 years in Company I of the 58th Regiment of the Ohio
Volunteer Infantry as a private and drummer. He saw action in the Battle of
Shiloh and in the sieges of Cornith and Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was Honorably
Discharged on 14 January 1865.</p>
<p>After marriage on 20 August 1865, William and Mary Ann lived with her family
and they all came to Kansas together in 1872 and settled about 1 1/2 miles
northwest of Dennis, Labette County on 80 acres. They came to this area at an
interesting time for, out on the high prairie a mile northwest of Parsons and
1/2 mile from Dennis, in 1871 the Bender family, consisting of John, his wife,
his son John and daughter Kate, came and settled. John Bender built a small
cabin on the well-traveled main road that was partitioned into two rooms by a
canvas cloth hung from the roof. It was furnished in the front section with a
table, stove and grocery shelves and called the Bender Inn. In back were beds, a
sledge hammer and a trap door above a pit-like cellar. When travelers stopped
for a meal, they were seated on a bench backed tightly against the canvas
partition where, while eating, they were bashed on the head with the hammer by
one of the Benders and dropped into the pit. Suspicions were finally aroused in
1873 after 11 men had vanished and the Benders fled. William Morgan was a member
of the posse that went after and caught them.</p>
<p>William was on the 1870 Union Township, Van Wert County, Ohio Census [p 393b,
enumerated 23 June 1870] aged 26 OH, farmer, PP $300; Mary A., 26 OH; Mary E., 4
OH; John T., 3 OH; and Wm F., 1 OH.</p>
<p>He was on the 1880 Osage Township, Labette County, Kansas Census [p. 28,
enumerated 22 June 1880] aged 38 OH OH OH, farmed; Mary A., 37 OH OH OH; Mary
E., 14 OH OH OH; John T., 13 OH OH OH; Wm Fred, 12 OH OH OH; Joseph W., 5 KS OH
OH OH; and David B., 1 KS OH OH. Mary, John and Fred had attended school within
the year. Later, William purchased land from the Eisley family in Paw Paw Twp,
Elk County, Kansas and they were there for the 1900 census [p. 9] and had a
niece, Viola Babzion b. August 1887 Kansas, living with them. The land in Paw
Paw Township stayed in the Morgan family until 1994.</p>
<p>Viola Bobzien took care of her ailing uncle in his last days. William farmed
until 1901 and then they moved into Howard where William was employed by the
Gibbon Lumber Company. They belonged to the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>In 1919, their grandson, Wilbert Morgan, lived with them while he went to
high school in Howard, Elk County, Kansas. Wilbert slept in the cellar, as there
wasn't any room in the house. At that time, it was either that or ride his
bicycle 8 miles (one way) into town everyday, even in bad weather.</p>
<p>William's and Mary Ann's obituaries: &quot;William Harrison Morgan was born
in Harrison county, Ohio, May 17, 1843 and departed this life, February 7, 1929,
at the age of 85 years, 8 months and 21 days. When seven weeks old he with his
parents moved to Hocking county, Ohio, where he lived until grown. He was united
in marriage to Mary Ann Eisley at Middlefork, Ohio, August 20, 1865, who
preceded him to her Heavenly Home on January 11, 1929. Five children came to
bless their hom. One daughter, Mary Elizabeth Small who departed this life June
18, 1921; J. T. Morgan of Howard, W. T. Morgan of Pomona, California, J. W.
Morgan and D. B. Morgan of Howard. Twelve grandchildren and eleven great
grandchildren living and one little granddaughter in heaven. He is also survived
by one brother, Joseph A. Morgan of Kimberly, Idaho and Mrs. A. C. Walters and
Miss Viola Bobzien, sister and niece of Mrs. Morgan, were taken into their home
when they were children, the latter remaining and caring for both Mr. and Mrs.
Morgan in their old age. Both she and Mrs. Walters survive. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan
moved from Ohio to Labette county, Kansas, in 1872, coming from there to the
farm, north of Howard in 1880, where they lived until moving to Howard in 1901.
They lived together nearly 64 years, being separated in death by only 27 days.
He desired not to live longer, but wished to join her on the other Shore. He
entered the Union army, October 7, 1861, enlisting in Company I, 58th Regiment,
Ohio Volunteer Infantry and was honorably discharged January 14, 1865. He was in
the battle of Shiloh and sieges of Cornith and Vicksburg. Mr. Morgan was
converted at the age of sixteen and united with the Methodist Episcopal church
of which he was a faithful, loyal member to the end of life. Soon after coming
to Elk county he with a few others organized a Sunday school at the Orr school
house where he did effective work. Later the Sunday school was moved to the
Antioch school house. This was the beginning of the Antioch church. His efforts
in the Sunday school and church were untiring, serving constantly either as
teacher or superintendent of the Sunday school, also as class leader and other
offices of the church. He was always ready to help and assist the young
ministers who served on the Howard circuit and a welcome always awaited them at
his home and fireside. As a husband, father, neighbor, friend, he was a true
man, always ready to help and serve others. His children love and serve his
memory. He will answer to the roll call no more, but has gone on to join the
army of the Redeemed. Funeral services were held at the M. E. church, at Howard,
Saturday afternoon, February 9th, 1929, conducted by Rev. E. E. Satterlee, the
pastor. Burial in Grace Lawn cemetery at Howard. We wish to extend our heartfelt
thanks to all our friends for their expressions of sympathy, ministrations of
helpfulness and for the beautiful flowers so kindly given during the illness and
death of our father and uncle. Children of W. H. Morgan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary Ann Eisley, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Eisley was born in
Hocking county, Ohio, July 1, 1844 and departed this life January 11, 1929, aged
84 years, 6 months and 10 days. She was united in marriage to W. H. Morgan at
Middlefork, Ohio, August 20, 1885. They were the parents of five children:
Elizabeth Small, who departed this life June 18, 1921; J. T. Morgan of Howard;
W. F. Morgan of Pomona, California and J. W. and D. B. Morgan of Howard. She had
four sisters and three brothers all of whom have passed on before. There are
also twelve grandchildren, and eleven great grandchildren living and one little
granddaughter in heaven. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan moved from Ohio to Labette county,
Kansas, in 1872, coming from there to the farm north of Howard in 1880, where
they lived until moving to Howard in 1901. Here she lived with her husband who
survives her until her life journey ended. Thus it will be seen that they were
married nearly 64 years. Sister Morgan was converted at the age of eighteen and
united with the Methodist Episcopal church of, which she was a faithful member
to the last. After she was unable to attend the Sunday worship she would sit and
read the word of God while the rest of the family attend the church services.
Her home, especially when they were still on the farm was the stopping-place of
many ministers, expecially those younger men who were on the Howard circuit,
among whom was our present district superintendent Dr. R. E. Maclean. She was
not only a kind and loving mother to her own family, but for more than a year
she cared for a small nephew who was in very delicate health but who was
restored to health through her constant care. Later on she took two nieces, Mrs.
A. C. Walters and Miss Viola Bobzien into her home and loving heart. Miss
Bobzien lived in the home and cared for her in her old age and last sickness.
Mrs. Morgan always talked freely of her Christian life and her hope of the
heavenly home and though in these later years, she has always been anxious to go
she would always say, &quot;God's will not mine.&quot; &quot;Servant of God,
well done! Thy glorious warfare's past; The battle's fought, the race is run.
And thou art crowned at last.&quot; Funeral services were held at the Methodist
church, Sunday afternoon, January 13th, 1929; conducted by Rev. E. E. Satterlee,
pastor and burial at Grace Lawn cemetery, Howard. The family extends to the wide
circle of friends who so kindly ministered during Mrs. Morgan's illness, and to
all those who sent flowers, or in any other way contributed to their comfort,
their most hearty thanks.&quot;</p>
