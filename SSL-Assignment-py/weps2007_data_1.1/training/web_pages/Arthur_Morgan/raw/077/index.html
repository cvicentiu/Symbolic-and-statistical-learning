<P>The concluding novel of the trilogy (1983, 1985) set in pre-Arthurian times with incidental
references to Arthurian characters and events to come. This is the story of Madouc, Princess of
Lyonesse, and it incorporates her quest for the Holy Grail which resembles a fairy tale adventure
much more than an episode in a medieval romance. The girl's father is revealed to be Sir Pellinore.</P>

(June 1989). Comic book. New York: DC Comics.</B></P>
<blockquote>
<P>A comic book story in which the title creature, Swamp Thing, is taken back to Arthur's time to save
Camelot from destruction by the armies of Modred and Morgaine Lefay. In addition to such comic book
characters with Arthurian connections as the Shining Knight and the Demon, the creature encounters
Merlin and a Grail-crazed King Arthur as Camelot falls. In the following issue, no.88, Swamp Thing
sees the Grail pass from a Neanderthal tribe to the rapacious Homo sapiens in a story written by
Doug Wheeler. The story replaced one that would have had the creature meet Christ at the
Crucifixion, which was cancelled out of concern about offense to readers and which resulted in the
resignation of the writer Veitch from the series, generating some coverage in the national press.
Whether the Grail figured in the cancelled story is unknown, although one news article mentions the
creature appearing as an angel who offers Christ a cup in the Garden of
Gethsemanee.</P>
