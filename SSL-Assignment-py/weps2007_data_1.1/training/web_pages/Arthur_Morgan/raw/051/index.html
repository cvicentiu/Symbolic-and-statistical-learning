In recounting some details of the life of Celo's founder, Arthur E. Morgan,
it is not my intention to endorse a "great man" theory of history or a
psychological explanation for Celo Community's existence. The primary
purpose is rather to deepen the understanding of Celo's history, to explore
the assortment of factors which led to its birth and lengthy endurance. For
this purpose, it is significant that, in his own view, Morgan's career as
professional engineer was secondary to his role as moral tutor. He
considered himself above all an educator, not just for the particular
projects he directed but as a model-maker for the nation as a whole. A lack
of formal education did not deter him from becoming an acclaimed college
president and the first head of the Tennessee Valley Authority. His
reputation as scholar and social philosopher was enhanced by his many books
and articles, and by his association with intellectuals like John Dewey and
H. G. Wells. With Ralph Borsodi, Rexford Tugwell, and others, he gained a
national reputation for his advocacy of moral reform and he was, like
Dewey, a strong advocate of the position that the basis of American
civilization was the small community. And only his life history can convey
his attitude of arrogant self-righteousness observed by many associates.</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps most important for Celo Community, Morgan had firm associations
with business and industrial leaders which paved the way for Celo's
financial security. Quite different from other similar community
experiments, Celo began with solid financial support. Finally, although
Morgan paid only brief visits to Celo over the years, the members
constantly aspired to exhibit his ideas in the Community's structure.</font>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Morgan's Early Years</font></h3>


<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Born into a family of modest circumstances in 1878, Arthur Morgan is easily
taken as an example of that American hero, the self-made man. His father
was a self-taught engineer and surveyor. As Morgan's wife recalled,
doubtless basing her opinion on what she had heard from her husband, the
father "had considerable initiative along some lines, but his 'laziness,'
from whatever cause it sprang, kept him from following his calling
energetically, and prevented him all his life from being a success
financially" (L. Morgan 1928, 6; see also Morgan 1957b, 7-10; Talbert 1987,
9). Morgan's mother, "a slight and rigidly puritanical schoolma'am from
Massachusetts" (L. Morgan 1928, 17), molded Arthur into "a most pious young
man" (Talbert 1987, 9).
<!--_noteRef_-->
<sup><a name="ref1" href="ch4.html#foot1

<!--_/noteRef_-->
 Nevertheless, his father's scientific interests won out over the mother's
religious convictions and, from early in his high school years, Morgan
maintained a liberal religious outlook and a strong interest in science.</font>

<!--_/text_no_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of sixteen Morgan had a vision of an ideal community. It was an
experience so impressive that, even at age ninety, he could give a detailed
account of it. Obviously the extent to which his memory was embellished by
a lifetime of utopian experimentation is unknown, but his vision provides
an unusual glimpse of concrete details otherwise lacking in his many
prescriptions for utopia. As he described it,</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->


<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size = "-1">
There was a group of houses, unpainted and in the natural wood color, with
perhaps four to eight rooms. There were also a blacksmith shop, barns, farm
lands, and some little industries. Living standards were very simple
indeed. The teachers or leaders lived in modest homes with or near the boys
and girls. They all learned practical things by the processes of living,
and a philosophy of life by reading and group discussions and by thinking
things out by themselves. There was complete freedom to think, to inquire
and to doubt, but also a strong spirit of aspiration, of commitment, and of
self-discipline. The product of the school would be young men and women who
had achieved a way of life, and who had learned how to make a living
without compromising their convictions, who had learned to love nature, and
who had an appetite for mental and spiritual growth.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">


<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size = "-1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had come to the conclusion that the way to build a new world was to build
it on a small scale, where a desirable life might be lived in all respects,

language but all the elements were there.</font>

it. But gradually I began to think&#151;perhaps I can do it. (quoted from
tape recorded interview, Leuba 1971, 55-56)</font>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living with kinsmen in Denver for a few years, Morgan dropped out of
college after two attempts, took various jobs at casual labor, then
returned to Minnesota in 1900 to work with his father as an engineer.
Within a few years, he had achieved a reputation as a specialist in
drainage and flood control engineering and held offices in Minnesota's
state engineers society. His stature as an engineer grew as he took on more
projects in the design of flood control dams.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his work in the aftermath of the devastating flood of 1913 in
Dayton, Ohio, however, that brought him national prominence. Called in to
design a series of dams to prevent a recurrence of a flood that had left
three hundred dead and huge property damage, Morgan systematically
collected data on floods in this country and Europe. Based on this
research, Morgan designed and built five earthen dry dams, which
"represented a new concept in this country.... Morgan was the first to put
the principle into operation" (Talbert 1987, 37).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his ideas about social reform, Morgan was a Progressive. Underlying the
moral authoritarianism of Progressivism, certainly for Morgan and the young
engineers of his acquaintance, was a "propensity to assume a moral and
scientific advantage over other people" (Talbert 1987, 33). Moral elitism
formed a consistent theme of Morgan's writings and plans for reform: as he
declared in 1930, "in ethics, as in every field, genius sets standards
which become authority to those who recognize excellence, even where they
cannot create" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 57). There is no doubt that Morgan
included himself among those who set authoritative standards.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan found support for his plans for reform in his personal life as well.
His first marriage, in 1904, ended with the death of his wife within a
year, leaving him with an infant son. His second wife, Lucy, whom he
married in 1911, became his lifelong companion and partner in a number of
efforts at social improvement. A teacher of chemistry and home economics at
Wellesley College, Lucy was a Quaker with ardent reformist tendencies: "as
a nutrition expert she could be righteous in her assertion of the necessity
of a proper diet and efficient, moral living" (Talbert 1987, 28). She seems
to have revived the visions of Morgan's youth, and she shared his dream of
creating a model community and school.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As important as preventing floods through innovative dam construction, in
Morgan's view, was the opportunity offered by the Ohio project for
wholesome improvement. He built new model communities for workers, with day
schools for children, and set up night classes where immigrants could learn
English, along with technical skills and ethical codes. He provided health
and accident insurance for workers, with newspapers, recreational programs,
and town meetings at each work site. As his biographer, Roy Talbert Jr.,
notes, "reform, both technical and social, was the order of the day, and no
other major construction project could boast such enlightened leadership"
(1987, 37; see also McCraw 1970, 8).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the successful completion of the Ohio flood control project, Morgan
abandoned any day-to-day involvement with the engineering profession and
turned his efforts in other directions, beginning with educational reform.
While still living in Ohio, he established an alternative to what he and
his associates perceived as the inferior public schools of Dayton.
Supported by a number of business leaders&#151;among them were Edward
Deeds, chairman of Ohio's flood control board; Charles Kettering, inventor
of the electric automobile starter; and Orville Wright&#151;Morgan founded
the Moraine Park School as a coeducational program with classes from
kindergarten through college preparatory. It opened in 1917 with sixty
students. Although his involvement rapidly diminished, it was Morgan's
educational ideas that found concrete expression in the curricular
principle that the learning of values outweighed the learning of facts. The
school stressed self-reliance, student self-governance, and student
participation in teaching. A 1920 handbook of private schools singled out
Moraine Park School as "one of the most promising educational experiments
in recent years" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 43).</font>

<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association with the experimental school in Dayton led to national
recognition for Morgan, and he was asked by the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> to write about his educational ideas. He took the opportunity to issue a
sharp criticism of the separation of education from practical matters
(1918). Morgan was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pestalozzi and
modern American educators and writers, including John Dewey, that education
had to do with real life and should not be separated from it. For the next
two decades, the pages of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> served up Morgan's ideas on civilization, education, and community in
article after article (e.g., Morgan 1942a).

<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
These achievements were but prologue to Morgan's greatest opportunity, this
time as a college president, to influence American educational practice. In
1921 he became president of Antioch College. The college trustees, having
failed to sell the financially stricken college to the YMCA, named Morgan
to the board of trustees in 1919. Within six weeks he had devised a plan to
rescue the school from financial ruin and to overhaul the educational
program.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_no_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife fondly recalled traveling with him from Dayton to Yellow Springs,
Ohio, just prior to Morgan's appointment: "We will never forget that
trip.... Arthur's verdict was, 'I believe it is near enough dead to start
over in the form I dream of.' We decided to give up the idea of a school at
Jacob's Pillow [Massachusetts], and dedicated our lives to embodying our
dreams at Antioch College" (L. Morgan 1928, 100).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with a broad grant of authority from the trustees, Morgan radically
restructured the college curriculum. The result was what became known as
the Antioch Plan. Although it was not his invention, and he many times
disclaimed credit for the plan, Morgan became identified as its initiator.
As first conceived, Morgan wanted a number of small industries near the
college, to "provide practical life experiences for students, an income for
the college, and an opportunity to pioneer in creating a new industrial
atmosphere in which the profit motive, though present and essential, would
be subordinated to more significant human values" (Leuba 1971, 151).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of the Antioch Plan called for each student to spend four
hours per day in class and four hours working at a job in the community.
Unable to attract sufficient industry where students could shift from class
to work, he was forced to modify the work/study plan by broadening the
geographical area for employment and setting the alternation of work and
study at periods of several months rather than by hours per day. Morgan's
accomplishments at Antioch flowed directly from his conviction that school
and community, life and education, should not be separated. In the
assessment of his biographer, "What Morgan did that was innovative was to
extend the cooperative concept to the liberal arts program. All students at
Antioch would work, whether they needed the money or not. In making
practical experience a core requirement, Morgan introduced the pioneering
aspect of his work at Antioch and made his greatest contribution to modern
American higher education" (Talbert 1987, 48).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a year of Morgan's inauguration, Antioch's enrollment quadrupled,
from less than one hundred to four hundred students, its faculty doubled,
and the revived college was the subject of numerous newspaper and magazine
stories. The new curriculum received the endorsement of many nationally
known writers and educators. More important for the long term, the Antioch
Plan attained permanence and was adopted in some form by a number of
American colleges.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Morgan was disappointed; his success at Antioch fell far
short of what he had envisioned. He had begun with wide powers to hire and
fire. As a condition of accepting the presidency, he had demanded, and
received, the resignations of all trustees and faculty. Very few incumbents
of either category were reappointed; Morgan's new twenty-member faculty
included only five who had taught at Antioch before 1921. Ruling the
college with a heavy hand, Morgan aimed at more than educational reform:
Antioch would be the place where new standards of morality were developed.
In his vision, the college should serve as a model for the moral
regeneration of American society in general (Talbert 1987, 61).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Antioch were to become no more than a respected liberal arts college,
then he wanted out. As he announced to his faculty in 1931, he had hoped to
build at Antioch a community with spiritual qualities and "a marked and
sustained difference of purpose and of commitment from those of society at
large" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 64). But his efforts reaped only
disenchantment. As he said, "When I compare Antioch with what I believe to
be my reasonable expectations for such an institution, and what were
certainly my hopes for Antioch, I feel a very keen disappointment.... I am
disappointed that we do not break through the current ways of life with
greater creative discontent.... We too largely accept as a whole the mental
and emotional pattern of the day and we are bent chiefly on improving and
refining it in detail" (quoted, Leuba 1971, 160).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic problem was a contradiction in Morgan's leadership. On the one
hand, he repeatedly called for students and faculty to eschew conventional
morality and to seek their own standards through rigorous and independent
thinking. Yet, on the other, he demanded total allegiance from faculty,
staff, and students, including adherence to the moral code promulgated by
Arthur E. Morgan. From the beginning of his term as Antioch's president, in
Talbert's words, "To work for Morgan meant either to become his devotee or
to leave. Only those who shared the vision could stay. His relationships,
like his morality, were absolute, and he had a way of forcing conversion or
rejection" (1987, 54). It was not a new attitude in Morgan's dealings with
others, and the label of "sanctimonious Yankee moralist and mystic," given
him by one historian (Shi 1985, 237), was not far off the mark. The Antioch
faculty posed the problem to him in a straightforward question: "Is it
possible to conduct a college with definite moral aims on democratic
principles?" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 65).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan discerned serious deficiencies in democratic procedures. Democracy
was wasteful, for one thing, and thus contrary to his progressive
principles of efficiency. "In the determination of public issues," he
declared in 1936, "the ballot of the most stupid and ignorant voter counts
as much as that of the wisest and most public spirited. By this arbitrary
device valuable resources of public judgment are lost" (1936, 67). He had
for many years made business decisions along Quaker lines, through his
conception of consensus. This did not mean, he wrote, "taking formal votes
on the 'one man, one vote' principle. Consensus of judgment may be arrived
at by the deference of the many who do not know to the superior judgment of
the few who do. The balance of competence to judge may shift endlessly as
different subjects for judgment arise" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 150). There
was no question that Morgan counted himself among the competent on most
issues.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His relations with the faculty continued to deteriorate. Convinced of
failure in his attempt to build a model for a new society, but that the
failure was largely due to character faults of faculty members and
students, Morgan prepared to leave Antioch. He was saved from the distress
of an unpleasant separation by President Roosevelt's call to service as the
first chairman of the new Tennessee Valley Authority. For Morgan, it was a
summons to a moral pulpit of far grander proportions than that available to
a college president. It was a chance to construct a new society to match
his vision.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->


<h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Visions of Community</font></h3>


<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Morgan firmly believed that the small community was the indispensable
foundation of civilization. Over many years, in one book and article after
another, he argued for the superiority of small communities, not as they
existed but as they might become. American communities, deficient in
imagination and cultural variety, were sterile and provincial, victims of
"great, centralized, impersonal organizations" which had steadily erased
the "intimate and refining influences of small communities" (Morgan 1942b,
280). No wonder most young people in such places left as soon as possible!
An advocate of eugenics, he asserted that "one of the most dysgenic customs
has been for the abler, more vigorous and more purposeful young people to
leave the small communities, where people more generally have large
families, for the cities where in the past the birth rate has been
altogether too low to replace the parents" (Morgan 1957c, 148-49).
Communities were indispensable, he wrote, for the preservation of
democracy. Individual freedom must be nourished but it can only exist where
there is "mutual regard and responsibility" (Morgan 1942b, 280). Blending
community life and democratic government, he wrote, is</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_no_indent_-->


<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size = "-1">
to save and to enlarge the priceless values of [individual] freedom, while
yet developing the qualities of mutual regard, mutual help, mutual
responsibility, and common effort for common ends. That is the problem of
democracy. Actual democracy cannot originate in large masses or by
legislation. It is a way of life which must be learned by the intimate
associations of family and community. While the community is developing a
sense of mutual responsibility, and while it is working out common plans,
there should be constant endeavor to save individual freedom and
initiative. (Morgan 1942b, 280-81)

<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to create new communities, particularly the utopian experiments of
the nineteenth century, elicited his admiration. Critical of Oneida and
Amana (among others) as "lacking a mature and well-proportioned concept of
the community as a fundamental element of human culture," Morgan
nevertheless applauded them as worthy experiments (1942b, 101). "The
creation of new communities ... [is] among the more important and universal
ways in which societies the world over have maintained their vitality and
have advanced in type" (Morgan 1957c, 140-41). Building intentional
communities has been one of the "great creative forces in history," and the
great "proportion of failures" should not blind us to the recognition that
"the rewards and fruits of those that have succeeded have extended to the
furthest reaches of mankind" (141). One way to achieve success in
community-building, he suggested, was that such communities, each with "its
own unique character," might associate themselves and "each perform some
service which helps the whole to meet varied needs" (144).</font>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from his inspirational and practical advisories, Morgan tackled
utopianism from a scholarly angle. As a young man he was captivated by
Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking Backward</i> and took Bellamy as a model for himself (McCraw 1970). Later, he published
a well-received biography of Bellamy, followed the next year by an
explication of Bellamy's philosophy (Morgan 1944, 1945). <i>Nowhere Was Somewhere,</i> in which Morgan presented the "theory that [Sir Thomas] More's book [<i>Utopia</i>] in the main is not a fictitious story, but a record of a trip to Peru and
of what was observed there," has not fared nearly as well (Morgan 1946,
34). Critics have taken a rather negative view of Morgan's thesis; Bestor,
for example, labels it an "extreme subjective interpretation" (Bestor 1970,
293; see Filler 1954 for a more positive view).

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But <i>Nowhere Was Somewhere</i> covered far more ground than More's fantasy. Morgan's main goal was to
demonstrate the reciprocal influence of utopian ideas and historical
occurrences. Most of the book is skillfully argued, especially if one
accepts Morgan's definition of utopia as including "plans of government or
schemes for social improvement which present the possibilities of a good
society" (Morgan 1946, 3). Thus, the Constitution of the United States,
"offspring of utopias as it was, became itself a utopia to be taken, often
blindly and uncritically, as the fundamental law of many other nations"
(Morgan 1946, 8).</font>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan's hero Bellamy comes in for special attention. Constructing an
ideational genealogy, Morgan writes that <i>Looking Backward</i> "largely crystallized and gave form to liberal thinking in America. It
gave birth to the 'Nationalist' movement, the principles of which in turn
were fumblingly adopted by the Populist party.... [and] the Democratic
party took over Populist doctrines and further infected America with them"
(Morgan 1946, 9). Bellamy's novel is credited with significant influence on
Roosevelt's New Deal. Not only are there "striking parallels" between
Bellamy's book "and various important and detailed elements of New Deal
public policy," but Morgan declares "with considerable force that to
understand the long-range implications of the New Deal one must read <i>Looking Backward</i>" (ibid.). Morgan set out to follow a "great <i>pattern</i> of action" offered in the New Deal, a pattern based ultimately in a
transmutation of Bellamy's liberal and progressive ideas. Following the
pattern, Morgan the social engineer might make real the utopian
"possibilities of a good society" (4, 3).</font>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Tennessee Valley Authority</font></h3>


<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Legislation passed by Congress in May 1933 established the Tennessee Valley
Authority as an independent government agency and endowed it with broad
powers for the integrated development of the Tennessee River basin, an area
of forty-one thousand square miles with a population of three million. In
addition to taking over an existing dam and fertilizer plant at Muscle
Shoals, Alabama, the TVA, under the command of a three-man board of
directors, was to construct a series of dams along the river and its
tributaries. The dams would produce hydroelectric power, control flooding,
and improve navigation. Along with the generation and distribution of
electric power, the agency would build plants for the manufacture of
low-cost fertilizer. The TVA was to conduct economic and social surveys in
the region and promote the improvement of agriculture and the expansion of
industry. It was acknowledged to be a public works project of unprecedented
size and eventually led to the building and control of over thirty dams.</font>

had reservations about public service, because of the usual necessity for
following the dictates of political patronage, and that I did not want to
be associated with that process as I thought it had long-range harmful
effects on the course of government. He [Roosevelt] pounded his fist on the
table and said, "There is to be no politics in this!" I felt then that I
wanted the job. When he spent most of our time together talking not about
dams or electric power or fertilizer but about the quality of life of the
people of the Tennessee Valley, I was quite certain of it. (Morgan 1974, 7)</font>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">



<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As it turned out, under the direction of both Morgan and his successor as
chairman, David E. Lilienthal, employment at all levels of the TVA was
remarkably free of political patronage, although, as Morgan reported, there
was strong pressure by congressmen and some of Roosevelt's cabinet officers
to use TVA jobs as political rewards.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_no_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceding to Roosevelt's demands, Morgan chose an expert on southern
agriculture and "a man competent in power development" as the other two
directors (Morgan 1974, 7). H. A. Morgan (unrelated to A. E. Morgan), the
agriculturalist, known for his research in the problems of controlling the
cotton boll weevil, had been president of the University of Tennessee
(McCraw 1970, 12-16). For the third director, Morgan selected David E.
Lilienthal, a young lawyer who had served on the Wisconsin public utilities
commission and came with the high recommendation of Supreme Court Justice
Louis Brandeis (McCraw 1970, 18). In the first few months, Morgan made a
number of decisions on his own, leading H. A. Morgan to complain of some of
the chairman's pronouncements as decision-making by "official bull"
(quoted, McCraw 1970, 31). Only in August, at the suggestion of H. A.
Morgan, was a division of authority agreed upon: H. A. Morgan would plan
and supervise the agricultural aspects of the project, Lilienthal would
take charge of the electric power and legal aspects, and Arthur Morgan
would direct the construction of dams, social and economic planning, and
"integration of the parts of the program into a unified whole" (McCraw
1970, 32). Cordiality among the three directors seemed assured; only later
did a vast difference emerge in their respective visions of the
potentialities in the TVA.</font>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Arthur Morgan, the TVA "was to be nothing less than the culmination of
his life work, and for that reason it was a combination of what he had done
before" (Talbert 1987, 109). It was a chance to recapture and fulfill his
dream of a new moral and cultural order that had been disappointed at
Antioch. Near the end of his long life, he noted the similarity of the TVA
and his plans for a new kind of community, centered on Antioch College:</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->


<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size = "-1">
As I discussed the TVA with President Roosevelt, it seemed to me that for
twelve years in Yellow Springs I had been actively engaged in an
undertaking that was almost identical in spirit to the one he outlined. The
TVA seemed to offer a chance to create a new cultural environment, where
almost no field would be closed to a competent, able person. I was
surprised and pleased to find that Roosevelt had much the same outlook: he
wanted the country to loosen up and become conscious of a wide variety of
economic and cultural interests. He wanted a new breath of life. (Morgan
1974, 54)</font>
</p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to the demands of his rigorous moral standards, Morgan insisted that
there be no salary differential among the three directors and, in a gesture
quite unusual for government officials in that era, he made public
disclosure of his financial interests. But behavior based on an ethical
code for himself was not sufficient; one of his first actions as chairman,
as he rode the train from Washington back to Yellow Springs in July 1933,
was to sketch a list of ethical demands to apply to all TVA employees, "An
Ethical Code for the Staff of the Tennessee Valley Authority" (Talbert
1968, 110). Given Morgan's conviction that good results could flow only
from ethical measures, some examination of his code is important in
understanding his vision of the TVA.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining the New Deal as "the new social and economic order we are striving
for," Morgan saw the realization of this new order as fundamentally
educational, requiring "conscious deliberate effort" to bring about change
in "deep seated habits, social, economic, and personal." It was axiomatic
for him that "poor ethical habits are the chief preventive of a better
civilization," and "unless we realize that ethical attitude and conduct are
the very foundation of a new order, we will resent changes in habits and
attitudes, and our talk of a new social and economic order will be nothing
but talk" (quoted, Talbert 1968, 121-22). Among the items in his ethical
code, Morgan specified that employees should not accept gifts and favors
from those who might profit from making such offers; that the general
interest should take precedence over individual and particular interests;
that TVA affairs were in every respect to be conducted honestly and openly;
and that employees should take on their appropriate share of work in "a
spirit of friendliness and good will." Further, the TVA intended to
"develop a staff of men and women who are whole heartedly and
enthusiastically committed to the project of helping build a new social and
economic order," and those who showed "calculating, selfish ambition, or
habitual cheapness of conduct," even though such behavior was not illegal,
would be dismissed.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was another display of the Morgan authoritarian temper to which students
and faculty at Antioch had objected. As college president, Morgan had
published "A Moral Code" in 1926 which he thought should receive "universal
acceptance in principle, and will cover almost every circumstance of life."
It lacked the specificity of his TVA code, and following a statement on the
responsibility for maintaining good health, there was: "<i>Eugenics.</i> The best lives should be perpetuated." Aware of Morgan's paternalistic
attitude, says his biographer, we should not be surprised "that he included
eugenics in his moral code, and in that area he was to observe almost
literally that if the best lives should be perpetuated, the worst should be
terminated" (Talbert 1987, 57-58). To Morgan, most individuals were simply
not capable of developing their own ethical standards. The TVA code was
offered on the same grounds of universality; it would serve as "principles
that most well informed, intelligent, reasonable and well intentioned men
agree are desirable" (quoted, Talbert 1968, 123).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the code went too far, in the view of Morgan's co-directors, when it
required that employees lead exemplary private lives: "Tennessee Valley
Authority employees should maintain wholesome and self respecting standards
of personal conduct. Intemperance, lax sex morality, gambling, and the use
of habit forming drugs are not in keeping with the spirit of the Tennessee
Valley Authority personnel" (quoted, Talbert 1968, 126). Within a few
weeks, Drew Pearson's nationally syndicated newspaper column ridiculed
Morgan's TVA code, under which "every worker, from white collar executives
to ditch diggers, would be subjected to a searching questionnaire about his
private life and public views" (quoted, McCraw 1970, 48). Morgan was taken
aback by this public exposure; he had mentioned the code only to the other
two TVA directors, H. A. Morgan and David Lilienthal. The shot was just the
opening volley in what became a lengthy and frustrating battle between
Morgan and the other two.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Morgan, the spirit of the TVA program involved much more than the
behavior of its employees, and he spent a great deal of time and effort in
traveling through the region, making speeches and suggesting reforms.
Unlike H. A. Morgan, who cultivated allies among local leaders and used
existing institutions to sponsor agricultural innovation, Chairman Morgan
did not hesitate to throw out proposals that appeared at times strange. For
example, as one element in his crusade for economic invigoration, he spoke
in favor of the use of substitutes for the cash that was critically
lacking. Years later, answering criticism that he had irresponsibly called
for a separate monetary system for the Tennessee Valley, he declared that
what he had in mind was simply a system he had instituted in Yellow Springs
in the 1920s: "I suggested that individual small communities, or a few
working together, set up a local credit exchange, with exchange credit
coupons, to relieve this terrible economic paralysis" (Morgan 1974, 58).
Barter systems were widely used during the Depression period, but it was
odd to have a federal official publicly advocate barter in lieu of cash
exchange.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At other times, he showed a stunning lack of political acumen. In a
magazine article, he praised the people of the Tennessee Valley but wrote
that the region was "a laboratory." He promised to offer state legislation
to prevent the waste of good land. Under his proposed law, if land were
misused, it could be taken by the state and "either sold to some one who
will treat it properly or be planted as forest." He suggested further that
Tennessee could reduce the number of its counties to one-fourth the
existing number and "a large tax burden would be relieved" (quoted, McCraw
1970, 34-35). A reduction in business firms was also on his agenda.
Speaking to an audience of Knoxville businessmen, he bluntly stated: "In
most American cities there are at least four times as many merchants as are
necessary" (quoted, McCraw 1970, 35).</font>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">New Towns for the TVA</font></h3>


<!--_text_no_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
A major triumph in Morgan's push for the new order, a jewel in the crown of
TVA social engineering, was the creation of completely new towns. Housing
large numbers of workers needed for the massive construction projects was
an immediate problem. The directors, aware that temporary housing would be
much cheaper than the model village proposed by Morgan, were hesitant to
approve his plan. While the board considered it, the initial work force
lived in barracks or commuted to their jobs over twisting mountain roads.
Full approval was granted in July 1933, and Norris, Tennessee, so named by
Morgan to honor the senator who had been instrumental in the fight for
approval of the TVA, began to take shape. The town was to be the site for
demonstrating many of Morgan's ideas, a frankly experimental effort to set
an example for the nation of how life by proper ethical standards might
proceed.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_no_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norris incorporated many features of the greenbelt cities and its physical
design alone merited much of the national attention it received. Surrounded
by a 2,000-acre greenbelt, the town eventually contained over three hundred
family houses, a dormitory for unmarried workers, and the business
structures of an ordinary town of its size. Houses were completely
electrified, and each had a four-acre plot available outside town for
gardening. Compared to the ramshackle houses previously occupied by many of
the new residents, the simple but comfortable houses, with indoor plumbing
and electricity, were a considerable improvement. Rents were pegged at
about 25 percent of a worker's income, and the town's businesses operated
entirely on a nonprofit, cooperative plan.</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the school in Norris, however, that caught the attention of the
national press. "Of the numerous articles on the school, not one was in any
way negative, and most reporters observed that the building served as a
genuine community center, opening its doors in the evening for adult
education and offering its 580-seat auditorium for community events,
including church services and movies twice a week" (Talbert 1987, 118).
Classes were arranged on the Progressive model, with an effort to
incorporate real-life situations in the curriculum. The school's
organization, from its curricular emphasis on melding the practical and the
academic, including student development of businesses, to its stress on
eliminating all forms of competition, bore the mark of Morgan's educational
philosophy. Students operated a bank and made loans, ran the cafeteria and
school store, and sold insurance&#151;all as part of a cooperative. When
school was not in session, the building was available for adult classes.
With work organized into shifts of five and a half hours, a measure
designed to increase the number of jobs available, there was time for adult
classes in crafts, home economics, and, of course, ethical principles.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years later, in 1937, the town had come upon troubled times. Morgan
had planned for controlled industrial development to provide jobs, but the
relatively high wages paid by the TVA offered little incentive for new
industry in the area. Only the crowds of tourists who came to see the newly
finished Norris Dam brought sufficient trade to the town's businesses. With
the completion of the dam, the workers and their families moved on and the
model village quietly turned into a bedroom community for commuters to
Knoxville. After World War II, Norris, along with other TVA towns, was sold
to private investors.</font>

Morgan attempted a number of innovations in the region, including the
integration, with equal pay scales, of black and white workers. Aside from
his ethical code and the experiment in community-building at Norris, he
spread his vision of the new social and economic order in speeches and
writings that gained national audiences.</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by 1937 he was reaching the point of forced resignation from the TVA.
His interpretation of the TVA as the leading edge of a different social and
economic order had time and again led him into sharp disagreement with his
fellow directors, H. A. Morgan and Lilienthal. For his part, Arthur Morgan
declared that he was following what he and Roosevelt had agreed was the
spirit of the TVA. The heart of the conflict between himself and the other
two directors, as he wrote years later, was that "the other members of the
board held that no TVA development projects were legitimate unless they
were individually and specifically described in the TVA Act. On the other
hand, I was trying to implement the President's statement. Some of the most
relentless opposition of the board majority was to actions directly in line
with the President's specific illustrations to me of definite actions he
had in mind" (Morgan 1974, 154-55).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive differences existed among the directors on how to deal with the
private utility companies in the region. Lilienthal, a veteran of the
utility regulation battles in Wisconsin, held out for no compromise and no
negotiation with private utility bosses. Arthur Morgan took the position
that reasonable men should discuss the issue of furnishing electricity to
the public and find a solution to the potential for destructive competition
with private industry. He tried to establish discussion with Wendell
Wilkie, whose company, Commonwealth and Southern, furnished electric power
in much of the area.</font>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue had to do with a demand for damages by the owner of a marble
quarry which would be flooded by a TVA dam. The quarry owner wanted a
million dollars in compensation, although a survey by geologists and
engineers concluded that the marble was worthless. Lilienthal was in favor
of an out-of-court settlement, of probably less than a hundred thousand
dollars, but Morgan was adamant "that not one cent would they give for
something that is not worthwhile" (Creese 1990, 275). It was a difference
in which compromise was unlikely. Morgan took an absolutist position
against those who in his view were exploiters, a position that allied him
with such other New Dealers as Rexford Tugwell.</font>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charges of dishonesty and irresponsibility went from side to side in the
increasingly bitter dispute between Morgan and his fellow directors.
Matters came to a head in 1938, as Roosevelt's Democratic Party prepared
for a difficult election. Writing to the president in March 1937,
Lilienthal and H. A. Morgan claimed that Arthur Morgan was "actively
cooperating with Mr. Wendell Wilkie in such a manner as to prevent the
Board from carrying out its obligations to the President and Congress"
(quoted, Creese 1990, 275). They followed this in January 1938 with a
nine-page list of charges. It "is not permissible," they wrote, for Morgan
to make public attacks on their integrity in negotiating in the marble
quarry case, or to fail to carry out decisions made by the board, or to
"collaborate" with private utilities. As a majority of the board, "we
believe," they concluded, "that Mr. Morgan's methods are wrong because the
doctrine of 'rule or ruin' cannot exist alongside the doctrine of majority
rule and minority responsibility" (quoted, McCraw 1970, 98).</font>
</p>

<!--_/text_indent_-->



<!--_text_indent_-->
<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Morgan gave his side of the story in a long letter to Representative
Maury Maverick of Texas, a strong TVA supporter, in February 1938. The
marble quarry affair, he wrote, was "an effort at a deliberate, bare-faced
steal" and the entire board of directors knew it. Obviously referring to
Lilienthal but without mentioning a name, Morgan wrote: "There is a
practice of evasion, intrigue, and sharp strategy, with remarkable skill in
alibi and the habit of avoiding direct responsibility, which makes
Machiavelli seem open and candid. It took me a year or more of close
association to be convinced that the attitude of boyish open candor and
man-to-man directness was a mask for hard-boiled, selfish intrigue; so I am
not surprised that Congressmen do not quickly see the situation from a
distance" (quoted, McCraw 1970, 98). Morgan called for a congressional
investigation to clear up the situation and sent copies of the letter to
several other congressmen.</font>

<p align=left>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan's accusations of misbehavior became bolder and each new development
in the battle received front page coverage in all major newspapers. When a
claims commission found that the marble quarry claim was worthless, Morgan
told the press that the quarry case was "the kind of difficulty with which,
as chairman of the TVA board, I have been faced in the effort to maintain
good standards of public service." The "real difficulty," he said, was the
impediments to his "effort to secure honesty, openness, decency, and
fairness in government" (quoted, McCraw 1970, 99). In response Roosevelt
released the nine-page complaint sent him by H. A. Morgan and Lilienthal;
Morgan countered by publishing his letter to Maverick.</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now beset by growing congressional opposition to his New Deal programs and
wanting no further bad publicity, Roosevelt decided to hold a meeting in
his White House office on the various charges made by the directors. Morgan
at first refused to attend, telling Roosevelt he thought nothing would be
accomplished. (<i>New York Times</i> front page headline: "Morgan Defies Roosevelt!") Roosevelt responded with
an angry telegram: "Meeting Friday is not called as you say to reconcile
the differences between the board members but to enable me to get facts.
You have made from time to time general charges against the majority
members and they in turn have made counter charges against you. I want to
get all of you together to substantiate these general charges factually. It
is your duty as chairman and member of the authority to attend this
meeting. Please advise" (quoted, Talbert 1987, 187). The message prompted
Morgan's attendance, but he announced to the assembled news reporters just
before the meeting began in the presidential office: "I am an observer and
not a participant in this alleged process of fact finding" (quoted, Talbert
1987, 187).</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearings took three days, spread over two weeks, and Morgan maintained
an obstinate refusal to answer the president's demand for substantiation of
charges made against Lilienthal and H. A. Morgan. On the third day, Morgan
read from a prepared statement, concluding: "I cannot participate further
in these proceedings" (Talbert 1987, 192). Roosevelt found Morgan guilty of
failing to support serious and libelous charges against the other
directors, and he declared that the chairman had obstructed the work of the
TVA and was "guilty of insubordination and contumacy" in refusing to answer
questions from the president. Morgan had until the next day to either
withdraw his charges or to resign.</font>

conceived it, Talbert's summation goes on, the TVA "was another benchmark
on the road to Utopia. Nothing more. Not expecting success, he fought
simply to continue the tradition of Utopian experimentation. That was the
way he viewed his contribution.... It was part of the long-term effort to
remake human society, another seed planted by a seedman in a long line of

found time and energy to inaugurate the next in his series of experiments
in utopia: the formation of Celo Community in the western mountains of
North Carolina.</font>

Lucy Morgan's tribute to her husband includes an "epilogue" by Arthur Morgan, pages 101-9. Morgan labeled his father "a poor provider for his family" (Morgan 1957b, 7). In the view of Morgan's wife, "the family life seems to have been rather a starving one in regard to the affections as well as to physical nourishment" (L. Morgan 1928, 17). Leuba's admiring biography of Morgan gives this portrait of the parents, no doubt provided by Morgan himself: Morgan's mother "was thrifty, kindly, neat, conscientious, and committed to her religious beliefs and to the right as she saw it. She attended church regularly. Smoking, drinking, and carousing were anathema to her.... His father, on the other hand, was easy going, dilatory, tolerant, and lazy; he was fond of his cronies, and of sitting, reflecting, chatting, and occasionally drinking, much to the embarrassment of his family. He was a religious agnostic&#151;unreligious, but not anti-religious; he did not ordinarily attend church services. He was not neat or orderly. He made a precarious and only periodic living as a surveyor, sometimes filling in as a carpenter or as a laborer in the nearby railroad repair shop" (Leuba 1971, 22).

A further contribution to his rapid ascent to national recognition as educational reformer was Morgan's election in 1920 as the first president of the Progressive Education Association. The association's three vice-presidents were John Dewey, H. G. Wells, and Charles H. Henderson, the founder of an experimental school.

Note how similar are his ideas on democracy and community to those of John Dewey: "American democratic polity was developed out of genuine community life, that is, association in the local and small centres where industry was mainly agricultural and where production was carried on mainly with hand tools." For Dewey, it was the "pioneer conditions" of early America that "put a high premium upon personal work, skills, ingenuity, initiative and adaptibility, and upon neighborly sociability." Even closer to Morgan's insistence on the fundamental nature of the small community, "It seemed almost self-evident to Plato&#151;and to Rousseau later&#151;that a genuine state could hardly be larger than the number of persons capable of personal acquaintance with one another" (quoted, Aronowitz 1993, 72-73).

Admitting that a comparison between More's Utopia and Inca society is "fascinating," one commentator slyly notes the "practical difficulties" of Morgan's idea: before 1515 explorers must have either "turned Cape Horn, or plowed 1,600 miles through the Brazilian jungles to Lake Titicaca, and then 1,600 miles back. After which they must have told the story to More in Antwerp, but to nobody else in Europe. This is odd behavior indeed." One might ask further "if the problem to be solved is worth the weight of the explanation involved" (Adams 1975, 230).

"Since we had reduced the working day to only five and one-half hours to spread the labor opportunities, there was much time for social and training activities. We built a combined store and post office and also a gas station. Since the members of the construction force for building a dam were of many different religious denominations, which might not be the same as those of the later, permanent residents, we built a single structure to serve as a nondenominational community church. We prevented saloons, gambling houses, and houses of prostitution from springing up, as they frequently did at other outdoor construction jobs. With these favorable living conditions, we were able to secure higher-caliber employees" (Morgan 1974, 89).
