<Center><h2>Morgan le Fay</H2></center>
<b>alternative names:</b>Morgaine, Modron, Morgian, Morgan le Fee, Fata Morgana, 
<p>
<b>titles and positions:</b>The Orcades Queen, the Rheged Queen, Princess/Queen/Priestess
of Avalon, daughter of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall
<hr>
Commonly in the Matter of Britain she is Morgan, the daughter of Igraine and Gorlois, and 
therefore half-sister of Arthur.  She is often his mortal enemy because Arthur's father, 
Uther, killed her own father in battle over her mother.  She is 
frequently shown as conspiring against Arthur, but seducing him in his youth,
in order to give birth to the child Mordred, who will
ultimately destroy his father.  Usually diametrically opposed to Arthur and the shining
values of Camelot, she is portrayed as a force of evil and is the focus of much strife.

Apples, with nine sisters;  she could also change shape and fly with wings
<li><b>In Malory</b> sister to Arthur
<li><b>In Tennyson</b>
<li><b>In Bradshaw</b> she is called Morgause, the minion of the Dark, whereas Arthur 
fights for the Light.  She is married to Lot of the Orcades. Her children are Agravaine,
Gwalchmai and Medraut, and it is commonly known that Medraut is the child she had with 
Arthur;  Gwalchmai is also suspected of not being a son of Lot.
