<h4><a name="VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h4>
<p class="title">How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of
Gaul, chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.</p>
<p class="text1">THEN it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode
a-hunting into a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King
Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they
three were well horsed, and so they chased so fast that within a
while they three were then ten mile from their fellowship. And at
the last they chased so sore that they slew their horses underneath
them. Then were they all three on foot, and ever they saw the hart
afore them passing weary and enbushed. What will we do? said King
Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot, said King Uriens,
till we may meet with some lodging. Then were they ware of the hart
that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting on his throat,
and more other hounds came after. Then King Arthur blew the prise
and dight the hart.</p>
<p class="text1">Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a
great water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the
water, and the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands.
Then Arthur went to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly
creature therein. Sirs, said the king, come thence, and let us see
what is in this ship. So they went in all three, and found it
richly behanged with cloth of silk. By then it was dark night, and
there suddenly were about them an hundred torches set upon all the
sides of the ship boards, and it gave great light; and therewithal
there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted King Arthur on
their knees, and called him by his name, and said he was right
welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of the best. The
king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and his two
fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly
beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served
of all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had
great marvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one
supper. And so when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur
was led into a chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none,
and so was King Uriens served, and led into such another chamber,
and Sir Accolon was led into the third chamber passing richly and
well beseen; and so they were laid in their beds easily. And anon
they fell asleep, and slept marvellously sore all the night. And on
the morrow King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his wife&#8217;s
arms, Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he had great marvel, how he
came there, for on the even afore he was two days&#8217; journey
from Camelot. And when King Arthur awoke he found himself in a dark
prison, hearing about him many complaints of woful knights.</p>
<h4><a name="VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h4>
<p class="title">How Arthur took upon him to fight to be delivered
out of prison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in
prison.</p>
<p class="text1">WHAT are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. We be here
twenty knights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here
seven year, and some more and some less. For what cause? said
Arthur. We shall tell you, said the knights; this lord of this
castle, his name is Sir Damas, and he is the falsest knight that
liveth, and full of treason, and a very coward as any liveth, and
he hath a younger brother, a good knight of prowess, his name is
Sir Ontzlake; and this traitor Damas, the elder brother will give
him no part of his livelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake keepeth thorough
prowess of his hands, and so he keepeth from him a full fair manor
and a rich, and therein Sir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully, and is
well beloved of all people. And this Sir Damas, our master is as
evil beloved, for he is without mercy, and he is a coward, and
great war hath been betwixt them both, but Ontzlake hath ever the
better, and ever he proffereth Sir Damas to fight for the
livelihood, body for body, but he will not do; other-else to find a
knight to fight for him. Unto that Sir Damas had granted to find a
knight, but he is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never a
knight will fight for him. And when Damas saw this, that there was
never a knight would fight for him, he hath daily lain await with
many knights with him, and taken all the knights in this country to
see and espy their adventures, he hath taken them by force and
brought them to his prison. And so he took us separately as we rode
on our adventures, and many good knights have died in this prison
for hunger, to the number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all
that here is, or hath been, would have foughten with his brother
Ontzlake, he would have delivered us, but for because this Damas is
so false and so full of treason we would never fight for him to die
for it. And we be so lean for hunger that unnethe we may stand on
our feet. God deliver you, for his mercy, said Arthur.</p>
<p class="text1">Anon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked
him, What cheer? I cannot say, said he. Sir, said she, an ye will
fight for my lord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye
escape never the life. Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet had I
liefer to fight with a knight than to die in prison; with this,
said Arthur, I may be delivered and all these prisoners, I will do
the battle. Yes, said the damosel. I am ready, said Arthur, an I
had horse and armour. Ye shall lack none, said the damosel.
Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you in the court of Arthur.
Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am the lord&#8217;s
daughter of this castle. Yet was she false, for she was one of the
damosels of Morgan le Fay.</p>
<p class="text1">Anon she went unto Sir Damas, and told him how he would do
battle for him, and so he sent for Arthur. And when he came he was
well coloured, and well made of his limbs, that all knights that
saw him said it were pity that such a knight should die in prison.
So Sir Damas and he were agreed that he should fight for him upon
this covenant, that all other knights should be delivered; and unto
that was Sir Damas sworn unto Arthur, and also to do the battle to
the uttermost. And with that all the twenty knights were brought
out of the dark prison into the hall, and delivered, and so they
all abode to see the battle.</p>
<h4><a name="VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h4>
<p class="title">How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took
upon him to do battle against Arthur.</p>
<p class="text1">NOW turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found
himself by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of
death. And there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and
out of that pipe ran water all on high in a stone of marble. When
Sir Accolon saw this, he blessed him and said, Jesus save my lord
King Arthur, and King Uriens, for these damosels in this ship have
betrayed us, they were devils and no women; and if I may escape
this misadventure, I shall destroy all where I may find these false
damosels that use enchantments. Right with that there came a dwarf
with a great mouth and a flat nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and
said how he came from Queen Morgan le Fay, and she greeteth you
well, and biddeth you be of strong heart, for ye shall fight to
morrow with a knight at the hour of prime, and therefore she hath
sent you here Excalibur, Arthur&#8217;s sword, and the scabbard,
and she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to the
uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye
spake together in privity; and what damosel that bringeth her the
knight&#8217;s head, which ye shall fight withal, she will make her
a queen. Now I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that
I have promised her now I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen
Morgan le Fay? Right late, said the dwarf. Then Accolon took him in
his arms and said, Recommend me unto my lady queen, and tell her
all shall be done that I have promised her, and else I will die for
it. Now I suppose, said Accolon, she hath made all these crafts and
enchantments for this battle. Ye may well believe it, said the
dwarf. Right so there came a knight and a lady with six squires,
and saluted Accolon, and prayed him for to arise, and come and rest
him at his manor. And so Accolon mounted upon a void horse, and
went with the knight unto a fair manor by a priory, and there he
had passing good cheer.</p>
<p class="text1">Then Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make
him ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field
to fight with a good knight, for he had found a good knight that
was ready to do battle at all points. When this word came unto Sir
Ontzlake he was passing heavy, for he was wounded a little tofore
through both his thighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as
he was wounded, he would have taken the battle on hand. So it
happed at that time, by the means of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was
with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when he heard of that battle, and how
Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he would fight for him. Because
Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and the sheath for to fight
with the knight on the morn: this was the cause Sir Accolon took
the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing glad, and thanked
Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so much for him.
And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother Sir Damas,
that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the field by
the hour of prime.</p>
<p class="text1">So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked
Sir Damas, When shall we to the field? Sir, said Sir Damas, ye
shall hear mass. And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done
there came a squire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his
knight were ready, for our knight is ready in the field. Then Sir
Arthur mounted upon horseback, and there were all the knights and
commons of that country; and so by all advices there were chosen
twelve good men of the country for to wait upon the two knights.
And right as Arthur was on horseback there came a damosel from
Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a sword like unto
Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur, Morgan le Fay
sendeth here your sword for great love. And he thanked her, and
weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and the
scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</p>
<h4><a name="IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h4>
<p class="title">Of the battle between King Arthur and
Accolon.</p>
<p class="text1">AND then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let
their horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of
the shield with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to
the earth; and then they started up both, and pulled out their
swords. The meanwhile that they were thus at the battle, came the
Damosel of the Lake into the field, that put Merlin under the
stone; and she came thither for love of King Arthur, for she knew
how Morgan le Fay had so ordained that King Arthur should have been
slain that day, and therefore she came to save his life. And so
they went eagerly to the battle, and gave many great strokes, but
always Arthur&#8217;s sword bit not like Accolon&#8217;s sword; but
for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded sore
Arthur, that it was marvel he stood, and always his blood fell from
him fast.</p>
<p class="text1">When Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed,
and then he deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his
sword bit not steel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded him
sore to be dead, for ever him seemed that the sword in
Accolon&#8217;s hand was Excalibur, for at every stroke that
Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur. Now, knight, said Accolon
unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur answered not again,
and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made him to stoop,
nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir Accolon withdrew him a
little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur
such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were they wroth
both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur
lost so much blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but he
was so full of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And
Sir Accolon lost not a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing
light, and Sir Arthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have
died; but for all that he made countenance as though he might
endure, and held Accolon as short as he might. But Accolon was so
bold because of Excalibur that he waxed passing hardy. But all men
that beheld him said they saw never knight fight so well as Arthur
did considering the blood that he bled. So was all the people sorry
for him, but the two brethren would not accord. Then always they
fought together as fierce knights, and Sir Arthur withdrew him a
little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called him to battle and
said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest. And therewith he
came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth for the blood
that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the helm, so
mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and therewith
Arthur&#8217;s sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass
among the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his
hands. When Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but
always he held up his shield and lost no ground, nor bated no
cheer.</p>
