<table cellspacing=10><td>A three-member board directed  TVA: Arthur Morgan, Harcourt Morgan, and David Lilienthal. Each had very different ideas about the direction TVA could and should take. A battle between the three administrators went on from 1933 until March, 1938, when Arthur Morgan was fired  (See <a href="http://newdeal.feri.org/tva/tva03.htm#c">Cartoons</a> ).<p>

<blockquote><A HREF="http://newdeal.feri.org/bios/bio2.htm">Arthur Morgan</A>, the former president of Antioch College, was an advocate of  social planning who saw in  TVA an opportunity to build a cooperative relationship between government and business. He wanted to keep rates at a comparative level to avoid alienating private industry. Morgan believed the higher purpose of  TVA was to eliminate poverty in the Tennessee Valley, and to serve as a model for national regional planning. He had strongly-held anticapitalist, communitarian values, but was often accused of holding paternalistic and authoritarian positions.<p>

<A HREF="http://newdeal.feri.org/bios/bio3.htm">Harcourt Morgan</A>, the only Southerner on the board, was an advocate for  southern commercial farmers and was suspicious of experiments in government planning. <p>

<A HREF="http://newdeal.feri.org/bios/bio1.htm">David Lilienthal</A> was an outspoken advocate of public power, who wanted  TVA to compete directly with private power interests.<p></blockquote>

Harcourt Morgan and Lilienthal eventually formed a coalition on the Board against Arthur Morgan. This division led to public conflict between the board members, and in 1938 Roosevelt dismissed Arthur Morgan. <p>


In 1938 Harcourt Morgan became the new head of the Authority, followed in 1941 by Lilienthal. By 1941  TVA had become the largest producer of electrical power in the United States. <p>
