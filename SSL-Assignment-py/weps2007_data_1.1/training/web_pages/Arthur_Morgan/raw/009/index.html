        Visionary</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000066">Arthur 
        E. Morgan&#146;s farsighted vision and exacting discipline built a system 
        of dams and social management that changed the lives of millions of Valley 
        residents. But what he couldn&#146;t manage was human nature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Arthur E. Morgan 
        was one of the most influential Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, 
        and one of the most controversial. Perhaps he was also the one you&#146;d 
        be most likely to remember if you saw him in the street.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 6 foot 2, he was 
        as thin as Ichabod Crane; behind his black-rimmed spectacles his eyes 
        had an intense and critical look that gave him the aspect of a startled 
        predatory bird. Morgan caught people&#146;s attention, both with his appearance 
        and with his unusual ideas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When President Franklin 
        D. Roosevelt hired him in 1933 as the first Chairman of the TVA Board, 
        Morgan was famous for two things that might seem to have nothing to do 
        with each other: building efficient dams for flood control, and believing 
        in the perfectibility of humankind. In TVA he saw his chance to bring 
        the two together.</font></p>

              cast in concrete: the TVA dams.</font></div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A brilliant technical 
        manager, Morgan launched a string of dam-building projects that almost 
        always came in on time and under budget. But the dams, he believed, were 
        only part of a larger effort to transform life in the Tennessee Valley. 
        Morgan saw TVA as little less than a means of reinventing civilization. 
        He was to prove far more adept at technical engineering than at social 
        engineering. But to the extent that TVA was and is an ongoing visionary 
        experiment, the original impetus came from him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">He grew up in St. 
        Cloud, Minnesota, a small town beside the Mississippi River. He was the 
        child of parents of nearly opposite temperaments: an easygoing father 
        who was often absent because of his work as a surveyor, and a religiously 
        zealous mother. Morgan has been described as inheriting both his father&#146;s 
        scientific mind and his mother&#146;s moralistic heart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Unable to get into 
        college, he found work cutting timber in Colorado during the 1890s. He 
        was one unusual lumberjack. It&#146;s said that he quit a job when he 
        learned that the lumber he was producing was bound for a new gambling 
        saloon. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Returning to Minnesota, 
        Morgan helped out at his father&#146;s surveying concern. The work gave 
        him an education and an opportunity to solve engineering problems, especially 
        those concerned with drainage. By the time he was 30, he had earned a 
        reputation as one of the nation&#146;s best field engineers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Then came the devastating 
        Miami River flood of 1913, which killed more than 300 people in Ohio. 
        The state hired Morgan to prevent future disasters, and he did so with 
        comprehensive planning and the establishment of what he called a conservancy 
        district&#151;steps that went far beyond conventional flood-control methods. 
        He also tried to organize the dam-building workers into small communities, 
        putting up houses for them and offering them instruction in sound values. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus the dam engineer 
        who never went to college developed a second reputation as an educator. 
        In 1921, the struggling Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, hired 
        Morgan as its new president. Under his leadership the school blossomed, 
        pioneering a co-op plan in which the students combined work and study. 
        Morgan&#146;s goal was to produce philosopher-engineers energized by an 
        &#147;enlightened moral enthusiasm.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 1933, he was astonished 
        when President Roosevelt invited him to the White House and offered him 
        the chairmanship of TVA. &#147;I like your vision,&#148; said FDR. The 
        visionary set about launching this wholly new enterprise, doing much of 
        the practical work himself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Although Morgan 
        remained an idealist, his most evident contributions to TVA were literally 
        cast in concrete. As chief engineer, he headed the staff that built the 
        parts of TVA people could point to&#151;especially TVA&#146;s flagship 
        project, Norris Dam, and the dams that followed, including Wheeler and 
        Pickwick. His designers and engineers even built a model community at 
        Norris to house the workers who were building the dam. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> As general manager 
        of TVA, Morgan handled the finances, exhibiting his famous intolerance 
        for waste. He directed TVA&#146;s early educational programs, which included 
        a library service that brought books to isolated Valley communities and 
        a progressive high school in Norris.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">He directed TVA&#146;s 
        conservation efforts, its forestry and soil-erosion programs, the projects 
        that developed recreation areas and made Valley waterways more navigable. 
        He took charge of regional planning and social and economic organization. 
        To Morgan, comprehensive, large-scale planning was the single most compelling 
        aspect of TVA&#146;s mission. He was especially fascinated by Norris, 
        a community that exemplified his passion for planning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The task of integrating 
        TVA&#146;s diverse undertakings was another part of his job, and for him 
        it was one of the toughest. Often Morgan simply couldn&#146;t find a way 
        to integrate his own strong personality with those of his fellow Directors, 
        Harcourt Morgan (no relation) and David Lilienthal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Chairman Morgan and 
        Director Lilienthal clashed most often, and on issues as important as 
        how to distribute the power produced by TVA. Morgan proposed that TVA 
        enter into an agreement with the existing private utilities to distribute 
        electricity; Lilienthal argued that it would be better to let a network 
        of local public utilities handle the job. Ultimately Morgan just didn&#146;t 
        like Lilienthal, whom he considered a political opportunist. He asked 
        FDR not to reappoint the young Director. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 1936, their dispute 
        went public. Morgan eventually accused Lilienthal and others at TVA of 
        corruption and abuse of power. His charges prompted a long and complicated 
        congressional investigation. Asked in 1938 to substantiate the allegations, 
        he declined. President Roosevelt suggested that Morgan resign, but he 
        refused to do that. So the president fired him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Congress exonerated 
        Lilienthal, who went on to a highly successful tenure as TVA Chairman 
        during World War II. It might have seemed to many that Morgan, 60 years 
        old and with a history of medical problems, was at the end of his career.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But he was to live 
        for nearly four more decades, publishing a string of thoughtful books 
        on topics ranging from the ideas of Sir Thomas More to dam-building by 
        the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He released his last work, &#147;The 
        Making of TVA,&#148; in 1974, just a year before his death at age 97.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In it he documented 
        the creation of the dream he had done so much to shape, but had seen fulfilled 
        only by others.</font></p>
