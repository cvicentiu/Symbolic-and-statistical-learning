                      <font face="arial,helvetica">I first met Arthur Morgan when 
                      I was sixteen years old. He was speaking in Boston about 
                      Antioch College and his dream of a new and better kind of 
                      education. We being Unitarians, my mother took me in to 
                      hear him. I remember a tall, spare figure, raw-boned like 
                      Lincoln, with deep set, kindly eyes and intense seriousness. 
                      His voice was pleasant, his logic lucid and overwhelmingly 
                      persuasive, his points illuminated by homely illustrations 
                      from his own experience, which made his theories come alive. 
                      As we left the meeting, I felt as if I had seen a vision 
                      and was suffused with its light. I said to my mother, "I 
                      must go to Antioch!" <br>
                      <br>
                      </font></div>
                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">I applied 
                      the next day, and in due course there came an application 
                      form and a test to be taken. It was quite an unorthodox 
                      test. The College, it seemed, wanted to know not just what 
                      my I.Q. might be and how much I already knew, but it sought 
                      to plumb my attitudes, motivations, sense of purpose and 
                      social feeling. I must have passed, for the Fall of 1931 
                      found me in the entering Freshman class at Yellow Springs.

                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">I found 
                      Arthur Morgan very much at the heart of things at Antioch. 
                      His home was the center of innovative ideas and the source 
                      of a running dialogue of constructive self-criticism. Though 
                      busy with fund raising and a thousand administrative responsibilities, 
                      Morgan had time for any student who had come alive with 
                      one of his ideas and wanted to worry it a bit. He spoke 
                      often at College assembly, and his brief, terse published 
                      communications called "Antioch Notes" were thought provoking 
                      and life provoking.<br>
                      <br>
                      </font></div>
                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">When he 
                      was on campus he frequently went walking early on Sunday 
                      mornings in beautiful, thousand acre Glen Helen at the campus' 
                      edge. He let it be known that students would be welcome 
                      to walk with him. He carried the makings of breakfast in 
                      a knapsack on his back, and somewhere along the way would 
                      stop, build a fire and cook breakfast to undergird the discussion. 
                      It meant getting up early, around five thirty a.m., but 
                      I walked often with him. Sometimes there were just the two 
                      of us. </font></div>

                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">On these 
                      walks he noticed the growing things and their interaction 
                      with each other. He could tell you about the geological 
                      past of the area and point to where you would find abundant 
                      fossils of creatures that had lived there when the area 
                      was still under water. His ability to see the parallels 
                      was beautifully expressed in something he wrote later on 
                      about there being a place for small and big business within 
                      the total picture of America's economic life. Here is how 
                      he put it: </font></div>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">"My picture 
                        of American business is not of a choice between big business 
                        and little business, but of normal distribution, just 
                        as there is normal distribution between large and small 
                        in a primeval hardwood forest. Let that which is most 
                        effective if big remain big, that which is most effective 
                        if middle-sized remain middle-sized, and that which is 
                        most effective if small remain small; each respecting 
                        the functions of the other." </font></div>
                    </blockquote>
                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">In 1932, 
                      Dr. Morgan took a year's sabbatical, in the course of which 
                      he went to visit the Unitarians in Transylvania. He had 
                      been a Lay Leader of the Unitarian Church in the United 
                      States, and one of his Antioch students had married an idealistic, 
                      young Transylvanian Unitarian Minister, Francis Balazs. 
                      Balazs had returned from America and his studies here by 
                      way of Asia and, having visited Gandhi and Schweitzer, had 
                      finally gone to minister in a tiny vIllage in Transylvania 
                      called Meszko, where he tried to implement some of Arthur 
                      Morgan's ideas for community development. He had organized 
                      a cooperative movement and had revolutionized in many respects 
                      not only his own village but the entire valley. In a ministry 
                      of only five years, he wrote several books about the improvement 
                      of village life.<br>
                      <br>
                      </font></div>
                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">When Morgan 
                      arrived in Meszko in 1932, Francis Balazs lay mortally ill 
                      with tuberculosis, and his church work was being cared for 
                      by a theological student sent out from the seminary in Kolozsvar. 
                      The student's name was Vilma Szantho. She was the first 
                      woman ever to be admitted to theological school in that 
                      part of the world. Francis Balazs had been the first minister 
                      to invite a woman to preach in his church, and she was that 
                      woman. That is how Arthur E. Morgan knew both Vilma and 
                      me some six years before we ever met each other. The deepening 
                      friendship grew across the years into our marriage.<br>

                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica"> Arthur 
                      Morgan was born near Cincinnati, Ohio , but his family soon 
                      moved to St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he grew up. His father 
                      was an engineer, and his own interests leaned in that direction. 
                      Very early in his life he seems to have had a concern for 
                      social improvement for when he was just ten years old he 
                      was publishing great quotations for human uplift on a regular 
                      basis in one of the St. Cloud newspapers. In 1895, at the 
                      age of seventeen, he experienced a vivid vision of an ideal 
                      community while walking home through the woods. The Utopian 
                      dream of an ideal society was thereafter to direct his steps 
                      for the rest of his life. </font></div>

                      next three years doing many kinds of outdoor work, mostly 
                      in Colorado, finding that there was a real dearth of understanding 
                      of hydraulic engineering.Then he returned home, reading 
                      and studying problems relating to hydraulics, and began 
                      to practice engineering with his father, learning his profession 
                      in the old-fashioned way, from the ground up, by apprenticeship. 
                      Perhaps this is how he became committed to the alternating 
                      work-study method of education which he later introduced 
                      at Antioch. He married and had three children, Ernest, Griscom 
                      and Frances, each of whom would later have a distinguished 
                      career centered on some aspect of human service. </font></div>

                      the city of Dayton, Ohio, he was called to take full charge 
                      of the Miami River Flood Control Project, involving the 
                      building of several huge dams. This work he did so well 
                      as to be set on the road to worldwide engineering fame.

                      was appointed to the Board of Antioch College, a dying institution 
                      in Yellow Springs, Ohio, a moribund village some eighteen 
                      miles from Dayton. He saw Antioch and Yellow Springs as 
                      a kind of double opportunitv to test out his higher educational 
                      ideas and his concepts for community development. He was 
                      made President, and there began a thrilling experiment in 
                      innovative higher education. When I arrived at Antioch in 
                      1931, I found the strong emphasis was upon becoming a well 
                      rounded, whole man or woman dedicated to the welfare of 
                      humanity. To accomplish this there was a broad range of 
                      required courses, though attendance at them was not compulsory 
                      in accord with his emphasis upon self-discipline, but an 
                      art major, for example, was required to know something about 
                      the sciences; the science major to take courses in the humanities 
                      and to try his or her hand at the arts. Everyone was required 
                      to take courses in personal finance and budgeting, personal 
                      health and physical education. Spectator sports in the form 
                      of varsity athletics had been abolished by vote of the student 
                      body in favor of intramural sports in which everyone took 
                      part, and every dormitory hall developed its own personality 
                      and sports teams in place of fraternities or sororities. 
                      The college slogan inherited from Horace Mann, the first 
                      President, was, <i>Be ashamed to die until you have won 
                      some victory for humanity!</i>"<br>

                    <div align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica">In fifteen 
                      years Arthur Morgan built up Antioch College to where it 
                      was ranked among the top three colleges of the nation in 
                      a study by the Carnegie Corporation. Perhaps the most notable 
                      of his innovations was the work-study method in which students 
                      would study for ten weeks, and then go off campus to work 
                      on a job out in the real world. He believed that such an 
                      alternation would keep curriculum alive and help the student 
                      to apply and assimilate what he was learning in the classroom.</font></div>

                      called by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate and 
                      head the vast development project known as the Tennessee 
                      Valley Authority, at that time the greatest effort at regional 
                      development of natural resources and human beings ever attempted

                      met by Jim Farley with a long list of people to be employed. 
                      Arthur Morgan, with typical forthrightness, turned sharply 
                      about, took Farley by the arm and took him right back into 
                      the President's office, showed the President the list, and 
                      asked if he was or was not to have a free hand. Laughing 
                      the President took the list, and reassured him that he and 
                      no one else would make the decisions.<br>

                      is ironic that while Arthur Morgan was able to resist political 
                      corruption and corporate venality and to contend successfully 
                      with mighty natural forces, he was unable to cope with the 
                      intrigues, the contempt for his social ideals and policies, 
                      and the "dirty tricks," like the doctoring of minutes and 
                      misrepresentation of his views, on the part of one of his 
                      co-chairmen, David Lilienthal, and after six years he was 
                      removed from his post. Nonetheless, the basic character 
                      of TVA had been established and though his so-called visionary 
                      projects were discontinued under his successor, many of 
                      them were revived under later administrations. </font></div>
                    <p><font face="arial,helvetica">When Arthur Morgan came home 
                      to Yellow Springs after the TVA dismissal at the age of 
                      sixty, a crowd of a thousand persons had gathered at the 
                      station to say "welcome home! we love you! <br>
                      <br>
                      </font><font face="arial,helvetica">It was during this same 
                      period of intense preoccupation with the TVA and its victories 
                      and disappointments that he finished a lifelong work on 
                      a biography of the great Utopian of the nineteenth century, 
                      Edward Bellamy, and discovered connections between Utopian 
                      writings and actual ideal societies. This led to his landmark 
                      volume entitled, <i>Nowhere Was Somewhere</i>. <br>
                      <br>
                      </font><font face="arial,helvetica">Upon his return to Yellow 
                      Springs in 1939, Arthur Morgan turned his thought and energy 
                      to the problem of revitalizing America's small communities, 
                      the "Seedbed of Society" and the garden in which human character 
                      is grown. It was a return to an old love, for he had already 
                      built model villages in Ohio and Tennessee and sparked a 
                      successful "intentional" community in North Carolina. He 
                      had been the moving force transforming the village of Yellow 
                      Springs from a moribund littIe hamlet to an exciting and 
                      vibrant ideal community in which people wanted to live. 
                      He succeeded beyond his own modest hopes, and Yellow Springs 
                      today is a monument to his vision and idealism. </font></p>

                                of quality is accelerated. If our enemies had

                                America to an end, could they have been more effective?

                          to cultivate an appetite for inquiry; and to develop 
                          gradually a discriminating appraisal based on full recognition 
                          of realities. This attitude will develop humility, for 
                          the difficulty of the process will be realized.<br>
                          <br>

                          or trifling living or self-centeredness. The need of 
                          the world for the free spirit will impress him so deeply 
                          that all he is and he has will be committed to its advancement. 
                          As men come to realize this need they will not be &quot;tired 
                          liberals&quot; or men who sit softly in economic and 
                          social comfort. They will be campaigners and pioneers

                          to break men's bonds, not to exchange them for new ones.<br>
