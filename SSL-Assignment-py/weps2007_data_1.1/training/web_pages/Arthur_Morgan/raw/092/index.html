     <div class="entry_title">Morgan goes home</div>
   




  
     <P>The house had not changed all those years except it looked like the house was full of people and laughter something that never happened when Malcolm was alive. Morgan raised a hand to knock when a voice came from behind her</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Excuse me but is this where I can find Arthur?’&nbsp; Morgan turned, to be faced with a face of pure beauty. </P>
<P>‘I think so, ive been away for a while ‘ She stammered blushing slightly</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Me too I haven’t seen him since our school days. I hope im welcome. My names lance.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;He held out his hand to her </P>
<P>‘Morgan his half sister im not expected either’ They both laughed at each other. </P>
<P>‘Well Morgan if you don’t mind we’ll go in together it seems we are better going through the back as that’s where all the noise is coming from.’ He held out his hand and has she grabbed his arm she felt a sudden surge of electricity run through her body. Don’t be foolish what would he see in a pregnant woman.&nbsp;she told herself </P>
<P>As they moved into the back of the house the party became louder. Lance pushed open the gate and the party stopped to stare. </P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Morgan is that you?’&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur came towards her to embrace her acting as though Beltane had never happened, but he stopped and paled when his eyes fell to her stomach.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I hope i've not come at a bad time i’ve actually come to see mother is she here?’ </P>
<P>‘Yes she’s in the house. Help yourself’</P>
<P>&nbsp;She noted how his eyes couldn’t look at her but she didn’t really care all she wanted was to see her mother. She walked in to the house and caught a glimpse of Arthur and lance embracing as old friends did. She couldn’t help but feel envious she did not have friends or anyone in fact that she was close to. </P>
<P>Her mother was sitting talking to a pretty young girl. Both were deep in conversation until her mother looked up and gasped in surprise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Hello mother. I hope i’m not intruding’ Her mother got up and wrapped her arms around her </P>
<P>‘Not at all you should have called I would have had someone pick you up. Is vivianne with you?’ Her mother asked looking past her. </P>
<P>‘No she’s not i’ve come alone.’ She watched her mothers eyes move as Arthur’s done to her stomach and noted her mothers sudden curl of the lip which vanished as soon as appear. </P>
<P>‘So Morgan when did this happen? you should of told me I was to be a grandmother’ She said excitedly which Morgan knew was for the benefit for the girl who was sat looking curiously at her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Bel…. I mean I met someone in may mother but he went away as soon as and now i’ve come to spend some time with my mother if that’s ok.’ She said holding out her bags. </P>
<P>‘Yes yes child that’s fine your room is still as it is.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Both women fell silent not knowing what to say until the girl coughed. </P>
<P>‘Oh my dear i’m so sorry Morgan this is Gwen. Arthur’s fiancée you’ve just turned up at a little celebration.’ Morgan felt a sudden rush of jealously but didn’t understand why.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Hello Gwen, i’m sorry to have just barged in’ She held out her hand and to her surprise the girl gathered her up in a warm embrace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Don’t be silly any sister of Arthurs is a sister of mine.’ Morgan could not help but like her but there was still this tug of jealously that she could not shake off. </P>
<P>That night when the last guest had gone home. Morgan approached her mother. </P>
<P>‘You are disappointed in me?’ Her mother turned and motioned her to sit with her. </P>
<P>‘Today has been a happy day lets leave it at that. What’s done is done and can be soon fixed.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan looked at her mother puzzled what did she mean can soon be fixed</P>
<P>. ‘I met Merlin whilst I was at the coven.’ Morgan said trying to change the subject </P>
<P>‘Merlin!!! Nothing but a foolish old man with old ideas.’ Her mother hissed</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘He was the one who&nbsp;convinced me to come home’</P>
<P>&nbsp;She noted a smile form on her mothers face </P>
<P>‘Must off been one of his good days’ And with that she got up and left Morgan sitting alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;She sat looking out at the stars; the feeling of homesickness was starting to catch up with her. She had not realised how secluded her life had been inside the coven and how life had changed so much without her. She got up to go to her room and started when she saw Arthur’s’ shadow enter the garden. </P>
<P>‘Where’s mum?’ He asked </P>
<P>‘She’s gone to bed I think.’ Replied Morgan feeling uncomfortable being alone with him again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘May I?’ Morgan nodded as he sat down next to her. They both sat there silent not know what to say. but feeling questions floating like bees around their heads. </P>
<P>‘Can I just congratulate you on your engagement Gwen seems nice ‘ Morgan said breaking the silence first.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Yes she is her father was an old friend of the family you know the archbishop of Canterbury she’s his granddaughter. We are to be married in six weeks. ‘</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Six weeks! What’s the rush?’ </P>
<P>‘I’ve been involved in a new political party and i’m hoping to stand for parliament so the quicker the better.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan huffed in surprise </P>
<P>‘So you are marring for convenience I thought in this day in age you married through choice and love.’ </P>
<P>‘You!!! Talking about this day in age when you’ve been living the life in some coven learning medieval beliefs.’ Arthur threw back clearly annoyed at her mocking. </P>
<P>Morgan rose before her temper got the better of her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Morgan look i’m sorry please sit down.’ Arthur grabbed her hand. Morgan sat. </P>
<P>‘Why don’t you just ask me?’ she said finally.</P>
<P>&nbsp;He began to play with his hands a trait she remembered he used to do as a child and she felt her heart softening to him as he started to look like the lost little boy she knew.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I just need to know about the baby.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘What do you need to know?’ </P>
<P>‘Come on Morgan don’t play with me I need to know.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Well put it this way you were my first and my only. So what do you think?’ She watched the colour drain from his face as he sank into the chair. </P>
<P>‘Oh god what have we done?’ He mumbled </P>
<P>‘What on earth were you doing there in the first place; you know mother would not of agreed to you joining in pagan festivities.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;It was just one of those stupid things that a group of us suggested and you know what mother says about pagan girls. Never in all my life did I think of you being there. </P>
<P>Morgan felt mad at his prejudice but instead of showing him she put her arms round his shoulders and just sat holding each other trying to make some sense out of the madness. When she became aware of another presence. She turned to see the drained and disgusted look on her mothers face a face that looked like it had aged twenty years since earlier on in the day. Arthur shot up. </P>
<P>‘Mum how long have you been up?’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Long enough’. She whispered.’ Would someone tell me what’s going on here?’ </P>
<P>Morgan felt she no longer knew how to talk the words were refusing to unstuck from her dry throat </P>
<P>‘I was enquiring about the father of my future nephew.’ Arthur said going towards is mother to hug her. </P>
<P>‘Don’t you lie to me.’ She hissed. ‘I heard everything don’t take me for a fool. I heard.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘What did you hear?’ Arthur asked trying to sound as light hearted as possible. </P>
<P>‘You were her first and only. YOU were your sisters first and only and now she’s pregnant.’ She started to shriek. ‘Now tell me I misheard.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I think its best I go.’ Morgan offered</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘No you damn well wont.’ Gerna yelled. ‘I just cannot believe Ive been punished bringing two unworldly evil creatures into the world.’ And with that she ran in to the house followed by a slamming of a door. Morgan looked at Arthur helplessly but he turned and went in to the house leaving her with the feeling of dread and humiliation.</P><br>
