        Camelot Minus Chivalry, Legend and Soap -- By CHARLES McGRATH</strong><br>
        <br>
        JERRY BRUCKHEIMER'S &quot;King Arthur,&quot; which opens on Wednesday, 
        is billed as &quot;the untold true story that inspired the legend.&quot; 
        It's King Arthur, in other words, without all the Arthurian mythology. 
        Never mind that Jerry Zucker (of &quot;Airplane&quot; and &quot;Naked 
        Gun&quot; fame) has already made that movie &#8212; his 1995 film &quot;First 
        Knight,&quot; starring Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Richard Gere, which 
        dispensed with much of the Round Table back story and took most of the 
        edge out of the famous love triangle by turning Arthur (Mr. Connery) into 
        an older man and by not letting Lancelot and Guinevere get beyond a heavy 
        makeout session. Camelot in that version was a kind of medieval theme 
        resort, complete with light shows and an amusement park obstacle course. 
        </font><font size="2"> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The screenwriter 
          for &quot;King Arthur&quot; is David Franzoni, who was a co-writer and 
          co-producer of &quot;Gladiator&quot; and is currently working on a script 
          about Hannibal. He likes to prowl the library, clearly, and his aim 
          in this movie is to get back to historical roots. It's a praiseworthy 
          ambition (especially for Mr. Bruckheimer, whose &quot;Pirates of the 
          Caribbean&quot; was not exactly a model of historical accuracy), but 
          going back to the historical Arthur is a little like going back to the 
          historical Atlantis. Once you strip away all the legend, there's not 
          a whole lot left.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real Arthur, 
          if he existed at all, was a sixth-century warlord in the south of Britain 
          who rallied a few clans and repelled the Saxon invaders. He was like 
          a Dark Age Braveheart. There are traces of Arthur's origins in a distant 
          world of clans and clan warfare &#8212; the story's preoccupation with 
          magic and with incest (reflected not only in the incestuous pairings 
          that create the Arthurian dynasty but even in the characters' twinned, 
          nearly identical names: Uther and Arthur, Morgan and Mordred). But most 
          of the rest of the story &#8212; the knights, the Round Table, the chivalric 
          code, the quest for the Grail &#8212; is a medieval French overlay, 
          an outgrowth of the tradition of courtly love that developed at the 
          court of Eleanor of Aquitaine 500 years later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story of Lancelot 
          and Guinevere is the contribution of the 12th-century French poet Chr&eacute;tien 
          de Troyes, and the whole tradition comes down to us in English mainly 
          through &quot;Morte d'Arthur,&quot; by the 15th-century English writer 
          Thomas Malory, and through Malory's various redactors &#8212; Tennyson, 
          T. H. White (author of &quot;The Sword and the Stone&quot;) and ultimately 
          Lerner and Loewe, the creators of &quot;Camelot,&quot; which for us 
          has become the more or less official version (and one with yet another 
          scrim of added-on legend, this time from the Kennedy White House).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With each modern 
          retelling, starting with Tennyson, it's as if a little more mist gets 
          pumped into the tale and a little more of the sexual tension (the sense 
          of chivalric love as one prolonged moment of anticipation and frustration) 
          leaks away. You can understand why a filmmaker might want to go back 
          to the original material (even if it doesn't exist, really), because 
          the more the movies have pursued the mythic aspect of the story, the 
          more they seem to stumble.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dumbest King 
          Arthur film ever made (not counting the several botched versions of 
          Mark Twain's &quot;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;) 
          is the 1953 &quot;Knights of the Round Table,&quot; which starred Mel 
          Ferrer as Arthur, Ava Gardner as Guinevere and Robert Taylor as Lancelot. 
          The movie, which was MGM's first foray into CinemaScope, is often quite 
          pretty to look at, and has a kind of Pre-Raphaelite quality. The only 
          King Arthur flick to pay serious attention to the Holy Grail part of 
          the story, it ends with a religious vision. But there are entirely too 
          many scenes of guys clanking around in armor (the stuff must be welded 
          on, for it almost never comes off), and there is no chemistry at all 
          between Gardner and Taylor, who seems to have ridden in from another 
          part of the MGM lot, the one where they make westerns. In a movie where 
          everyone else speaks with some form of English accent and says &quot;thee&quot; 
          and &quot;thou&quot; a lot, Taylor talks like a cowpoke; his most intimate 
          relationship is with his horse, which in a Roy Rogers moment pulls him 
          out of quicksand near the end.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Boorman's 1981 
          version, &quot;Excalibur,&quot; is the muddiest and the smokiest of 
          the Arthur movies, and for at least half its length the one that most 
          convincingly suggests the real quality of life in the middle ages. The 
          jousts are not lavish, flag-draped pageants but slightly rinky-dink 
          affairs, such as you might see nowadays at one of those indoor jousting 
          halls where you get to eat dinner with your hands while watching aluminum-clad 
          actors gallop around. Camelot here is not a formal court but, rather, 
          a kind of improvised establishment full of necromancers, alchemists 
          and crackpots, and that too seems right. The only Arthurian movie that 
          does a better job with this fanatical, slightly nutty aspect of medieval 
          life is &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The movie version 
          most faithful to Malory, &quot;Excalibur&quot; tries to tell the whole 
          story &#8212; everything from Arthur's birth all the way through the 
          drought and Sir Perceval &#8212; and that ultimately proves to be its 
          downfall. The Lancelot-Guinevere story becomes just one more bead on 
          the lengthy string, and with the arrival of Mordred (Arthur's son) the 
          whole look of the movie changes, and it takes on a kind of druggy, sci-fi 
          quality that owes more to &quot;Star Wars&quot; and to Stanley Kubrick's 
          &quot;2001&quot; than to medieval legend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
          the new &quot;King Arthur,&quot; directed by Antoine Fuqua (&quot;Training 
          Day&quot;), proves to be exactly as promised &#8212; the un-King Arthurly 
          King Arthur. There is a Round Table, but nobody sits at it for long. 
          No jousts, no Grail and barely even the hint of a love triangle: Lancelot 
          (the Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd) darts a few looks at Guinevere (Keira 
          Knightley, from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;), but that's as 
          far as he gets; she's interested only in Arthur (Clive Owen). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A caption at the 
          beginning says that this version is based on new &quot;archaeological 
          evidence&quot; &#8212; though it's never clear what that is, unless 
          possibly a print of George Romero's hard-to-find 1981 movie &quot;Knightriders,&quot; 
          about a bunch of Arthurian-named bikers who joust on motorcycles. That 
          might explain why the Saxons in this movie all look like Hell's Angels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the rest, David 
          Franzoni seems to have relied on outtakes from his &quot;Gladiator&quot; 
          homework. The knights, despite those poetic names (Galahad, Gawain, 
          Tristan), turn out to be Sarmatians &#8212; which is to say, Russians 
          &#8212; who have been pressed into service with the Roman army occupying 
          Britain. They're led by Arthur, or Artorius Castus, to use his Latin 
          name, who is half Roman, half Briton and a closet Pelagian &#8212; which 
          means he is part Christian, part Stoic, and like the Russell Crowe character 
          in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; he gets to talk a lot about inner strength 
          and freedom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arthur and his men 
          rescue a Roman family from the Saxons encroaching from the north, and 
          then, when the Romans abandon the island, stay on to help the pagan, 
          war-painted Britons fight against the blond invaders. It's a sort of 
          Dark Ages &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; story &#8212; with the addition 
          of a Xena the Warrior Princess figure: Guinevere, who is not only an 
          excellent archer but is also apparently impervious to the elements. 
          In the dead of winter she fights in a kind of sleeveless nightgown, 
          and for the climactic battle she wears a revealing Thierry Mugler-style 
          S &amp; M outfit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buried in all this 
          invention there is a small but telling historical point &#8212; that 
          the Britain of the real King Arthur was, far from being a place of civilized 
          courts like Camelot, a primitive backwater, for a while an outpost of 
          Rome and then clawed over by warring tribes. Chivalry didn't come until 
          a long time later, and it was partly a myth, a cover-up meant to disguise 
          just how grubby and violent were the origins of all the feudal dynasties.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What people did 
          back in the Dark Ages was fight a lot, and in this, &quot;King Arthur&quot; 
          is entirely true to the historical record &#8212; except, that is, for 
          wheeling out crossbows and trebuchets long before they were invented. 
          &quot;King Arthur&quot; has the best battle scenes, the best hand-to-hand 
          combat, of any movie so far this summer &#8212; far better than the 
          stagy, self-important &quot;Troy,&quot; for example. It's not trying 
          to be an epic or make a grand statement. It's an action film, with just 
          a tiny hint of a brain, and a reminder, though you would never guess 
          this from all the remakes pouring out of Hollywood these days, that 
          movies are often better at making up new stories than at retelling the 
          old ones. In at least one respect it's also a little like its predecessor, 
          &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;: it creates a painless, very watchable 
          illusion of history without all the bother of the real thing.</font></p>
