<center>23.</center>
<p>
Guenevere woke up. She didn't know where she was or how she'd gotten there.
Meliagrant! That was it. Finding Lancelot - "Lancelot!"
<p>
"Here." 
<p>
Lancelot was at her head, at the head of the bed - no, the medical hoversled
she was on. With nothing but a sheet over her! "What happened?" 
<p>
Lancelot leaned over her and kissed her. "It's a long story ..."
<p>
<center>24.</center>
<p>
"Direct hit!" shouted Hemyson. "All three shots!"
<p>
Accolon couldn't help raising a fist in elation. He punched up a hail on his
signals board. "<i>Charyot</i> to <i>Excalibur</i>. This is Sir Accolon of
Gaul." The king would know whose service he was in without his saying; my
lady always named her ship <i>Charyot</i>. "Surrender and prepare to be
boarded."
<p>
"This is <i>Excalibur</i>," came the king's voice, audio signal only. "I
surrender <i>Excalibur</i> to you, Sir Accolon. You may board at will."
Accolon noted an anomaly in the signal readings; a wavelength shift as if
<i>Excalibur</i> was moving toward <i>Charyot</i> when navigation scannersoo
read that it was drifting free, quite a ways off from Carbonek, as it had
been drifiting even before the hits from <i>Charyot</i>. The anomaly was
probably just failure of <i>Charyot</i>'s signal compensators now that
<i>Charyot</i> was on the move; Accolon dismissed it. 
<p>
"Indeed," Accolon sent, and switched off. "Hemyson, you'll stay on
<i>Charyot</i>."
<p>
"You'll be outnumbered, my lord." Hemyson had gotten nervous the instant
Accolon had spoken of boarding. 
<p>
"That's why <i>only</i> you<i></i> will remain. Arthur has surrendered;
<i>Charyot</i>'s present complement," even less the handful on Carbonek,
"will be sufficient to take even so large an unresisting crew." 
<p>
<center>25.</center>
<p>
"Ahem," said Lancelot. 
<p>
Galahad, Bors, Elaine and Morgan were distributed around the station lab in
attitudes of varying degrees of patience; exactly as in a maternity ward
waiting room, Lancelot imagined, though he'd never had cause to use one
himself. They turned toward the door with comic simultaneity; even Morgan's
two knight guards looked up. 
<p>
"It worked," said Lancelot. But they could see that. Guenevere, cloaked in a
tunic Lancelot had found in a locker, was standing next to him. She advanced
on Morgan with hand out.
<p>
"What's this?" said Morgan. 
<p>
Guenevere halted in front of her, hand out to be shaken, ignored. "I'm trying
to thank you for saving my life." 
<p>
"What for? I had less to do with it than Galahad. Or Lancelot," she added
with a flicker of a smile and a glance to see his reaction. 
<p>
"That's false modesty," Galahad insisted. 
<p>
"It's malicious teasing," Bors explained to the pure knight. 
<p>
"You did something for me that you didn't have to do. Something fantastic,
and I want to acknowledge it," Guenevere persevered. 
<p>
"I'm also the only other woman who's slept with your husband." Odd that
Morgan should cite that as the largest difference between them, over all the
attempted revolution and regicide over the years. But it struck home with
Guenevere. <i>Women</i>, thought Lancelot, as Morgan continued: "You'll never
like me and I don't know why you're pretending." 
<p>
"I'm a doctor, and you just saved my life - you just proved that death is a
reversible condition!" For a moment Lancelot saw Guenevere's argument in the
<i>Excalibur</i> gym transmuted into wonder. "We ought to get along, dammit." 
<p>
"Nothing that has happened requires that we like each other. Surely you don't
think I did it for <i>you</i>." 
<p>
"That's true enough," Guenevere admitted. "I suppose you're right." 
<p>
"I always am." 
<p>
"Now you sound like Merlin." 
<p>
"There's no call for insult." 
<p>
"Hello, Lancelot, Guenevere," said Arthur, enterinmg the lab; and in the same
tone of greeting, "Morgan, you're under arrest for treason." There were a
handful of armored knights in his wake, Gawaine and Bedivere among them. 
<p>
Morgan raised her eyes and her palms to heaven. "No reward is worth this."
She didn't seem surprised that Arthur had shown up, but after a moment she
did notice with Lancelot that none of her knights were escorting Arthur, only
his own. Round Table knights on the station now greatly outnumbered hers.
Even as Lancelot realized, they were taking Morgan's two guards into custody
and leaving the lab to return Elaine's people to the station's functional
controls. And Bors was blocking door to her CAVE. "How did you get here?
What's happened to Accolon?"
<p>
"Accolon's on <i>Excalibur</i> by now," Arthur said. "He's got her all to
himself. There was no one on her but us few." 
<p>
"How did you boat off <i>Excalibur</i> without his spotting you?" Lancelot
asked. 
<p>
"A cloaking device, recently invented by Merlin." 
<p>
"<i>Excalibur</i>'s here?" Guenevere asked. 
<p>
"For the moment," said Arthur. 
<p>
<center>26.</center>
<p>
Accolon had had to cycle the <i>Excalibur</i> boat bay airlock remotely from
inside the <i>Charyot</i> boat, first having to wait for <i>Charyot</i>'s
decryptor to generate the appropriate signal code. He hadn't expected
Arthur's people to make it particularly easy for him. But neither had he
expected to meet such lack of resistance as empty corridors between the bay
and the bridge. And he certainly hadn't expected the bridge to be abandoned. 
<p>
There was an incoming flag on the signal board. Accolon activated it. 
<p>
It was Arthur, on video this time. "Carbonek to <i>Excalibur</i>. Come in." 
<p>
"This is Accolon. What kind of trickery is this?" 
<p>
"You ought to be more careful what you ask for. I had already abandoned the
<i>Excalibur</i> when she came under your fire." That explained the signal
anomaly - Arthur <i>had</i> been moving toward Carbonek, somehow undetected,
when he surrendered the <i>Excalibur</i>. 
<p>
"Sir!" called one of Accolon's knights. The systems ID grid under his hand
was dark and inactive. "The computer's locked out to us." 
<p>
"It's the same program Uther used in order to reserve the <i>Excalibur</i>
for my use after he died," Arthur signalled Accolon. "Your palmprint must
match exactly fifty percent of Uther's DNA to get back in. Of course I left
it responsive to my own voiceprint even so." 
<p>
"I don't believe it!" scoffed Accolon. "Why would Arthur Pendragon abandon
the ship that is his legacy, even with the computer locked out?" 
<p>
"Because I want Constantinople left wondering what happened to their ship,
and this is the only way to take her out so quickly that she won't even get
off a message."
<p>
"Constantinople? " Accolon was now thoroughly confused. "Romans?" 
<p>
"Romans!" cried the knight at <i>Excalibur</i>'s navigation board. "A war
eagle dropping out of hyperspace!" 
<p>
"Computer, this is King Arthur -" 
<p>
"Someone block that signal!" Accolon screamed to his men, hastily attempting
it himself. He'd figured out what Arthur was doing. 
<p>
"- Command: <i>rex erado</i>," Arthur finished. 
<p>
<center>27.</center>
<p>
"Arthur," Guenevere whispered, heard by Morgan and every silent person in the
room all facing the observation window. Their faces were washed in the white
and orange fiery glow of the destruction of the <i>Excalibur</i>, the
<i>Charyot</i>, and the war eagle by the <i>Excalibur</i>'s overloaded
hyperdrive engines. "Arthur, you couldn't." 
<p>
Arthur answered in a level voice, after a few moments. "I don't know what's
happening on this station," he replied, as the lightshow dwindled away on his
face, "but I wager I <i>had</i> to do that." 
<p>
"Arthur, the Holy Grail is on this station," Lancelot announced. 
<p>
"It brings people back to life!" said Guenevere. 
<p>
"It brought <i>her</i> back to life," Morgan said. Now wasn't the time to
bring up Lancelot's promise, but time enough to drill home its results as
groundwork.
<p>
"It's a process Galahad worked out," Lancelot interposed. 
<p>
"And my half-sister is after it," Arthur added. "That I could probably deal
with -"
<p>
"Granted. You're here," Morgan admitted. She had not been surprised to see
Arthur; one never got him separated from the other two for long. She had been
disappointed but not surprised that he had so quickly seized control of the
situation once he did arrive.
<p>
"- Have none of you stopped to think of the galactic political ramifications
of technology that restores life lost?"
<p>
"Well ..." said Lancelot. "My immediate concern was the queen ..." 
<p>
"It's not politics, it's science," said Morgan. That was prevarication, and
Arthur must know it was; she of all people knew how the one could be made a
tool of the other.
<p>
"<i>I've</i> only been back from the dead half an hour," Guenevere said
defensively. "Pardon me if I'm not up on current events." 
<p>
"But the Romans can't know it resurrects people," Galahad objected. "<i>I</i>
didn't know it could do that until Sir Lancelot brought the queen and asked
my lady and me to make the attempt." 
<p>
"The Romans must be interested in as much as you knew it <i>could</i> do,
same as Morgan," said Arthur.
<p>
"Its potential," Morgan agreed. She hefted one of the converted rocks. "I
certainly didn't go to all this trouble in order to become a sponge
merchant."
<p>
"How did you learn of the project?" Arthur asked her. 
<p>
"I have my methods." Morgan had science spies all through space and time,
trying to find projects that had died before making it into the history
books. It was how she'd learned of the cloning device when the archeological
party had unearthed it, for instance; one day she must hunt down its time of
origin. She didn't know how the Romans had learned of the project at
Carbonek; <i>her</i> spy had managed to acquire a junked Carbonek DWARV whose
memory had only been given a standard household wipe. 
<p>
Now it looked like there was a <i>reason</i> this project never made any
history books. Morgan was less surprised to see Arthur the more she thought
about it.
<p>
"And apparently the Romans have their methods," Arthur answered her. "Which
shall be little different from the Vikings' or the Saxons' or the Huns', or
anyone's. Before this, the Romans wanted it so badly they sent a war eagle on
a spy mission. Perhaps some Imperial intelligence boffin has guessed it could
be used for resurrection - intelligence boys are trained to think in
potentials. What'll it be like when <i>everyone</i> learns it <i>has</i>?
We'll be beset on all sides by immortality seekers."
<p>
"The storms in the channel void -" Bors started. 
<p>
"They'll go around," said Arthur. "For this, they'll go around. The Roman
did."
<p>
"Then let's share it!" Guenevere argued. She, Lancelot and Morgan had lined
up in front of Arthur, Morgan noticed. Morgan hoped he appreciated being the
villain for once. 
<p>
"Make resurrection a public institution?" Arthur said. "By what right may one
person say that another deserves to be returned to life? Or not? Who decides?
By what criteria? Who decides the criteria? Which of us has not wished to
return a loved one to life - and would all of those loved ones have been
grateful for it?"
<p>
"Are you saying," said Guenevere, shocked, "that you might not have allowed
them to revive me?"
<p>
"No, I'm not. I would have agreed if I were here," he said, giving his wife a
quick hug. "But I wonder whether it would have been a sound judgment. And I'm
trained to ignore my own temptations for the greater good of the kingdom -
how would the next person, the next emperor, the next tyrant react to the
same decision? This project has aspects of Pandora's box to it." 
<p>
"Well," Guenevere blustered, "you can't close Pandora's box." 
<p>
"Can't we?" said Arthur. 
<p>
<center>28.</center>
<p>
Lancelot tried to marshal arguments against Arthur's position. He didn't want
Galahad's project suppressed, but Arthur's points had force. Few knew better
than Arthur of the consequences of running afoul of those who would seek
power over others. 
<p>
But Arthur's mind wasn't standing still waiting for Lancelot's. "Morgan. What
would the Romans, or anyone else, have to acquire in order to reproduce this
work?"
<p>
"Well, the hardware and software here in the lab would be more than helpful,
but they'd <i>have</i> to have the willing cooperation of Galahad, and
specialists in the areas where I backstopped him."
<p>
"Why Galahad?" 
<p>
"As far as I know, his ability to work the Grail is unique, derived from his
close personal relationship with Jesus Christ." Despite Morgan's ironic tone,
Lancelot knew from her earlier comments that she meant what she said quite
literally. "And that seems, in part at least, to derive from his unique
heredity. Arthur - the Grail. Lancelot promised you'd reward me with anything
I asked. Don't destroy it. Don't think of it."
<p>
Arthur looked at her; then at Guenevere, then Lancelot. Lancelot could see
Arthur had deduced the entire story from Morgan's pithy comments. He met
Arthur's eyes only momentarily. What Lancelot had done for Guenevere had
properly been Arthur's to do. 
<p>
"There's a lot to think about here," Arthur said. "The Tree of Life -"
<p>
"Well, Arthur," said Morgan, "here's your chance to practice some of those
lofty Round Table ideals you preach. Or can it be that you don't trust the
Saxons or the Romans with the power of life?" 
<p>
Looking at Galahad, Arthur said, "I don't think I even trust myself with that
power. The Tree of Knowledge <i>and</i> the Tree of Life? But it doesn't seem
to be my decision to make." 
<p>
"No?" snapped Morgan. "I had the impression you were going to." 
<p>
"Why isn't it?" Guenevere asked. 
<p>
"Because the Grail itself isn't the essential ingredient here." 
<p>
Galahad looked back at Arthur a moment. Then he nodded, and took a test tube
out of an interior tunic pocket, and emptied the fluid from it into the
Grail. Lancelot recognized the solution from the Grail process - the solution
Galahad had characterized as a potent poison. 
<p>
"You can't ask him that!" Morgan objected, simultaneous with a shocked, "What
- No!" from Guenevere as she deduced what the liquid was. 
<p>
"I can't <i>command</i> this of another person, but I can and must
<i>ask</i>," Arthur said, almost without inflection. "It is my sworn duty to
keep the peace in Britain. And while this project is functional, Britain -
and probably the galaxy - shall not know peace."
<p>
But then Arthur turned to Guenevere, almost reluctantly. Not without
sympathy, he said, "There are, after all, some things Man was not meant to
know. I am sorry." 
<p>
Guenevere turned away, unable to respond, as Galahad moved off with the
Grail, praying. 
<p>
"But that's suicide," objected Morgan. 
<p>
"He knows," said Arthur. 
<p>
"You've missed the point, moron," Morgan snapped. 
<p>
"Suicide is a mortal sin," Lancelot belabored. "How can someone in a state of
grace - someone who can do no wrong - commit a mortal sin?" 
<p>
"Maybe he doesn't know," Bors spoke up. 
<p>
"Of course he knows," said Guenevere bitterly. "That's why he's doing it." 
<p>
But Lancelot knew that Bors knew doctrine better than he. "You're
suggesting," the first knight asked his cousin, "if he doesn't know that
doing this will kill him - if he believes something else will happen instead
- it isn't a mortal sin?" 
<p>
Bors nodded. "Mortal sin must encompass intent. If Galahad in his state of
grace can attempt what seems to be suicide, he must believe the result will
actually be something else."
<p>
"And if Galahad in his state of grace believes something," said Lancelot
slowly, "it's true."
<p>
"But what does he believe will happen?" Guenevere asked. 
<p>
Arthur shrugged. "Watch and see." 
<p>
Galahad continued praying silently during their discussion. Now he looked up,
nodded a goodbye to his parents and then, meeting Arthur's eyes, drank the
Grail solution off and set the cup aside. 
<p>
Lancelot wondered what the effects of the poison might be. The bright white
glow took him by surprise, and everyone else in the room. He had a hard time
keeping his eyes on Galahad, but somehow it didn't seem that it was physical
hardship from the brightness of the light that was making it difficult.
Lancelot could still see Galahad even for the light when he looked, but he
couldn't will himself to watch steadily. It was as if all the godliness of
Man, which Galahad believed in and personified, were somehow being
transformed into something the human eye could sense, but it was too
wonderful and terrible to look at. As if Galahad were turning into an angel
in front of them, and for the occasion Lancelot was being granted an angel's
superior breadth of vision, but he still had to rely on his mere human mind
to perceive what his enhanced sense of sight was telling him. 
<p>
Just as it became unbearable, it became bearable again. Galahad was moving
away. Or rather, up. "He's ascending directly into Heaven," Lancelot
murmured. The angel that had been Galahad when human rose through the room,
passed through the ceiling, and disappeared from their sight. 
<p>
Even Morgan remained still for many moments after Galahad was gone. Elaine
leaned against Lancelot, silent tears of mixed joy and grief on her face;
Guenevere, in Arthur's arms, didn't seem to take note or to mind if she did
take note. It was left to the king to get in the last word.
<p>
"Thanks," he said familiarly to the ceiling. Lancelot never knew whether he
was thanking Galahad for his sacrifice, no sacrifice; or thanking God for
vouchsafing them all this day of miracles, or for getting them through with
the kingdom safe. Then the king said, "Well - I suppose Bedivere had better
signal Astolat to lay on transport to Camelot."
<p>
<center>29.</center>
<p>
When Mordred saw that the visitor being escorted to his cell was Arthur, he
sprung from his seat and bore down on the bars. "Arthur! Tell them you
abdicated to me before you went gallivanting off to Carbonek. Tell them!" 
<p>
"I abdicated to Prince Mordred before I went gallivanting off to Carbonek,"
Arthur told the guards. 
<p>
"Tell them it's their <i>king</i> they've had locked up and charged with
treason for the past two days!" 
<p>
"It's your king," Arthur said obediently, "whom you've had locked up and
charged with treason for the past two days." 
<p>
"Tell them to let me out of - No, by God, I'll tell them! You! Let me out of
here! Yes, <i>you</i>! ... <i>Don't look at Arthur first!!</i>" 
<p>
The guard unlocked the cell. Still fuming, Mordred swept past Arthur
muttering, "Moron!" as he went by. 
<p>
"Where are you going?" said Arthur. 
<p>
Mordred halted. "The Kings' Council must ratify it if I'm to succeed you -
or, more politically likely given their prejudices, if I'm to be appointed
Prince Regent - and we both must be present in the council chamber for any
such ratification, mustn't we?"
<p>
"Yes," said Arthur. 
<p>
"You've already had them convene for that purpose, haven't you?" 
<p>
"Yes," said Arthur. 
<p>
"Then, what are <i>you</i> waiting for?" Mordred threw his hands up and
preceded Arthur and the escort to the council chamber, though he allowed
Arthur to pass him up, as was proper, before they reached any corridor where
they could be seen by others. 
<p>
There was a quorum already present, which Mordred suspected wouldn't have
happened if certain of them knew or even suspected what new business Arthur
was going to bring. There was a murmur of surprise to see Mordred following
Arthur to the podium.
<p>
"First, old business," said Arthur. "The commuting by Prince Mordred of the
sentence of Sir Gaheris under the charges of murder and treason is
confirmed." 
<p>
There was the expected uproar.
<p>
"Granted," Arthur continued, "what Prince Mordred did was treason ...
technically. In practice what he did was propagate the spirit of my realm by
willingly assuming the royal burden at necessity, though knowing the manner
of the assumption would inevitably bring him personal hardship for which he
nevertheless held no regard. My lords, I submit that Prince Mordred has
proved himself even more fit, in his selflessness, for this burden than my
lords have always considered myself, over my selfish protests and protests of
selfishness.
<p>
"Therefore, I move on to new business: I hereby confirm Prince Mordred's
allegation that I abdicated to him on the occasion of our most recent private
conversation."
<p>
After more uproar, and much of the diplomacy for which Mordred admired
Arthur, the vote went as Mordred had predicted: Mordred was sworn to as
Prince Regent. He was already plotting the transfer of power with Arthur as
the two of them left the council chamber. "I'd like Kay to stay on as
seneschal for a year. But he wouldn't do it for me."
<p>
"He'll stay on for six months if I ask," said Arthur. "After that, he'll stay
the other six months if you ask." 
<p>
"Fifty pounds?"
<p>
"Done. And congratulations." 
<p>
"For what?" 
<p>
"For figuring out how to survive execution for treason till I got back, when
you had such trouble figuring it out for Gaheris." 
<p>
"Well, it wasn't difficult. There were two differences between Gaheris' case
and mine. Justice was swift for Gaheris because he confessed so freely that
he'd done it. I on the other hand declined to confess." 
<p>
"Clever. And the other difference?" 
<p>
"There was no by God regent to judge me!!" 
<p>
<center>30.</center>
<p>
Arthur had left word for Lancelot and Guenevere to meet him first thing after
the council meeting on the observation deck of the palace's spaceport. The
meeting ran later than Arthur had anticipated; or else he had meant them to
have a moment alone.
<p>
"I made an oath to God," explained Lancelot. "I repented - all this. I can't
just go back to the same thing all over again." 
<p>
"Are you suggesting," said Guenevere, "that God meant for you to lure me back
into life with the love we have, and then for you to deny it to me?" 
<p>
"It was a test," Lancelot started to explain. 
<p>
"Like sacrificing Isaac was a test," Guenevere interrupted. "God is satisfied
to know that you <i>would</i>. But that's <i>all</i> He asks. He loves us
each for what we <i>are</i> - not for what anyone else, even Him, would have
us be."
<p>
"God works in mysterious ways," Lancelot fell back on cliche uncomfortably. 
<p>
"Mysterious, not warped," Guenevere rebutted. "The last time He put someone
through such a crooked test of character as you're proposing He's doing now,
Job passed it - and then told God off so well He's never since been seen to
take a direct hand in human affairs. Unless you count that business in the
Palestinian system as a direct hand. I suppose that depends whether you
believe the Trinity is really one being or three -" 
<p>
"What makes you such an expert in theology all of a sudden?" 
<p>
"A temporary state of grace, perhaps?" 
<p>
"There you two are," said Arthur upon entering the observation deck, though
it was he who was late. "Ready to see our new ship?" 
<p>
"New ship?" Lancelot asked, eager for the change of subject. "Already?" 
<p>
Arthur punched a code into a station computer terminal. "Now," he ordered it. 
<p>
From their vantage on the observation deck, the three knights saw one of the
station's drydocks begin opening its huge doors to space. Of course, no ship
left in British space since the events at Carbonek was big enough to
<i>fill</i> a Roman drydock. 
<p>
Inside the drydock was a ship that filled it.
<p>
It was the <i>Excalibur</i>. 
<p>
"But we saw her destroyed!" Guenevere objected. 
<p>
"Has neither of you stopped to think how odd it is to deny a fleet its
flagship at the beginning of a wargame tourney - unless it's finally gotten
too old and unfit for war?" Arthur waved at the ship in the dock. "Galescin
and the yards have been working on this for a year." 
<p>
"A complete replica?" Lancelot asked. 
<p>
"Everything we <i>can</i> still duplicate," said Arthur. "There are teleport
bays, with nothing but ballast in them. Gawaine's working on that, though.
He's diagrammed what circuits he could, and Sagramour is putting
technointelligence feelers into Roman space." 
<p>
"Arthur, this is astounding," said Lancelot. 
<p>
"It's just ready for trial runs," said Arthur. "There's enough of the day
left for an inspection and then once around the planet, I think. Come on,
it's time for everything to get back to normal." 
<p>
Guenevere poked Lancelot in the ribs as Arthur led them out of the
observation deck.
<p>
<center>31.</center>
<p>
"Arthur," said Guenevere impulsively, "there's something we've been keeping
from you."
<p>
It had been unspoken between the two lovers, since their impromptu, private
inspection of the queen's stateroom on the <i>Excalibur</i>-2, that they had
to finally come clean with Arthur. Of course part of what had been unspoken
about it was exactly how they would do it. On the bridge probably would not
have been Lancelot's first choice, or Guenevere's either. But she suddenly
felt the threshold of nerve she'd require. And, after all, the bridge
accoustics were designed so that the three senior officers while in their
station seats could speak privately if they kept their voices low.
<p>
Arthur smiled gently. "You think so?" he answered her. "Still?" 
<p>
"Can't we speak plainly, for once?" Lancelot pleaded. 
<p>
"I always speak plainly," said Arthur seriously. "And I tell you both: there
is nothing either or both of you could do that I should stop loving you.
Nothing."
<p>
<center>32.</center>
<p>
"Leave us," Arthur told the knights who'd escorted Morgan to the office in
<i>Excalibur</i> captain's stateroom that evening. They left her standing in
front of his desk. He waved her at a chair. 
<p>
Morgan ignored it. "Lancelot promised you'd reward me." By now Arthur
probably had viewed the logs he'd confiscated of the incident at Carbonek; he
might know she'd known Lancelot wasn't in his right mind when the agreement
was made. Now it might depend on whether the agreement suited Arthur's
purposes. 
<p>
Arthur leaned back in his seat. "You've been granted amnesty for all charges
and convictions-in-absentia of treason."
<p>
Morgan was truly surprised. "You're joking."
<p>
Arthur shrugged. "It's the custom to pardon all the treason cases left over
from the old reign when a new king takes the crown."
<p>
Arthur followed her train of thought on her face - something she had never
allowed before - and nodded confirmation when the incredulity on her face
showed she'd arrived at the only possible conclusion. "But -" She stammered
for coherence for some seconds, finally objecting, "The Council will never
accept it."
<p>
"Well, no, they haven't," Arthur admitted. "Technically I'm still high king
and Mordred's only regent. But they know my mind." 
<p>
During this speech Morgan had come back to herself. "Then my pardon isn't
your doing - I was pardoned by Mordred, your abdication or no. <i>Your</i>
debt still stands."
<p>
Arthur nodded. "I exchanged messages with King Pelles. Carbonek Station is
yours if you want it, as is. You can try to reproduce Galahad's work if you
like."
<p>
Morgan's eyes narrowed. "A free hand?" 
<p>
"Within the parameters of official royal ethical standards of course," said
Arthur blandly.
<p>
Morgan laughed. "'Royal ethical standards'! There had to be a catch. You
think I can't resist your offer, do you, even with the arbitrary restrictions
of authority. What makes you think I'll agree to that - or honor the
agreement if I do?" 
<p>
"You'll honor it if you agree," said Arthur, "because, barring the occasional
misrepresentation of identity, you've never lied to me. And you'll agree to
the restrictions of authority because the only person in the universe for
whom you <i>would</i> willingly agree <i>is</i> now that authority."
<p>
Morgan was perfectly still for a moment. She <i>had</i> been bluffing, but
she still didn't like being trapped - and she <i>was</i> trapped, as trapped
by her own nature as she had ever imagined Galahad to be. "Well, Arthur," she
said, "you've won. You've got everything you ever wanted."
<p>
Arthur sighed. "Morgan, all I ever wanted to do when they made me king was to
make everybody happy. Now are you going to be like Mordred and let me, or are
you going to be like Agravaine and defy me?"
<p>
As bitterly as they had ever fought, Arthur and Morgan really had never lied
to each other, so now she said, "I don't know how to be happy." 
<p>
Arthur stared at her for a moment, and then shivered. "I think that's the
most frightening thing I ever heard." 
<p>
Morgan smiled. "I suppose as long as I can still frighten you then the
universe will go on even so." But now she sat, casually, to appear
unthreatening. She wanted to get through this next bit frightening him as
little as possible. "Where is the queen?"
<p>
"Guenevere's retired to her own quarters for the night."
<p>
Letting a pun on <i>knight</i> pass, Morgan asked, "Alone?"
<p>
"As far as I know." One need not have known Arthur as well as Morgan did,
quite, to see the disingenuousness. 
<p>
"And when you retire - will you be alone?" 
<p>
"As far as I know," said Arthur again, this time with genuine ingenuousness.
<p>
"Arthur, I've realized since Lancelot made the offer that there's only one
boon I have ever wished of you." 
<p>
"Morgan, I <i>have</i> a queen. Besides, you're my sister." 
<p>
"That's not the boon I mean." 
<p>
In a moment the king had blushed like a schoolboy. "You're my sister,
Morgan," he repeated.
<p>
"This isn't about doing anything that makes you uncomfortable," Morgan
stressed. But half-sister or not, she was his first love, whose willing
reformation he'd finally contrived after all these years. Tomorrow she'd tell
him that it presented no conflict with the plans she'd been formulating since
Lancelot's promise. But did Arthur think she didn't know why he'd kept
trying? Did he think his queen and his best friend and his mentor didn't
know? But even Arthur wasn't immune to the simple human failing of denial. 
<p>
"It'd be incest." Listen, she'd conceded and he was still denying.
<p>
"Incest is just bad genetics. We won a crapshoot we threw in ignorance, and
we won't make that mistake again. In fact we couldn't if we wanted to. I
<i>am</i> seven years older than you are, you know."
<p>
"Incest is a sin."
<p>
Morgan leaned forward onto the desk between them and reached toward him. "God
gave us Mordred for this supposed 'sin'."
<p>
"I thought we won a crapshoot." 
<p>
"Same thing, isn't it? Sin is defined by intent. Galahad proved that -
Galahad who existed in a state of perfect grace all his life, which life was
brought about by, technically, a sin and was ended by, technically, a sin.
Yet you and I both know what intent conceived him, on all sides: love. That
is, Elaine's love for Lancelot, Lancelot's love for the woman he thought she
was, and Pelles's love for his daughter to arrange the deception. 
<p>
"Bors was set against Lancelot and Galahad cooperating with a 'witch' to
resurrect Guenevere, but he made himself stand by while it was done. He still
probably doesn't know <i>why</i> he did, but I do - his love for his cousin
and his nephew.
<p>
"Galahad and I had surprisingly little problem putting Guenevere's body back
together again, but - as I'm sure you know without being told - it was
Lancelot's love, and yours even if you weren't there, that persuaded her soul
back into it.
<p>
"And when you made Galahad see the possible consequences of all this, he did
what you told him because he loved all people even more than you do. And God
looked down on Galahad's decision, and He saw that it was good. 
<p>
"God's message through all this is clear to me, and it's the same thing Jesus
tried to tell us: <i>what genuinely proceeds from love is not sinful</i>. 
<p>
"You just said that all you want is to make everybody happy. You want your
friends to be happy. You want your enemies to be happy. Don't you get to be
happy too?" She held her open hands to him across his desk. 
<p>
Arthur sighed. "Well," he said, taking her hands, "I suppose, when you put it
that way, I can't argue any more without seeming a hypocrite." 
<p>
"Your enthusiasm underwhelms me. In any case I have no intention of going to
bed with you."
<p>
"You don't. You don't?" She could still confuse him too. 
<p>
"I have my reasons, which I'll make clear in my time. Which isn't to say you
and I haven't got a lot to catch up on," she added, squeezing his hands,
rising and pulling him toward the door to his suite. "How do you find
Mordred? What do you think of him?"
<p>
<center>33.</center>
<p>
Morgan saw Guenevere freeze when the queen discovered Arthur and his sister
already talking most domestically at the breakfast table in the captain's
stateroom. She wondered whether the queen would've begrudged Arthur his own
second lover (Guenevere didn't know yet that that wasn't the case), or
would've rejoiced for him that now <i>he</i> had someone to sleep with on
alternate nights. Or, given the queen's unabashedly emotional nature, both.
In any case, Morgan allowed her - and Lancelot when he showed - to squirm
awhile (Mordred also broke fast with them, but declined to squirm) before she
set their concerns to rest by way of announcing her own plans.
<p>
"I'm going to enter a nunnery," said Morgan. 
<p>
"You're going to <i>what</i>?" Guenevere and Lancelot both left bits of
half-masticated breakfast for the DWARV to clean out of the tablecloth later. 
<p>
"What have you done to my mother?" Mordred demanded of Arthur. 
<p>
"Nothing, recently." 
<p>
"Arthur and Pelles have given me Galahad's lab," explained Morgan. "I don't
need any technical training I haven't already got to operate the equipment.
But to work the Grail the way Galahad did, I'm going to have to become a
paragon of Christian virtue."
<p>
Behind Mordred's eyes he was trying to figure her angles. Arthur was
realizing that this was her motivation not to trespass on taboo the previous
evening. Lancelot's reaction was one of obviously enormous but tactfully
silent doubt. Only Guenevere could be relied on for tactlessness. "Piety
requires sincerity," observed the queen. "Can you do that?"
<p>
"I'm sure I can."
<p>
Guenevere snorted. "Pride's a sin." 
<p>
"I can conquer it," smiled Morgan. "I know I have a long way to go," she
added before Guenevere could snort again. "Perhaps I'll become the person the
Grail needs and perhaps I won't. Perhaps I'll find true inner peace and lose
my pride - and lose interest in the project. Perhaps you're right and I can't
change, and I'll look for another partner like Galahad or go on to some other
project. There's only one way to find out. All I know for sure is, the person
I am now must <i>try</i>."
<p>
"Well," Guenevere conceded grudgingly, "it has that twisted sort of Morgan le
Fey sense to it."
<p>
"Bors will be pleased," said Lancelot. 
<p>
But Arthur was shaking his head. Morgan asked, "You think I can't do it?" 
<p>
"The more I think about it," said Arthur, "the more I'm certain no one can do
it. The universe will contrive not to allow us. God gave us infallibility
incarnate to show us it could be done, and then infallibility agreed with me
that we're not ready for it." 
<p>
"What will it take for us to be ready for it?" Morgan asked. Arthur was far
from infallible, nor was he an expert theologian, but he had great intuition. 
<p>
"People have to realize that death has its proper place. Nothing, no one
lasts forever, and this is how it should be. In Paradise, Man chose to eat
from the Tree of Knowledge instead of the Tree of Life, and only in Paradise
may Man again find the Tree of Life."
<p>
"That depends on your definition of Paradise, doesn't it?" said Morgan. 
<p>
"Well," said Lancelot with faithful dogmatism, "Paradise is ... Paradise." 
<p>
"A lush garden where there's nothing to be done but loll around and eat and
sleep," said Morgan. "Who of you would be truly content with that?" 
<p>
"I might," Arthur said. 
<p>
"With nothing to read, no one to converse with, even yourself, if we
stipulate the Greeks' variant that all earthly memory is taken away? Or
there's the heaven the Vikings believe in, where one continually wars with
one's enemies for glory and honor in battle."
<p>
"Pass," said Guenevere vehemently, though Lancelot looked to his plate. 
<p>
"Then there's Jesus' assertion that 'the kingdom of heaven is within you'.
True enough for Galahad in a literal sense, but you lot are more
interdependent than that." The circle included Merlin and Nimue when they
visited this era, Morgan knew to frequent past adversity. It included Mordred
too now, apparently. He'd shown up for breakfast this morning just as a
matter of course. 
<p>
"All right," Arthur asked Morgan, "what then <i>would</i> be Paradise for
those of us here?" 
<p>
Morgan crossed her arms and regarded Arthur thoughtfully for a moment, and
said, "Somewhere - anywhere - that one is surrounded by one's loved ones and
by challenges of which none proves to be more than can be borne." Morgan
watched with palpable complacence as Guenevere and the men traded looks. 
<p>
"Thank you for the insight," said Lancelot, bowing to Morgan in his chair.
Guenevere didn't like that Morgan knew them so well. Mordred was proud and
envious of her that she did. Of course, in Arthur's mind, Morgan had already
become a part of their intimate circle, like Mordred, and in a way always had
been. So when Arthur reacted to Morgan's pronouncement with theatrical
glumness, she was moved by an unexpected camaraderie to play straight: 
<p>
"Something wrong?"
<p>
Arthur sighed. "If this is Paradise, what have I got to look forward to from
the afterlife?"
<p>
