<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="intro" --> <span class="commentary">Keep an
eye  on the sword Excalibur here: when Accolon (who is Morgan Le Fay's lover)
awakes after the strange dinner on board the ship, he is greeted by a strange
dwarf who gives him the sword Excalibur. Meanwhile, Arthur is also given a sword
that he thinks is Excalibur... These complications and confusions are all the
work of Morgan le Fay!</span> 
<hr align="left" width="300" size="1" noshade>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" --> 
<p class="reading"> <span class="reading">NOW turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that 
  when he awoke he found himself by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great 
  peril of death. And there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out 
  of that pipe ran water all on high in a stone of marble. </span></p>
<p class="reading"><span class="reading">When Sir Accolon saw 
    this, he blessed him and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King Uriens,
    for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were devils and no
    women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall destroy all where I
    may find these false damosels that use enchantments. </span></p>
<p class="reading"><a href="http://www.mythfolklore.net/3043mythfolklore/reading/arthur/images/dixon_dwarf.htm"><img src="dixon_dwarf_100.jpg" width="100" height="100" border="0" align="right"></a>Right 
  with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat nose, and saluted 
  Sir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen Morgan le Fay, and she greeteth 
  you well, and biddeth you be of strong heart, for ye shall fight to morrow with 
  a knight at the hour of prime, and therefore she hath sent you here Excalibur, 
  Arthur's sword, and the scabbard, and she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye 
  do the battle to the uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her 
  when ye spake together in <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=privity" target="_blank">privity</a>; and what damosel that bringeth her the knight's 
  head, which ye shall fight withal, she will make her a queen. </p>
<p class="reading">Now I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that 
  I have promised her now I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le 
  Fay? </p>
<p class="reading">Right late, said the dwarf. </p>
<p class="reading"><span class="reading"><a href="http://www.mythfolklore.net/3043mythfolklore/reading/arthur/images/beard_morgan.htm"><img src="beard_morgan_100.jpg" width="100" height="100" border="0" align="right"></a>Then
     Accolon took him in his arms and said, Recommend me unto my lady queen,
    and  tell her all shall be done that I have promised her, and else I will
    die for  it. </span><span class="reading">Now I suppose, said Accolon, she
    hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this battle. </span></p>
<p class="reading"><span class="reading">Ye may well believe it, said the dwarf. 
  </span></p>
<p class="reading"><span class="reading">Right so there came a knight and a lady with six 
    squires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him for to arise, and come and rest 
    him at his manor. And so Accolon mounted upon a void horse, and went with the 
    knight unto a fair manor by a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=priory" target="_blank">priory</a>, and there he had passing good cheer.</span></p>
<p class="reading"> Then Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade 
  make him ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight 
  with a good knight, for he had found a good knight that was ready to do battle 
  at all points. </p>
<p class="reading">When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was passing heavy,
  for he was wounded a little to-fore through both his thighs with a spear, and
  made great dole; but as he was wounded, he would have taken the battle on hand.  </p>
<p class="reading">So it happed at that time, by the means of Morgan le Fay,
  Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when he heard of that battle, and
  how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he would fight for him. Because Morgan
  le Fay had sent him Excalibur and the sheath for to fight with the knight on
  the morn: this was the cause Sir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir
  Ontzlake was passing glad, and thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that
  he would do so much for him. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his
  brother Sir Damas, that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the
  field by the hour of prime.</p>
<p class="reading"> So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked 
  Sir Damas, When shall we to the field? </p>
<p class="reading">Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear mass. </p>
<p class="reading">And so Arthur heard 
    a mass, and when mass was done there came a squire on a great horse, and
  asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready, for our knight is ready in the field.
  Then Sir Arthur mounted upon horseback, and there were all the knights and
  commons of that country; and so by all advices there were chosen twelve good
  men of the country for to wait upon the two knights. </p>
<p class="reading">And right as Arthur was on horse back there came a damosel 
  from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a sword like unto Excalibur, 
  and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur, Morgan le Fay sendeth here your sword 
  for great love. </p>
<p class="reading">And he thanked her, and weened it had been so, but she was
  false, for the sword and the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</p>
