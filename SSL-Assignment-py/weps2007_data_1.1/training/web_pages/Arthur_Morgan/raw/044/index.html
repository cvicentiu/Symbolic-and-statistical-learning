The Song Of Arthur - Chapter I - XI<br>
by S. Fowler Wright
<p>
<font size=+1 color="#22ddbb">Morgan Le Fay</font>
<p>
Merlin, of human birth and demon sire,<br>
Was therefore of delight and of desire<br>
Different from those of human parents twain.<br>
Never in damsel's arms his lust had lain;<br>
Never his heart for any maiden's kiss<br>
Had ached. But to another world than this<br>
He turned, and in the eyes of Nimue<br>
He sought the joys of common love to see.
<p>
She was his quest, and dark of hope, for she<br>
Avoided ever, and her wiles of night<br>
Were subtler than his wisdom, and her skill
Eluded his designing. Will to will<br>
They clashed in ways that never mortals know.
<p>
This strife, he could not gain nor yet forgo,<br>
Had issue that his prescience feared; and when<br>
Not all the wisdom that is veiled from men,<br>
Nor the deep lore of many an ancient pen,<br>
Could turn desire, and from that strife unwon<br>
He saw the danger that he would not shun,<br>
He sought the king, to whom he spake: "On me<br>
The shadow of disastrous night is near.<br>
Against an evil which I will not flee,<br>
No force is mine to strive, no craft to veer.<br>
Either beyond my hope my wiles avail,<br>
Or at the bitter price of life I fail.<br>
And therefore to thy throne, the while I live,<br>
Some counsels must I urge, some warnings give."
<p>
And answered Arthur: "If thy craft so well<br>
Can pierce the womb of things unshaped, and tell<br>
Their issuing substance, and the front they bear,<br>
Canst thou not guard thee from this fate, aware<br>
On what events its growth shall feed? For thee,<br>
Good friend to all my race, and most to me,<br>
I would not lose for half my realm. Thy care<br>
So oft hath saved us. What can lure, that so,<br>
The end foreseen, to chosen death you go?"
<p>
To which the seer: "The hazard of tourney strife<br>
Why take you, knowing that death may chance? I seek<br>
Mine own devoir, nor count the stake of life<br>
Too great a gage. But while the field is set,<br>
Ere joins the front, I would not first forget<br>
The friendship thine; and though my power were weak,<br>
Though live, to turn thee from the destined snare<br>
That waits thee on thy purposed path, would yet<br>
For that which comes your equal heart prepare.
<p>
"Bethink thee this, that though thy foes are thrown,<br>
Thy friends sustained, thy kingdom owns thy right,<br>
Thy strong allies are strengthened through thy throne,<br>
There is no day but darkness ends: no night<br>
But dawn shall cease. Nor hold I heaven so high<br>
But in the dust of time its pride shall lie.<br>
And though thy sun toward its noon ascend,<br>
It shall not at the last its night deny.<br>
All life that flowereth woos its hastened end,<br>
That recreate life another scene may try.
<p>
"Yet long shall stand thy peace, if care be thine<br>
That force nor guile shall wrest thy sword, nor take<br>
Its mystic sheath until the waiting lake<br>
Receive it at the last. But all I say,<br>
And all thy caution, is but vain to stay<br>
The fate foredoomed. For she that most you trust<br>
(As many yet you will, and some you must)<br>
Will steal it from thee."
<p>
With this warning said,<br>
That she should fool him first where first his trust<br>
Was stablished, from the precincts of the court<br>
He passed, and by the way that Nimue fled<br>
Followed, and passed the narrow seas, and sought<br>
Throughout the bounds of Benoic, till he found<br>
Where at the court of Ban awhile she stayed.
<p>
For well Elaine, Ban's constant queen, she knew,<br>
Whose babe at earlier need her hands had laid<br>
In that strange cradle where the waters sound<br>
Their song unceasing, and the winds around<br>
Mirage the shadowy lake from mortal view.
<p>
Here to the queen he spake, whose grief had way<br>
For Claudas' war upon her lord and land,<br>
To whom he counselled: "Let no weight of woe<br>
Distress thee, that thy life be hindered so<br>
From its full compass. Coming days to know<br>
Were oft to know how vain forebodings are.<br>
Regard thy son, whose lake-reflected star<br>
Shall gain the height of heaven. For Galahad - he<br>
Whom Lancelot of the Lake you fondly name,<br>
Since faery-dowered from Nimue's care he came -<br>
Doubt not that in his youthful strength shall lie<br>
The prowess that should twice such foes defy<br>
As ever restive on thy bounds shall be."
<p>
For when, long years before, the queen had fled<br>
From Claudas first, and in her mortal dread,<br>
Clasping her babe her weary arms within,<br>
Heard of the near pursuit the rising cry,<br>
Was one who crossed her path. That rout to see<br>
No fear was in the eyes of Nimue.
<p>
Hasteless she spake: "It were no boot to fly<br>
Pursuit so swift. But yield thy babe to me,<br>
And at the dawn of better days to be<br>
I will return him. Greater none than he<br>
Shall shine where Christian knights their strengths compare."
<p>
"Hast thou such sight the further days to see?"
<p>
"Believe ye that. The future's destined wear<br>
More than things present to mine eyes is bare."
<p>
So, in that need, his threatened life to save,<br>
The babe to Nimue's outstretched hands she gave;<br>
And in that instant all the path was clear,<br>
While those who followed saw a darkening mere<br>
Oppose their feet, that reins perforce thy drew,<br>
And whom they saw not could no more pursue.
<p>
But Nimue bore the babe the lake below,<br>
(If lake it were can never mortal know<br>
Or such mirage as sorcerous spells will cast<br>
On Afric's desert sands, as true men say;<br>
Yet seemed it so; and so for years to last.)<br>
There overhead the still lake-surface lay,<br>
Translucent to the change of night and day,<br>
But shadowed ever by the woods that grew<br>
Tall on the marge. Within that charmed retreat<br>
Not ever reached before by human feet,<br>
The babe she reared. Not ever winds they knew,<br>
Nor heat nor cold, but clothed in morning mist,<br>
Or shortly by the sun's high glory kist,<br>
Above them lay the waters, and around<br>
Were shining caverns where nor light nor sound<br>
Of earthly change invades; and tended here<br>
Was Lancelot, till the ever varying year<br>
Brought succour to King Bors, and brought to him<br>
Valour of youthful heart, and strength of limb,<br>
When Nimue sent him forth the world to know,<br>
Where all of life he met, exalt or low,<br>
And all that mortal thought will least esteem,<br>
Wore the strange habit of a wondrous dream.
<p>
Such was the youth of Lancelot. Who was she<br>
Who gave that rescue? Who was Nimue?
<p>
One was she with the life of lake and fell,<br>
Of torrents and great woods. Of such men tell<br>
Such proofless wonders as may none deny.<br>
Nor they themselves may rede the mystery<br>
That shrouds the hidden marvel of their birth.<br>
How know they surely if their natures be<br>
Or mortal or immortal? If they share<br>
Redemption with the race of middle earth?<br>
But wisdom holds that less of earth are they,<br>
The manifest spirit of Nature, to last with her,<br>
And with her passing doomed to pass away.
<p>
No mortal needs are theirs, and naught they own<br>
Of the mean needs required of mortal man,<br>
But are sufficient in themselves alone.<br>
Yet mortal loves are theirs; and haply woe<br>
Deeper than aught the hearts of mortals know.
<p>
Such was the one whom Merlin sought: to whom<br>
(The demon offspring of a mortal womb)<br>
No mortal woman could full comfort be.<br>
And called he for his aid, nor called in vain,<br>
Discarnates that the lightless deeps contain.<br>
From demon-birth derived such powers he led,<br>
Such snares against her carnal peace he spread,<br>
That scarce the holiest sign had saved; but she,<br>
Being more than mortal, and than mortal less,<br>
Dissolved them to light air in swift redress.
<p>
For this hard joust the final lists were set<br>
When Nimue at the Benoic court he met<br>
And half in pleading wise, and half in threat,<br>
He urged her yielding: "Were we joined," he said,<br>
"As Heaven belike designed, and best should be,<br>
Such powers were ours that all around we see<br>
Should be transmuted by our empery,<br>
As when the shadowy mists of midnight born<br>
Shrink backward from the red release of dawn.
<p>
"Art thou not more than mortal? Am not I<br>
Of might to foil the dooms by which men die?<br>
What were we joined? Ourselves we could not say.<br>
But partly may forecast how much we may.
<p>
"Yet think ye, while our separate strengths contend<br>
Alike we lose; and to what likely end?<br>
Thy wisdom, though from Earth's creation gained,<br>
How slight to mine! And thine eluding skill<br>
To mock me with thy transient wraith how frail,<br>
If all the strong fiend-powers that wait my will<br>
I called to aid! Should vaporous wiles avail<br>
If strengths foundationed in the depths of Hell<br>
Contained thy ways? Should any refuge show<br>
In earth's recess, or any power dispel<br>
Such leagues drawn? And if my wars delay<br>
Their last assault, you may not hope that so<br>
Of parley in the doubt of power they tell.<br>
But I would win thee in the gentler way,<br>
Unviolenced, wilful in the like require.
<p>
For, wert thou mortal, had I not to thee<br>
Come with invisible form and unfelt hand,<br>
And foot that left no footprint on the sand,<br>
Exploring all thy beauty, though thy heart<br>
Believed itself alone, and thought apart?<br>
Had I not known thy purpose ere thy thought<br>
Its fashioned meaning to thyself had wrought?<br>
Who couldst thy every close intent observe,<br>
And conquer wholly whom I sue to serve?"
<p>
And Nimue answered: "Great thy boasts that scale<br>
Such heights that there mine airier arts should fail.<br>
I do not doubt thee wholly. Yet to yield<br>
To that I know not, in such vaunts concealed,<br>
Were wealth to barter for a proofless prize.<br>
Saw I this power in such stupendous spell<br>
As only genders from the fiends of Hell,<br>
I then might meet thee in a different wise."
<p>
"Were we but one, I were not loth to show<br>
The sudden wonders of the world I know;<br>
But spells stupendous are not rashly wrought.<br>
Beyond the world they reach, beyond the thought,<br>
To no controlful end. But that I may<br>
To gain thee will I grant."
<p>
"I ask thee naught<br>
To change events from Heaven's destined way,"<br>
She answered, lifting eyes whose quiet grey<br>
Turned the last warning of his wits away.<br>
"But if at last beyond my heart I yield,<br>
What marvel wrought, or secret charm revealed,<br>
Shall be the sign by which the bond is sealed?"
<p>
And Merlin, "Choose thy will."
<p>
"The charm," she said,<br>
"The charm that none may name, the charm of dread,<br>
That holds him from pursuit who has not fled."
<p>
"Why ask you that for which no need could be?"
<p>
"For I would wit these wondrous things," said she.
<p>
"They are but words," he said, "yet hold the power<br>
To separate wholly from the changeful hour<br>
That which they name, which after holds its place<br>
In that which is, and yet which is not, space.<br>
It is, but is not, death. And only he<br>
Who spake the word can change that destiny."<br>
The words he told.
<p>
"Their sound is dark," said she.<br>
"And could this binding spell be wrought on me?"
<p>
"I know not surely, but suppose it so."
<p>
"That which I fear I ever would to know."
<p>
Swiftly she spake, and Merlin named; and he<br>
Was there, but was not.
<p>
"I'll thy jest," he said.<br>
"The words reversed will be the words unsaid."
<p>
"Then not by me, whose freedom is thy thrall."
<p>
"Alas, that simply in the snare I fall!<br>
Hast thou no ruth?"
<p>
"Doth mercy bed with fear?<br>
I prayed thee leave me, but you would not hear."
<p>
"Release me, and I will be ruled by thee."
<p>
"Content thee as thou art. It will not be."
<p>
"Power have I yet to use, who first implore."
<p>
"Thou art not here. I dread thy spells no more."
<p>
Thus from the void the voice of Merlin cried,<br>
Pleading a hundred ways, and all denied.<br>
Until she left him, in that weird to dwell<br>
Till she relent, or else till Heaven and Hell<br>
All Earth succeed, and all things fail beside.
<p>
II<br>
King Arthur moved from Camelot to Carlisle,<br>
Disturbed by rumours of unrest that grew<br>
In the far north. For while that peace he knew<br>
On southern plains, his mountained foes the while,<br>
Those of North Gales and of the Longtainse Isle,<br>
And Ireland, and Surluse, with Denmark's king.<br>
Made a strong league; and such bold furnishing<br>
Of mounted men and all the stores of war<br>
Valour and hate and lust of plunder made,<br>
As powerless to repulse Northumbria saw.<br>
<p>
Ravening fair vales the rapine southward spread,<br>
And Arthur, roused to wrath incontinent,<br>
For Pellinor's aid an urgent signal sent,<br>
Yet stayed not for his strength, but lightly led<br>
Such knights as could his sudden haste array,<br>
And turned from prudent words deaf ears away.
<p>
Nor went he single, for his recent bride,<br>
Urged of high heart, that not his love denied,<br>
But thanked it rather, rode her lord beside.<br>
"Strength shall be in the joyous thought," said he,<br>
"That here thou ridest, not at jeopardy,<br>
But that thine eyes shall own my victory.<br>
For in thy presence could I fail or flee?"
<p>
This the five kings were told, and one was there<br>
Who counselled wisely: "Every passing hour<br>
Brings him new succour and augments his power.<br>
Valour and caution oft one cup will share.<br>
Strike quickly, while the half his knights delay,<br>
Strike hard, with all the gathered strength ye may.<br>
Break ye by night, in sudden swift surprise<br>
Where on the north of Humber's stream he lies.<br>
Caught the deep flood and all our host between,<br>
You gain a dead king and captived queen."
<p>
Hard marched they then by privy ways, that so<br>
Their camp was made in thickets dense and low<br>
Nearer to Arthur than he deemed, and there<br>
They waited for the moonless dark.
<p>
Aware<br>
Of vague disquiet which were ease to share,<br>
Gawain, who shared with Griflet and with Kay<br>
To guard the king's pavilion through the night,<br>
Where in midhost beside his queen he lay,<br>
Rose restless: "Do we keep our trust aright<br>
Unarmed to lie?"
<p>
But answered Griflet: "Nay,<br>
Their vanguard camps a five hours' march away<br>
Our scouts have told, and swollen streams between<br>
Their path would hinder though that path were seen<br>
In daylight hours. With morn our camp we break<br>
Themselves to seek." But even while he spake,<br>
Through the still night the rending trumpet cried,<br>
Clamorous, and ere one urgent note had died,<br>
Loose, in full tide of tempest, broke the foe.
<p>
What rank? What rule? For separate lives they strove,<br>
Haply content for one good stroke that clove<br>
The slayer the while they fell. From out his tent<br>
Came the roused king, and called his arms, and though<br>
Were round him darkness and confusion dire,<br>
His aspect and his voice were confident.<br>
And though to all alert, of all aware,<br>
He made its threat the less, till leapt in fire<br>
The tented camp, and in the widening glare<br>
A wounded knight fought toward him, crying the while:<br>
"Lord, save thee! Closer toward thy tent they slay.<br>
Thy flight alone their final aim may fail.<br>
Bethink thine hostaged queen. Can aught prevail<br>
But larger loss if longer here ye stay?"
<p>
Loth turned the king. With Gawain, Griflet, Kay<br>
Guarding the queen, their hasty course he led<br>
Where deep and downward through close boughs there fell<br>
A path that reached the river; and haltered there<br>
A barge that strained against the rising tide.<br>
The black wave lapped along its seaward side<br>
Menacing, it leapt in larger wrath the where<br>
The wind was on the water. Frail and low<br>
Seemed the slight barge the sheltered bank to leave<br>
Yet with light laughter stept the queen therein.<br>
"For simple choice I take, to drown or win,<br>
Rather than hands of savage foes to know,<br>
To feel their slaughter, or their scorned reprieve."
<p>
Yet Arthur paused to give the word to cast<br>
The mooring loose. He had no mood to flee;<br>
And that black tempest of relentless sea<br>
Gave little surance that the barge would last<br>
Beyond the bank's high shelter. "Sirs," he said<br>
"When blindly in the night confusions spread,<br>
Worse may be thought than that the light would show."
<p>
"Nay," said Sir Griflet, "but yourselves to flee<br>
Were most to foil them. For yourselves would be<br>
Their largest profit."
<p>
"Yet I would not go<br>
While others strive. Nor that my queen should dare<br>
The waves' high peril which I should not share."
<p>
Then stilled debate, for voices on the road<br>
Above them louder grew, and horsemen showed<br>
High-speared and dark against a lighter sky<br>
Conscious of dawn's approach. They well might know<br>
That the five kings were they; their words so high<br>
Sounded, dispitious of a broken foe.
<p>
"Here," said Sir Kay, "our better chance appears,<br>
To meet them boldly with our single spears,<br>
And, ere support can reach, to overthrow."
<p>
Said Gawain: "Five are they, and four are we.<br>
Is that good odds? Should Arthur stake his crown<br>
On how a lance break, or a horse go down?"
<p>
"Yes," said Sir Griflet. "Lie we close."
<p>
But Kay:<br>
"These are but kings; not champion knights are they.<br>
Five say you? Let me meet the earlier two.<br>
Not odds but equals shall be left to you."
<p>
Boldly he spake, as one whose later fame<br>
Would likely rise to leave a loftier name<br>
Than his at last should be, when grosser girth<br>
Made sluggish blood, and noble deeds forbid.<br>
But now his valours as his words were worth,<br>
And that he boldly spake he boldly did.
<p>
His sudden charge the wareless group amid<br>
Bore to the ground North Gales' twice-perjured king,<br>
And near behind his ready comrades came,<br>
And each bore one proud king to earth the same,<br>
While he the fifth so hard on helm down-smit<br>
That through the skull the blade unhindered bit.<br>
There was swift end to that full conquering.
<p>
Back to his queen went Arthur. Who but Kay<br>
Was praised by him, and praised the more by her?<br>
If greatest were he called would none demur,<br>
Nor would he doubt it.
<p>
With the opening day<br>
The tide had turned. A slackening wind forebore<br>
To drive the breakers on the Humber shore.<br>
The further bank a closer prospect lay<br>
Than in the darkness had they feared. To guess<br>
Were hard how far apart their friends might flee,<br>
How numerous might their foes around them be.
<p>
"Go," Arthur said, "in Griflet's care, and I<br>
Will seek my comrades."
<p>
Gawain made reply,<br>
Not craven, but of cautious prudence bred.<br>
"Nay, for we know not how they stand," he said.<br>
"But surely may we look more foes to see.<br>
For in short time that here alone we be<br>
Their flying squires will tell. To safety now<br>
The barge will take ye, till with Pellinor's power<br>
New ranks are ranged to face a fairer hour."
<p>
But Arthur answered: "Would ye have me so<br>
To Pellinor sue? A king of kinghood bare,<br>
His army wandered to he knows not where?<br>
Himself in timorous flight? I tell thee no.<br>
From these unleadered hordes we will not flee,<br>
But seek our friends. For when the loss they see<br>
Of those who ruled them in one heap aside<br>
As refuse cast, if any heart to bide<br>
Continue theirs, our gathered force anew<br>
Shall slay two foes for one before they slew."
<p>
Then by the forest, through its closest screen,<br>
Rode the three comrades, of their foes unseen,<br>
Until such friends they found as had not fled,<br>
Being still bold-hearted, though discomfited,<br>
Whom Arthur ordered and arrayed anew.
<p>
Once more, high-toned, the British bugles blew<br>
Defiant challenge, as the Table knights,<br>
Constant in valour though their ranks were less,<br>
Charged out on foes bewildered, leaderless.<br>
Unsure of others or themselves were they:<br>
The wolves of night were morning's sheep to slay.
<p>
So from reverse high heart its vantage caught.<br>
Much praise had Kay, as of good right he ought.<br>
Much praise alike had Griflet and Gawain.<br>
Soon was his queen at Arthur's side again,<br>
Glad-eyed his safety and success to see.<br>
Lover of high far-shining deeds was she.
<p>
Cool at sharp need he knew her now to be,<br>
And more approved her. Merlin's warning died<br>
Wholly from one who saw with praiseful pride<br>
How royal was the queen his choice had won.
<p>
Now from King Pellinor's host a courier came.<br>
Blown and bemired his steed. "Lord king," he cried,<br>
"Men in unseemly flight have rumour spread<br>
Of outrage in the night and slaughter red;<br>
Even they babbled that thyself hast died."
<p>
"Greet ye King Pellinor well, and thank his speed,<br>
His loyal will that tells. But hasteful need<br>
There is no longer, for our foes are sped.<br>
He is but ten miles away? Then there should he<br>
His camp arrange, and we will there proceed<br>
To link our counsel, that the realm shall be<br>
Brought by new kings to closer unity."
<p>
Next sought he of the cost of victory,<br>
And found that darkness and confusion bred<br>
Semblance of slaughter that the light denied.<br>
Eight Table Knights in their pavilions died:<br>
Two hundred warriors on the field were dead.<br>
"Light was the cost of such a gain." He said,<br>
"And thanks to Heaven our liberal hearts should pay.<br>
Here shall be built an abbey fair and rich,<br>
Dowered with wide lands, and stablished long to be<br>
For weakness or for guilt God's sanctuary:<br>
Haven for those who learn, or those who pray."
<p>
So was it done. An Abbey fair and good,<br>
And titled with great lands and livelihood,<br>
Rose by the Humber in near days to be.<br>
Of High Adventure was it named, to tell<br>
To future years what in the night befell,<br>
And how reversed was panic's mastery<br>
By those who would not fear, and would not flee.
<p>
III.<br>
Triumphant now in Camelot's halls the king<br>
His Table called for such high banqueting<br>
As well might hail the five-fold victory<br>
Which welded his wide realm from sea to sea.<br>
But when they gathered, of the glorious ring<br>
Eight seats were vacant.
<p>
"Give me choice," he said<br>
To Pellinor, who beside him sate, "of names<br>
In no way meaner than the previous fames<br>
Of those who by that sharp surprise are dead."
<p>
"Sire, my conceit is this. Good knights are here<br>
- Right noble knights - who would not least appear<br>
Even with thine own, and these more numerous far<br>
Than at thy board the vacant spaces are.<br>
Choose thee four knights from them of years discreet,<br>
Alike for turmoil or for counsel meet;<br>
And four of valour, but whose years are less,<br>
Whose lack of counsel now will time redress:<br>
Some of a constant strength to keep thy side,<br>
And some more fit on arduous quests to ride."
<p>
"Wise were it so to do. What names are thine<br>
To match thy precept?"
<p>
"Sire, if choice were mine,<br>
King Urience, who hath held thy part, and wed<br>
So near thy throne, were first; and next were said<br>
Lancelot, though still of youthful years, who shows<br>
Not valour alone, but such high nobleness<br>
That all besides may prove at last the less,<br>
And skilled to rule both camp and strife is he.<br>
Herve and Galagar next I join. And then,<br>
To find the younger four I first would name<br>
Thy nephew, Gawain, though no friend to me.<br>
For if I be good judge of stedfast men,<br>
Though bitter in his hates, and hard is he<br>
The spoils of life to take, he will not fail<br>
To menace most thy foes; and chose I then<br>
Griflet, for should his ardent youth avail<br>
To guard his life through ventures wild and far,<br>
Few may excel him at last. My third is Kay,<br>
Whose fault of prideful boast should noway bar<br>
Reward for that he did two kings to slay."
<p>
"I well approve it. Name thy last."
<p>
"I name<br>
King Baudemagus. Stronger knights may be;<br>
But keen and fearless as a flame is he.<br>
Or if that not on him thy choice should fall,<br>
Then might I speak of Tor, nor think it shame,<br>
Whom, were he not my son, I well might call<br>
Proved both in arm and heart, resolved and strong,<br>
And loth alike to take or work a wrong."
<p>
"Yea, said the king, "I count him proved and true;<br>
And slow to speak perchance, but swift to do;<br>
And were his mother's race as proud as thine,<br>
Haply not half these chosen knights of mine<br>
Would equal. He this time preferred shall be;<br>
And Baudemagus, little less than he<br>
In knightly prowess, and no whit the less<br>
Either in honour or in gentleness,<br>
Shall have the seat that next shall vacant fall."
<p>
Then did the king those knights he favoured call<br>
To take the vacant seats, and those who still<br>
Crowded the lower boards, each chosen name<br>
Applauded as he moved his place to fill.
<p>
But Baudemagus rose: "Lord King, I see<br>
Is here no welcome, and no place for me,<br>
However promptly at thy call I came."
<p>
He turned, not waiting for the king's reply,<br>
Wood wroth that younger knights of less degree,<br>
Near kin to those conferring kings, should be<br>
So favoured to his own indignity,<br>
Being himself of royal rank and style.
<p>
So to his household in that ire he went,<br>
And bade them all to horse, to homeward ride.<br>
Forth from the city, many a woodland mile,<br>
Northward he led; his wrath incontinent,<br>
Even from his train, he had no strength to hide,<br>
Till cooler thoughts controlled: "Though wrong I feel<br>
At this despite, yet more the shame were mine<br>
Should anger at such shame my deeds reveal."
<p>
Whereat he halted at a crossway shrine,<br>
Seeing how small a thing the shame he had<br>
Beside the eternal glory symboled there.<br>
And long he knelt devout in humblest prayer,<br>
Till God's peace touched him, and his heart was glad.
<p>
IV.<br>
Edged by the gold of sunset cold and clear,<br>
The wide horizon of the silent mere<br>
Showed silken sails full-breasted toward the land.<br>
In that still air they felt no wind's command,<br>
Owned nor controlling voice nor steering hand,<br>
Yet winged they came toward that waiting strand<br>
Where Arthur, Urience of the land of Gore,<br>
And that young knight of Gaul, Sir Accolon,<br>
Watched the white sails, and wondered what they bore.
<p>
Fair on the royal chase that morn had shone,<br>
Fast the strong hart fled through the passing day,<br>
By that broad water brought at last to bay,<br>
And slain by these that followed. Only they<br>
With toiling steeds that long pursuit sustained,<br>
And lost them, foundered, as their chase was gained.
<p>
The full sails furled them with no hand: no sound<br>
Came from it as the light keel grazed aground:<br>
No motion on that still deck stirred. The king<br>
Laughed in good heart: "Now here be weirds," said he<br>
"As ever I loved. More worth to seek and see<br>
Than aught that wealths can spoil or wisdoms bring."<br>
Lightly the side he clomb, but naught he saw.<br>
The twain, of no weak hearts, but larger awe,<br>
Behind him came. Some cabin space therein<br>
They searched in vain. Though furnished all, and dight<br>
Richly, and from its own pale heart alight,<br>
A marvel, where no light was else - for now<br>
The low sun had declined the western sky,<br>
And no moon rose, and wide in heaven encamped<br>
The starless dark - they might not there descry<br>
One living mortal who that barque had brought.<br>
But as they left, with eyes its light had lamped,<br>
Facing again the darkness, darker so,<br>
They stumbled in their blinded steps, and turned<br>
To gain the guidance of that light, and lo!<br>
The white strip glowed throughout a rosier flame,<br>
And down its shining side twelve damsels came,<br>
While seemed in molten fire the whole ship burned,<br>
Yet by that fire uninjured, on the sands<br>
Those damsels knelt. Low-voiced, with pleading hands,<br>
The king's high favour and his grace they prayed<br>
To deign his presence at their feast arrayed<br>
Within the lighted barque.
<p>
"Fair maids," said he,<br>
"Too much anhungered and bespent are we<br>
To answer nay to that. But lead ye on,<br>
I would not be the first that fire to tread."
<p>
"Nay, ye shall find it fair," the damsels said,<br>
And through the unburning light that round them shone<br>
Toward the wonder at its heart they led.
<p>
For in that ship, beyond the whole ship's size,<br>
Came those three comrades with amazed eyes,<br>
To where a hall of banquet, richly dight,<br>
And princely furnished in all points aright,<br>
Their ease assured. And meats and wines were brought,<br>
Not as they asked, but all to match their thought,<br>
Instant and best.
<p>
No better meal can be<br>
Than when that that we long is that we see.<br>
So thought the king, in fearless heart content;<br>
And satiate when the evening hours were spent<br>
He followed freely to a chamber fair<br>
In all things furnished for his comfort there.
<p>
Sir Accolon also, and the King of Gore,<br>
To separate rooms of royal state were led.<br>
And found for wearied limbs so soft a bed<br>
That well they slept.
<p>
But while they slept too well,<br>
Moved to its end Queen Morgan's treasoned spell.
<p>
Warm waked King Urience, many a league away,<br>
Halsed in the white arms of his wife, Le Fey;<br>
But Arthur, cold in darkness, waked to hear<br>
Cries of the marsh, and murmurs of the mere.
<p>
A narrow casement with a single bar<br>
Dimly he saw, where seldom came a star,<br>
And the moon crossed it in too brief a while<br>
That showed no comfort. Through what glamorous guile<br>
He was translated to that dungeon cell<br>
He could not guess, but yet could surely tell<br>
A foe had done it, and a foe to fear.
<p>
Nor was there comfort in the sounds that rose<br>
Of lamentation round him. "Friends," he said,<br>
"For friends I deem ye if alike misled<br>
Ye here are brought against your wills as I,<br>
Can any tell me by what enmity<br>
This evil came?"
<p>
And with one voice replied<br>
The twenty captive knights who round him lay:<br>
"Are ye another? Was the gate so wide<br>
Ye entered unduressed and ignorant?<br>
Soon may ye enter here, and long repent.<br>
But most who come were brought a different way."
<p>
"That would I learn," he said; "for naught I know."
<p>
"However came ye here to share our woe,<br>
One are we by the like adversity,<br>
And freely may we speak. Three years have gone<br>
- Or more or less - three years of causeless thrall,<br>
Since we, on whom God's light of morning shone,<br>
Have languished in this gloom of narrowing wall,<br>
And bars through which that single space of sky<br>
Sees the sun never, and the stars go by.
<p>
"What was our fault? No fault these bonds belong,<br>
Except we would not, to uphold a wrong,<br>
On our vain swords against High God rely,<br>
And by the verdict of His justice die."
<p>
"More would I hear."
<p>
"The tale is short to tell.<br>
In this strong hold a caitiff knight doth dwell,<br>
Sir Damas. Not the foulest sewer of Hell<br>
Would find his worse. A very coward is he,<br>
And false and treasoned to the like degree.<br>
He hath a brother of a nobler sort,<br>
Of loyal practice and of bold report,<br>
Sir Outzlake, who doth dwell two leagues away,<br>
Holding a manor, as by strength he may,<br>
Which is but little to his right, for all<br>
The wealth which at their father's death did fall<br>
Into Sir Damas' hands, from greed and pride,<br>
He would not as by rightful use divide.
<p>
"Against this wrong Sir Outzlake made appeal,<br>
That either in fair combat, steel to steel,<br>
He would God's verdict take, or else provide<br>
A champion for his part. No knight alive<br>
Could that decline. No craven, false as he,<br>
Could dare to thus defend his perfidy.<br>
A champion knight he sought, but found that none<br>
Against Sir Outzlake in such cause would strive,<br>
Even for much gold. In this extremity,<br>
To seize good knights by craft he did not spare,<br>
And hold them captive here, except they swear<br>
His part to take. And so, with words of guile,<br>
He doth the appointed combat-hour delay,<br>
Year following year, and dungeoned here the while,<br>
Shackled and starved that some have died thereby,<br>
And some so weak from lengthened hunger lie<br>
They may not stand, we in his danger stay,<br>
Refusing freedom by his shameful way."
<p>
"Full evil is thy tale," the king replied,<br>
"And simple of belief the while I share<br>
The bondage that ye tell. To break the snare<br>
Good hope must still be mine. I will not deem<br>
But I can wake me from so foul a dream."
<p>
So spake they till the dawn the darkness slew,<br>
What time a damsel to King Arthur drew,<br>
Courteous of speech, and gentle-meined, who said:<br>
"Fair lord, what cheer?"
<p>
"I would I surelier knew."
<p>
"Lord, thine the choice. A champion's part to play<br>
Is all thy need. But else thy days are sped<br>
Of freedom on fair height, or woodland way."
<p>
And Arthur answered lightly: "Liever I,<br>
So foul my choice, in such vain strife would die<br>
Than in these dungeons starve... Now grant I take<br>
This combat for his need, will Damas break<br>
The bondage of these knights? And well provide<br>
Proved arms for peril, and sure steed to ride?"
<p>
"Yea, all thou wilt," she said, "he'll grant with speed,<br>
So bold a knight to gain to meet his need."
<p>
"Damsel," he said, "thy face thy voice, suggest<br>
Some doubtful memory mine..... In earlier quest,<br>
Or at the court of Arthur, once we met?"
<p>
"Nay, for my youth in these strait towers hath grown.<br>
Palace or wild alike I have not known.<br>
Lord Damas' daughter I."
<p>
So smoothly lied<br>
A damsel of Le Fey.
<p>
To Damas next<br>
She went as falsely. Little thought was his<br>
Of whom she served in secret. "Lord, there is<br>
A strange knight taken in thy seat,<br>
By whom Sir Outzlake should be shrewdly vexed,<br>
If bribes or threats should gain him."
<p>
"Bring him here."<br>
And when King Arthur came, a likely knight<br>
He thought him, and solemn oath was plight<br>
On Arthur's side to take that evil strife,<br>
To gain for Damas or to loss of life;<br>
At which consent Sir Damas straight released<br>
The twenty captives that he held before.
<p>
For Arthur thought: "If wrong the cause I take<br>
It will not triumph, but I dread me more<br>
Such captive thrall than that my life were ceased<br>
By God's high verdict; and these knights to free<br>
Is one thing good; and better end may be<br>
Than one who sees not to the last can see."
<p>
V.<br>
Sir Accolon wakened by a deep well-side,<br>
Wherefrom a fountain flung a glittering tide<br>
That backward into marble basins fell.<br>
Therefrom he gazed in marvelled doubt around<br>
And saw sloped lawns and sweeping walks that wound,<br>
Twixt lawns and lake, and tamed and ordered well;<br>
And by the lake a male swan preened his pride,<br>
And from the further trees a peacock cried.<br>
It was a fair wide pleasance, made for man;<br>
Yet stilled it seemed as though, since time began,<br>
Had no man moved therein, nor tempest stirred;<br>
Or fey had formed it from a faery word.
<p>
But fear was his that altered scene to see,<br>
As memory waked, and swift he rose. "Perde,"<br>
Aloud he spake, "some strange enchantment here<br>
With sight's delusion mocks, and sharp my fear<br>
That those fair burdens of the faery boats<br>
Have meant my lord but evil. Would my brand<br>
Had slit the lying whiteness of their throats<br>
The while they knelt before us on the strand."
<p>
Then with a wider-seeking gaze he knew<br>
Those distant towers, dove-white, that broke the blue,<br>
Where once had Morgan held him lightly thralled<br>
In willing bondage. Now his thought recalled<br>
How, for more favours than indeed he knew,<br>
(For memory of the most her arts withdrew,<br>
So that the truth was dream, and dreams were true),<br>
His pledge she held her champion's part to do.
<p>
Then at his side a white-clad dwarf appeared,<br>
Wide-mouthed, flat-visaged, monstrous as the feared<br>
Elves of the Caves.
<p>
"The queen I serve," he said,<br>
"Morgan Le Fey, sends greeting, bids you know<br>
The test you pledged is here. If now you show<br>
The fearless valour that approved your vow<br>
Her guerdon will not fail. If do you now<br>
Battle to the utterance, being most merciless,<br>
That her most foe he fallen beyond redress<br>
(Thy private promise when some grace she gave),<br>
Then to thy chosen damsel who shall bring<br>
His off-hewn head she will such largesse dower<br>
Of wide estate and strength of sheltering tower<br>
That she shall greet thee next as queen to king,<br>
Yet soft of mood to be thine underling.
<p>
"Who serves Le Fey hath little need to fear.<br>
Behold, to guard thy life she sends thee here<br>
King Arthur's sword, his own Excalibar.<br>
Much in the trenchant blade its virtues are,<br>
But in the scabbard most its safety lies,<br>
For who shall wear it finds the quick blood dries<br>
As instant as the wounding steel retires."
<p>
Sir Accolon answered: "Not for hell's hot fires<br>
My given word were changed. But say what time<br>
This combat joins?"
<p>
"Tomorrow's hour of prime."
<p>
"When did you see the queen?"
<p>
"An hour ago."
<p>
"Commend me to her grace, and say that so,<br>
Even as thy words have been, shall all things be.<br>
I only would it were my part to see<br>
Herself once more, who still to thrall me seems<br>
A thought of God incarnate, reached in dreams,<br>
But lost to wakeful days; and that she wills<br>
Shall neither heavenly boons nor earthly ills<br>
Divert me to denial.... I well suppose<br>
That these enchantments had no purpose else<br>
But here my presence for this strife to bring?"
<p>
"You likely may suppose a likely thing."
<p>
VI<br>
Even as the dwarf retired, his purpose done,<br>
There came a knight in peaceful garb, who brought<br>
His lady with him, both who fair besought<br>
Sir Accolon's favour at their hall to bide.<br>
And he unloth in grateful words replied,<br>
At which their squires a void horse forward led,<br>
And he went with them.
<p>
In short time they came<br>
Where a fair manor by a priory stood,<br>
Between a broad stream and a branching wood.<br>
Here to his guest Sir Outzlake gave his name,<br>
Which Accolon had not heard. Next hour was brought<br>
Word from Sir Damas of no peaceful sort.
<p>
"I have a champion for my need," he wrote,<br>
"Who at tomorrow's prime in field will stand<br>
To stint the clamour from thy slandering throat.<br>
Do thou be there, or never more expand<br>
Thy bray of valour, or thy whine of wrong."
<p>
"Now," said Sir Outzlake, "is my chance, and lo!<br>
A wound unhealed is mine - doth Damas know? -<br>
Which makes me for such bout awhile unfit.<br>
Yet for my honour and lands to venture it<br>
Needs would I, though the strength to stand upright<br>
I scantly know. To find a champion knight<br>
Never my brother's need as mine today!"
<p>
Then spoke Sir Accolon: "The need you say<br>
Be mine to fill. A royal sword I bear<br>
Intended surely for the overthrow<br>
Of not thine only but my lady's foe."
<p>
Sir Outzlake said: "Whatever sword you wear<br>
It is not stouter than thy heart, to take<br>
A strife not thine; and for what lady's sake<br>
I know not, but for equal thanks I know<br>
Who is not hence thy friend hath twice a foe."
<p>
Then sent he to Sir Damas bold reply:<br>
"A champion for the morn alike have I.<br>
May God the right to His conclusion bring."
<p>
VII<br>
So came at next day's prime the captived king<br>
To meet Sir Accolon, while neither knew<br>
Whose hand the opposing sword of conflict drew,<br>
Yet each believed a makeless sword he bore.<br>
For Arthur, of his cause less confident,<br>
Was of his sword assured, for Morgan sent<br>
That morn to him a secret messenger.<br>
With sheath and sword that seemed Excalibar.<br>
Why should he doubt of it? Or doubt of her?<br>
His sister, wedded to a king who gave<br>
Allegiance to his throne? He grasped the glaive<br>
With grateful words, and cast his own away,<br>
Not pausing in that haste to charge her say<br>
How of his sudden need Queen Morgan knew.
<p>
So in the lists for that stern ordeal set,<br>
Knightly with urge of rushing steeds they met.<br>
Held the great lances, guided straight and well:<br>
Chargers and knights alike reversed and fell,<br>
And rose alike, and while their squires withdrew<br>
The struggling steeds, the champions' swords were bare.<br>
Clattering they met. Strong hearts, strong arms were there<br>
To take or deal, and still the strife renew.<br>
For Accolon thought beyond that victory<br>
The mistress of his fevered dream to see,<br>
Nor doubt of error in his cause had he.<br>
And Arthur thought: 'No noble part have I.<br>
Yet think I am not in these toils to die.'<br>
Not reason, but high heart, upheld him now<br>
To sanguine sureness that he should not fall<br>
From his great place in this unlikely brawl.<br>
Nor least in that good sword, Excalibar,<br>
His trust was set, although that sword he felt<br>
Not in his hand, but by the blows it dealt.
<p>
Soon was his need for constant heart increased,<br>
For vainly on his foeman's helm he beat,<br>
But Accolon's sword was harder steel to meet.<br>
For every stroke that reached him, most or least,<br>
Reddened his mail; until the truth he guessed<br>
With sickening heart, although he failed to see<br>
By what strange dealings could such treason be.
<p>
Yet not his crest, and not his sword therefor<br>
He lowlier held, but with heart more high<br>
He conquered that cold doubt. 'For, last or die,'<br>
He thought, 'Pendragon from no field shall flee.<br>
Slain if I must, but shamed I will not, be.'
<p>
Aloud Sir Accolon now, exulting cried:<br>
But Arthur silent, with such stroke replied:<br>
That Accolon bent, and some short space withdrew.<br>
But then, in woundless strength, he rushed anew,<br>
On Arthur, and that stroke in kind repaid.
<p>
Now Arthur stooped, but still his desperate blade,<br>
Powerless to wound, the threatening end delayed.<br>
While the great crowd that watched with wonder saw<br>
That though, from out so many wounds he bled<br>
That all his arms and all the ground were red,<br>
He did not from the assailing sword withdraw,<br>
Whereat much pity and much praise was said.
<p>
There was a damsel at Sir Damas' side,<br>
One of the hundreds, lord and knight and dame<br>
Of the bright crowd who to that conflict came.<br>
Silent she watched the while the strife was tried,<br>
With quiet eyes aloof from all she saw,<br>
As one who naught contemned, and naught could awe.<br>
Now to Sir Damas spake she, cool and low;<br>
"Fair lord, you near an end you do not know.<br>
Thy champion falters. To thy gain it were<br>
To cease this trial, and the wrong repair<br>
Which will not longer wait its time."
<p>
And he<br>
Warned in such sort, who knew not Nimue,<br>
Short answer gave: "My champion holds his place,<br>
And yet may conquer."
<p>
"If he gain for thee,<br>
Thy more defeat is in that victory.<br>
Be it as thou wilt."
<p>
No further heed she gave<br>
To one she vainly warned; but all her care<br>
Was now for Arthur. He, short breath to save,<br>
Drew somewhat back, and for some resting-space<br>
He called, as warriors by consent would do,<br>
To pause awhile and then the strife renew,<br>
If equal valour should its end delay.
<p>
But Accolon answered: "Nay, for more thy need.<br>
Thou art mine by many wounds to save or slay.<br>
Resume or yield;" and Arthur, wrothed thereby,<br>
Swung up his sword, and made his hard reply<br>
On Accolon's helm, who reeling backward went.<br>
But Arthur larglier might that stroke repent,<br>
For snapt the sword beneath the hilt. He held<br>
The pommel only. Fear he needs must feel;<br>
Yet still against despair his heart rebelled,<br>
And with his covering shield he faced his foe.
<p>
"Now yield ye recreant, or your life forgo."
<p>
"I may not," said the King; "mine oath is sworn<br>
To strive while life shall last, and that would I<br>
Though with bare hands, and were I slain thereby<br>
A hundred times, for shamed I would not live."
<p>
"Then must I slay thee, though I lack the will."
<p>
"Shame will be thine a swordless knight to kill."
<p>
"Thy life thy knowest that I may not give<br>
Except you recreant yield. I will not spare,<br>
Unless Sir Damas' claim you all forswear."
<p>
"That will I never."
<p>
"Thine the choice."
<p>
Thereat<br>
His sword he raised as one who ruth forgat.<br>
But Arthur dived the coming stroke below,<br>
And hard his shield upthrust at Accolon's chin,<br>
While with the hilt he dealt so shrewd a blow<br>
That Nimue, watching with calm eyes, as naught<br>
Their depths could trouble with disturbing thought,<br>
Saw that which men have guessed she willed to see.<br>
For stumbled both, and Arthur to his knee<br>
Went down; but fell from Accolon's bruise-numbed hand<br>
The enchanted sword, and Arthur snatched the brand<br>
Even as it fell, and as its hilt he knew<br>
The truth was plain: "Oh, truant sword," he cried,<br>
"Much evil hast thou done me!" Ere he smote.<br>
He snatched the scabbard from Sir Accolon's side,<br>
And cast it far: "Oh, knight," he said, "to you<br>
All that you gave me can I now restore.<br>
On thine own head shall fall thy precepts now.<br>
Sayest thou the swordless I of right should slay?"
<p>
Steel of strong helm, and lift of sheltering shield<br>
The great sword countered in midstroke, but shore<br>
Unhindered way. His stumbling foeman fell<br>
Sore wounded from that sorcerous strife, and lay<br>
The king's point offering at his throat, that well<br>
Might now its own enforced treason pay.
<p>
"Bethink you," said the King, "except you yield<br>
I thrust." And Accolon answered: "That you may.<br>
Light is the toil a fallen knight to slay;<br>
And well from that sword-changing chance I see<br>
That God is on thy part, and not with me.<br>
I ask thee naught. Mine oath is pledged too deep<br>
My life in recreance from this field to keep,<br>
Were death more far."
<p>
But Arthur answered: "Nay,"<br>
- For half it seemed that distant voice he knew -<br>
"But speak thou first thy name, lest wrath fordo<br>
That ruth might save."
<p>
The fallen answered: "I<br>
Who here death-hurt beyond thy danger lie,<br>
Beyond alike thy threats or mercy, well<br>
Might all refuse, but that I choose to tell.<br>
Accolon of Gaul, and Arthur's knight am I."
<p>
King Arthur heard and knew. With swift dismay,<br>
His thought recalled the barque, the dungeon cell,<br>
The sword his sister sent. He answered: "Say<br>
How to your hand Excalibar came?"
<p>
"My woe<br>
That magic sword hath been, myself to slay."
<p>
"I doubt it naught; but answer."
<p>
"Queen le Fey<br>
Sent me that sword but yestermorn. I show<br>
More than I need, the fuller truth to tell.<br>
Because I love her, and she loves me well,<br>
She sent it, charging me this strife to take,<br>
And slay thee surely (whom I do not know;<br>
Or know thee only as her chosen foe).<br>
But earlier in my hands that sword hath been,<br>
And destined for more treasonous use. The Queen<br>
Waited the chance when, for her dearest sake,<br>
I might King Arthur find apart and slay;<br>
When would she likewise with King Urience deal,<br>
And be the whole land's ruler. Then should I<br>
Be owned her lover with no more conceal,<br>
And reign beside her. But I think to die<br>
Of this deep wound; and now that dream is through<br>
I ask no other than thy name to learn,<br>
For whom did Heaven this strife against me turn,<br>
And of what court ye be."
<p>
"You know not that?"
<p>
"I swear I know not."
<p>
"That you thought to do<br>
You did most nearly. Arthur's self am I."
<p>
"Oh, gracious lord, forgive! I all confess<br>
Of plotted evil, but did not guess<br>
That thou didst front me here."
<p>
"I that believe;<br>
And therefore somewhat would thy fault reprieve,<br>
And that the more because at last I know<br>
My sister's falsehood to its depth, and grieve<br>
Her subtle crafts, that can, with lustful bait,<br>
Corrupt good knights who on her favours wait:<br>
Favours less certain than their wage of woe.<br>
Well may I mercy find to pardon them,<br>
Who must myself for kindred fault condemn.
<p>
"Have I not trusted her as none beside,<br>
As castellan preferred to friend or bride<br>
To keep this sword on which may life depend,<br>
Heedless to warning word from bride or friend?<br>
Vengeance I should not and I shall not spare<br>
Shall pass thee by, who laid her treason bare."
<p>
Then to the Keepers of the Field he called:<br>
"Behold," he said, "this strife yourselves have seen<br>
Hath been full bitter, yet it had not been<br>
Had we two knights been told of whom we were<br>
By those who knew, and did its end contrive -<br>
An end of treason which there will not be."
<p>
Then from the ground Sir Accolon spake: "Give heed,<br>
All ye who hear me. Here before you stands<br>
The lord of all our lives and all our lands,<br>
Arthur, our gracious sovereign, liege and king.<br>
Dying, by God's high boon from falsehood freed,<br>
I here declare it, and repent full sore<br>
That guiled I fell to such misfortuning."
<p>
Then wondered all who heard, but feared the more<br>
The kingdom's lord in such a pass to see.<br>
"Mercy, good lord, for who the truth could tell,<br>
Or guess their liege in Damas' arms should be?"
<p>
"Mercy," the King replied, "is lightly thine,<br>
For errant chance, that brought this knight of mine<br>
To such contention, to our equal bane,<br>
Is not your guilt. But ere my wounds prevail<br>
Hear how I fought, and why I did not fail:<br>
False was my cause, but treason held the field.<br>
God's judgements will not to such treasons yield,<br>
And hence I conquered. By that victory<br>
All that Sir Damas claimed hath come to be<br>
His proven right. That right I first allow;<br>
But as your king I give my judgement now<br>
On other issues that mine eyes have seen.
<p>
"Sir Damas, by whose hands good knights have been,<br>
Through thy much violence and thy villany,<br>
Dungeoned without offence, without appeal,<br>
Mercy I grant on three observances.<br>
First, thou shalt all these twenty knights restore<br>
Not to mere freedom, but content them more<br>
With horse and harness than they owned before,<br>
And all that knighthood needs. If only one<br>
To Camelot bring complaint that less be done<br>
Knight will I send who shall thy life require<br>
In mortal field, and of such bold repute<br>
That champion for thy part thou shalt not hire,<br>
Nor shalt thou practice to that strife delay -<br>
The day he cometh shall be thine ending day.
<p>
"Next, thou shalt swear upon the sacred page<br>
Thou wilt no further in such toils engage<br>
By-wandering knights; and if thou dost again,<br>
Thou shalt be surely by my justice slain.
<p>
"Last, to Sir Outzlake shall thou grant anew<br>
The manor-lands he held, his seemly due.<br>
But he shall pay thee as their rent agreed<br>
A yearly palfrey of a peaceful breed;<br>
For not a charger, great of heart and thew,<br>
Thy meagre knighthood needs."
<p>
To Outzlake next<br>
He spake: "Because men call thee bold, nor less<br>
Of good regard for truth and gentleness,<br>
Thou shalt with me to Camelot ride, and there,<br>
Be thy deeds equal, and thy fame as fair<br>
As these report, by God's good grace will I<br>
So serve thee that short time shall testify<br>
Thy greater worship and thy more domain<br>
Than Damas boasteth, or such crafts obtain."
<p>
"Go will I gladly at thy side."
<p>
"Then say<br>
How far from Camelot am I snatched astray?"
<p>
"A two days' journey when the roads are dry."
<p>
"Then must I rest me first. What place is nigh<br>
Of worship for mine ease?"
<p>
"Three miles away<br>
There is an abbey of nuns of high degree,<br>
King Uther founded. There thy rest should be<br>
Secure, and bruise and hurt well comforted."
<p>
"There will I," said the king, "and bid prepare<br>
A litter for Sir Accolon. Harboured there,<br>
He shall be tended well, and leeched with care,<br>
For he was by most sorcerous arts misled.<br>
Because my sister would my life betray.<br>
I will not vengeance on her instrument."
<p>
So to that Abbey's kindly roof they went<br>
Victims alike of Morgan's lustful guile.<br>
There Arthur well revived his strength forespent,<br>
But Accolon, less of good blood drained, the while<br>
Died as men die whose hope is past.
<p>
Before<br>
Death found him, memories that her art had blurred<br>
Returned, but is such sort that all he saw<br>
Was outward seeming, of himself as she<br>
Seduced him to her wanton, ruthless will....
<p>
The noon was summer and the woods were still.<br>
Relaxed in sleep her body's grace unclad<br>
Gleamed in the deep cool greenness of the glade.<br>
Well knew she none would pass that path unstayed<br>
While thus she lay. No watchful need was hers<br>
Her lure to prove. But waking eyes forbad<br>
What sleep might yield, nor larger need imply.
<p>
No adder on the sunwarmed path might lie<br>
Deadlier, nor less the coming foot to care,<br>
Than in that shadowed glade beside the way<br>
The sorceress slept.
<p>
The pacing hooves were still.<br>
The steel, toiled-heated, stayed content. The noise<br>
Of silenced birds returned the boughs. Nor dare<br>
To wake this goddess of the woods, nor will<br>
To leave such sight his heart could hold, until<br>
She stirred, and eyes that seeming sleep had hid<br>
Were on him, shameless with abrupt desire.
<p>
So watched he with cold heart the deed he did<br>
With hotter pulses at her lustful lure.<br>
Shrank his shamed thoughts therefrom, so base a hire<br>
To own, and saw fair death, the waiting cure.<br>
Divided from his previous self was he<br>
By God's accepted light his sin to see.
<p>
VIII.<br>
Then Arthur to the gate of Morgan sent<br>
The corse of Accolon. 'Behold,' he wrote,<br>
'How vainly by the craft his life is spent!<br>
Take the poor barter of thy sorcerous trade.<br>
Mine is the sheath again, and mine the blade.'
<p>
But ere they reached, Queen Morgan, deeming sure<br>
The death of Arthur in that nameless guise,<br>
Rose with the morn, and looked with hateful eyes<br>
On Urience sleeping. In short words she bid<br>
One of those damsels who her treasons did<br>
His sword to fetch: "No better time than now<br>
To end his life," she said, "will fate allow."
<p>
"Oh, madam, if our noble lord we slay,<br>
No art will save us, but our lives will pay."
<p>
"Nay, fetch the sword. You all misdeem. To me<br>
The rule remains. But those who first obey<br>
Will be the first their bright reward to see."
<p>
With no more words the damsel turned. She went<br>
To where Ewaine in morning slumber lay.<br>
"Oh, wake," she cried, "or else, our curse to be,<br>
A deed of shame your mother seeks to do,<br>
Which long we might, and all our land repent,<br>
And no one will she heed, or only you."
<p>
"Well," said Ewaine, "to do the Queen's commands<br>
Is thine, who else may long her vengeance feel.<br>
Go by the way she wills, and let me deal."
<p>
No more the damsel said. With trembling hands<br>
To Morgan's firmer grasp the sword she bore,<br>
Who from the sheath the long bright blade outslid,<br>
And cool and well-assured in all she did<br>
Went boldly to the bed, and stood beside,<br>
Pausing one moment only to decide<br>
Where best the point to drive as Urience lay.
<p>
But as she raised the sword, a hand she felt<br>
Grasping her wrist. Appalled, and hard, and low<br>
The voice she heard: "Ah, fiend, and wouldst thou so?<br>
Men say that Merlin had a fiend for sire,<br>
But I may say a devil's womb I knew."
<p>
She loosed the sword, against his feet she knelt.<br>
"Ah, son, fair son, Ewaine, as God is true<br>
It was not of my will. Such moods of woe<br>
At times possess me that I think to do<br>
That which I would not. Hadst thou not been here<br>
I had but feigned it, and the sword put by."
<p>
"Ah, mother, but for that dear name," he said,<br>
"It were this moment that would see you dead.<br>
But now I know not what were right to do."
<p>
"Fair son, have mercy, as by God I swear<br>
I will that moment's evil thought repair<br>
By loving service to my lord and you.<br>
Only reveal not what hath been! For so<br>
Would all my honour and my worship go."
<p>
"Might I so much believe - "
<p>
"Fair son, you may.<br>
Thee have I always loved, and all I say<br>
Will for thy sake be done."
<p>
"Ah, well!" Said he,<br>
"God grant it!"
<p>
All the while their words they kept<br>
So low, that all unware King Urience slept.
<p>
IX.<br>
Queen Morgan read the scroll King Arthur sent.<br>
She looked at Accolon, whom to death she led.<br>
Nigh burst her heart with grief, but naught she said,<br>
Nor showed that grief with which her heart was rent.<br>
But well the shortness of her life she guessed<br>
If Arthur caught her now. She sought the Queen.<br>
"I have such tidings that I may not rest<br>
Until I right them. Give me grace to go."
<p>
Guenever answered: "Nay, ye would not so<br>
Till Arthur join us? From this strange delay<br>
It is not likely that a longer day<br>
Will hold him."
<p>
"Haste is mine. I must not stay."
<p>
"Well, as thou wilt."
<p>
That night, with all her train,<br>
Queen Morgan passed the gate. All day she rode,<br>
Longing the safety of the towers of Gore.<br>
Yet subtly swerving from the nearer way,<br>
Came to the nunnery where King Arthur lay.<br>
Deep in Southgales, beside its wintry lake.
<p>
The steeds were weary, and she did not know,<br>
Till there she lighted, that the king was there.
<p>
Then said she: "Doth he rest? For his dear sake<br>
Hard have I ridden, since I heard of how<br>
He wounded lay."
<p>
They answered: "Nay but now<br>
From long dis-ease he sleeps."
<p>
"Then do not wake.<br>
I will beside him watch, as sisters may."
<p>
With light assent she passed to where he lay,<br>
Thinking the sword once more to gain, but he<br>
Slept with it in his hand, as well might be<br>
After such mischief from its loss afore.
<p>
To wake him was a risk she did not dare.<br>
She took the scabbard; and her weary train<br>
Roused from their hope of rest to ride again.
<p>
X.<br>
King Arthur waked, and cried aloud: "Perde,<br>
Where is that scabbard which I do not see?"
<p>
They told him what had been. Wood wroth was he.<br>
"Is none to trust?"
<p>
"Lord, when thy sister came,<br>
Who were we, to deny so great a name?"
<p>
"Well, what is done will never words recall.<br>
What use is wrath? I had not thought so bold<br>
Even my sister at her chance should be,<br>
Or more had warned. But stir Sir Outzlake now.<br>
And fetch me two good steeds, the best of all<br>
Your stables hold. For on her trace will we<br>
Ride at such pace as never those who flee<br>
Shall equal, though the spurs of fear they ply.<br>
What train was hers?"
<p>
"Her following knights were ten."
<p>
"Then two should drive them. Never valorous men<br>
Doth sorcery breed, nor gold of treason buy."
<p>
Then Arthur armed him at all points, and thus<br>
With Outzlake and good squires, the chase he took<br>
Southward and westward on the road to Gore.<br>
For well he guessed that Morgan's eyes would look<br>
With longing for the rocky height that bore<br>
King Urience' towers. Yet not to risk too far<br>
What doubt must be, when, by a cross of stone,<br>
They saw a poor man resting, there they reined.<br>
"Have any passed thee?"
<p>
"Lord, and hour ago,"<br>
The cowherd answered, "came a headlong rout,<br>
With lashed and jaded steeds, a lady led.<br>
Ten knights full armed were there; and thirty more<br>
The steeds her baggage and her menials bore.<br>
Southward they turned where forks the road ahead."
<p>
"Now must we prove our speed," King Arthur said,<br>
"An hour is little, for they ride but ill."<br>
Faster they rode, awhile by heath and hill,<br>
Awhile through forest wastes, until they saw<br>
The dust of those they chased, which wintry boughs<br>
Were leafless to conceal; and Morgan too<br>
Had seen. She said: "When faster steeds pursue,<br>
What flight avails? Yet narrowing time allows<br>
To foil my brother of his end." She took<br>
The splendid sheath, and on the shelving bank<br>
Of a dark lake she stayed. She flung it far.
<p>
Weighted with gold and gems, too deep it sank<br>
For quest of man to gain it. "Now may look<br>
King Arthur where he will," she laughed, and so<br>
They left the shore of that dark lake, to ride<br>
A drear wide vale and bare, stone-strewn and dry,<br>
Where drifts of mist beneath the low grey sky<br>
Were all too thin their further flight to hide.<br>
And in that fear increased, as fast she fled,<br>
There crossed her thought an ancient charm she read<br>
In early nunnery days, by which she changed<br>
Herself and all the knights that round her ranged<br>
To semblance of the stones they rode. And those<br>
In close pursuit beheld their panting foes<br>
So change, and rode among them, and could not say<br>
Which were the stones before, and which were they.
<p>
"Here," said the King, "God's vengeance, as I ween,<br>
Hath fallen, and no more my sister-queen<br>
Will, with her sorcerous arts, on earth be seen.<br>
Yet should the scabbard in this vale be found."
<p>
Thereat they searched the stones, and all around,<br>
And found all searching, as it must be, vain;<br>
And slowlier to the nunnery rode again.
<p>
Queen Morgan watched the baffled king depart,<br>
And by reversal of her sorcerous art<br>
Restored the animation of her train.
<p>
"You saw the king?" She asked.
<p>
"We saw," they said,<br>
"Such fury in his eyes, and those he led<br>
Were of such perilous kind, that hadst thou not<br>
Constrained us by thy spells we fast had fled."
<p>
"I well believe it."
<p>
Silent then she fell,<br>
Contriving as she rode a subtler plot<br>
Than those that failed her, till her thought returned<br>
To present chancings, as a knight they met<br>
Who to his own another charger's rein<br>
Had joined, for thus a blindfold knight and bound<br>
He led in shameful wise.
<p>
"I charge ye tell,"<br>
Queen Morgan asked, "what recreant deed hath earned<br>
This hard reproach?"
<p>
The knight replied: "The debt<br>
His bonds requite not, but their strength assures<br>
That payment will not fail. When cast and drowned<br>
In the near lake, no more the lewd allures<br>
Of my false wife will cause his heart forget<br>
What friendship owes."
<p>
"What friendship owes? Perde,<br>
But little friendship in those bonds I see.<br>
Why should his grace have been the more to thee<br>
Than thine is now to him? Or wherefore set<br>
Friendship aside, thy chosen friend to slay,<br>
Because a woman goes her natural way?"
<p>
"I have a wrong that only death can pay.<br>
That will she find her natural way to be."
<p>
"You all misvalue. Send them hence unslain.<br>
Enough of damsels for thy use remain.<br>
It may be fairer, and as fain as she."
<p>
"But she was mine. Her honour pledged to me."
<p>
"Doth she allow the fault?"
<p>
"She all denies,<br>
With the sharp fear that spurs a wanton's lies."
<p>
"Doth he admit?"
<p>
"He swears it is not true.<br>
Each time more perjured as he swears anew."
<p>
"Bound knight, how didst thou in this danger fall?"
<p>
"He bound me in my sleep, reversing all<br>
The rules of honour. Had I waked to deal,<br>
He were but carrion for a vulture's meal."
<p>
"How friendship thrives when women sport! But say<br>
Who and from whence thou art?"
<p>
"A knight of Gaul,<br>
Manassen, now of Arthur's Court am I,<br>
Sir Accolon's cousin."
<p>
"Not for Arthur's sake,<br>
But for thy cousin's name, those bonds to break<br>
I must not fail. Good friends, his cords untie,<br>
And he who bound him serve an equal way.<br>
That which Manassen felt himself should feel."
<p>
So was it done. Her knights surrounding laid<br>
Strong sudden hands on him whose foul arrest<br>
A sleeping friend had snared. The knight, dismayed,<br>
Fury and fear despite, and loud protest,<br>
Was quickly bound. Queen Morgan laughed to see.
<p>
"Now wilt thou fight him, friend, or what shall be?"
<p>
"I would deal with him as he meant with me."
<p>
"Friendship endures! But wert thou false or true,<br>
Not so would honour or good knighthood do<br>
As he with thee. And who should bid thee nay,<br>
If his the coin you use the debt to pay?"
<p>
They rode to that deep lake's high-shelving shore,<br>
Wherein the scabbard had been cast before,<br>
And there they drowned him. Were it right or wrong<br>
Queen Morgan cared not. But a jesting word<br>
She gave Manassen: "She he would not share<br>
May now be wholly thine, except she heard<br>
Thine oath that for her best thou dost not care,<br>
And trusts thee less another oath to swear.<br>
Such gods be with thee as thy barter needs!...<br>
But wilt thou to the court at Camelot bear<br>
A sister's message? Tell him naught I fear,<br>
For men I make as stones, or stones appear<br>
As though strong knights of marshalled strength they were.<br>
Tell him I wait my time, and then will do<br>
More than his wit will turn, or Merlin knew."
<p>
Next morn, Queen Morgan gained the towers of Gore,<br>
And all her land she armed, and strengthened well.<br>
For said she: "As Pendragon wrought before<br>
Against my father, so belike with me<br>
His son would deal. But more than earthly skill<br>
To foil him from my secret lore will be<br>
The viewless girdle of the walls I man."
<p>
Meanwhile King Arthur to the court returned,<br>
Whereof all Camelot and the Queen were glad,<br>
Marvelling as of that strange event they learned,<br>
And all the perils and the pains he had.<br>
"There hath not been, since Christian days began,<br>
So false a queen," they said. "Good sight it were<br>
Her stake-bound body in clean fire to see,<br>
For her much treason and adultery."
<p>
Then to the court Manassen came, to bear<br>
Such witness as a dubious tale arrayed.<br>
Morgan's high taunt he to the king conveyed,<br>
Who answered: "What my sister's plots intend<br>
I do not doubt, but yet, with God to aid,<br>
I am not barren of a strengthful friend."
<p>
XI.<br>
When spring released from winter's colder claim<br>
The leafless woodlands, and the mounting sun<br>
Surrender of the willing earth had won,<br>
A fair-clad damsel from Queen Morgan came<br>
With innocent eyes, and words of peace, and prayer<br>
For concord: "All her evil crafts misdone<br>
Shall be amended to thy will: she pleads<br>
Thy mercy, and repents her earlier deeds.<br>
Rich gifts in protest of her meaning fair<br>
Before thy throne I spread. She prays thee wear<br>
This garment, princely as thyself."
<p>
She laid<br>
A mantle at his feet of ermine rare,<br>
And set with gems of price beyond compare<br>
Of aught the court contained, or Arthur's eyes<br>
Had seen till then; and half he thought to rise<br>
And take a gift so great, and half afraid<br>
Of Morgan's guile, his outstretched hand he stayed,<br>
Then rose resolved to take. But haply he<br>
Paused at the warning voice of Nimue:<br>
"Lord king, you may not from the gift divide<br>
The hand that gives it. Let this cloak be tried<br>
On her who brought it hither."
<p>
That damsel's cheek<br>
Paled at the words, but ready speech and meek<br>
Was her to meet it: "Good my lord," she said,<br>
"Most gladly would I please thy grace, but I,<br>
Mean-born, the bearer of the gift, should die<br>
At Morgan's wrathful hand if word misled<br>
Her hastier mood, to judge I soiled thereby,<br>
Impelled by pride, a thing so priced; or worse,<br>
As scorning of her princely gift were read<br>
So strange a deed. And, for myself, beside,<br>
Maid am I, and may not for repute reverse<br>
For kingly garb the maiden zone I wear."
<p>
He answered: "Ill you plead. So great her pride,<br>
You deem she would not own my right, but dare<br>
To slay thee for obedience given? I know<br>
The love she showed that wrought her recent woe;<br>
And that thieved sword my mind recalls. Do thou,<br>
And with swift hands, the thing I speak, for now<br>
You stand suspect of treason."
<p>
Still she stood,<br>
Appalled, and glancing right and left, as though<br>
For Morgan's sorcerous aid, and Arthur signed<br>
To force her. Then, as one to death resigned,<br>
The cloak she loosely round her shoulders drew.<br>
No further word she spake. To ground she sank<br>
Smouldering as one of liquid fire who drank;<br>
Till she, and that she wore, were burnt away<br>
And smoking cinders told of where she lay.
<p>
"Now," said the King, "my sister's heart I see,<br>
For that swift death was surely meant for me.<br>
How can I rest in peace, or ride secure,<br>
While any of her part around me be?<br>
Though (to King Urience now he spake) I know<br>
Thou art not of her kind nor she to thee<br>
Her favour gives, for Accolon, ere he died,<br>
Confessed that with my death for thine beside<br>
She practiced...... But thy son is hers also.<br>
I will not wrong him with a proofless slur,<br>
But lest of natural blood he hold to her,<br>
I will that distant from the court he ride,<br>
Until fair deeds his loyal heart shall show."
<p>
Said Urience: "While that smoking ash we see,<br>
I may not urge thee, though I count Ewaine<br>
Gentle to all, and wholly bound to thee." 
<p>
"Nay," said Gawain, "but I alike will go.<br>
For he is natured, as a child should know,<br>
No evil to devise, or wrong sustain."<br>
Nor would he pause the king's quick wrath to stay,<br>
But at his cousin's side he rode away.
<p>
"For doubt of one we take the loss of two,"<br>
Gaheris said: "and, save, the king, were few<br>
But of Ewaine's fair faith were confident."
<p>
To which the king gave answer: "Think ye so?<br>
So may I alike, yet not my word repent.<br>
For if untouched by any taint he be<br>
Of treason either to my throne or me,<br>
Then will he wander in wild lands afar<br>
Where strange great scenes and many ventures are,<br>
Meeting occasions to advance his name,<br>
And making for ourselves from whence he came,<br>
A more reputed and a farther fame;<br>
And only if his heart to treason stir<br>
Will he ride backward to her hold and her."
