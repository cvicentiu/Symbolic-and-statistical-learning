     <div class="entry_title">Excalibur</div>
   




  
     <P>The next morning Morgan woke not know where she was. Then she smelt the cooking&nbsp; breakfast and she realised she was home but with the warmth and comfort feeling came the feeling of dread from the night before. She rolled out of bed and looked in her suitcase for something to wear and then went down stairs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;It was as though nothing had happened last night, her mother was helping Lara the cook to do breakfast and Arthur had his nose in the morning paper.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Ah Morgan come and sit Lara and I have cooked you breakfast.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘There was no need mother.’ Morgan whispered </P>
<P>Her mother bustled around her placing a plate of a full English Breakfast&nbsp;in front of her. </P>
<P>'Don’t be silly child you need all the strength you can get, why I remember when I was carrying Arthur…’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘MOTHER!!!! ‘ Arthur slammed the paper down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan mumbled her thanks and kept her eyes on her plate and tried to keep the food in her stomach. She could feel Arthur’s eyes watching her but when she looked he looked away, their mother watched her intently and Morgan could feel that something had been discussed without her knowledge and the time bomb was ticking away whilst she ate. When finally her plate was taken from her. Her mother sat near her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I’ve been in touch with your father’s sister Anna. You know the one? Well anyway we've been talking of your predicament and we re all in agreement.' Giving Arthur a meaningful nod. 'That it would be best for the baby to be fostered maybe&nbsp;even adopted with them.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Her mother breathed deeply as though she was scared shed not get it all out fast enough. Morgan stared open mouthed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I can’t believe this. What about what I want? Does it not occur to you that I want this baby?’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘But Morgan dear think about the lives you can ruin. The child will want for nothing in Anna’s home I assure you.’ Her mother said calmly yet her lips had turned white a sign that she was getting mad. Morgan stood and leant very close to her mother. </P>
<P>‘You mean it will ruin your precious son. She hissed. The answer is no.’ </P>
<P>The consequences of saying no were soon clear. When a week later she was sitting alone in a dingy bed sit listening to the thud of loud music above her. </P>
<P>Months passed and a new political party getting into Westminster the leader the youngest leader ever in its history at eighteen dominated soon the news. Theparty pendragon was scaring officials by its popularity but with the backing of the archbishop behind them it wasn’t long before the party gained power and Arthur was prime Minster of Britain. </P>
<P>The celebration afterward was a grand affair. Morgan spotted her mother, Arthur and his new wife Gwen stood in the middle of well wishers. Morgan held her head up high as she walked towards them. Gwen looked first and a smile formed on her lips as she went to embrace her. Which caught Morgan off guard. </P>
<P>‘Sister where have you been. Arthur said you just left. How’s the baby?’ her smile sickenly sweet</P>
<P>. ‘I’m fine Gwen but am I able to speak to Arthur on his own’. Arthur and mother joined them both looking very nervous which gave her a sense of power, which she was beginning to like.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘May I then?’ She said to Arthur. ‘Speak to you alone it is important.’ </P>
<P>She was ushered by her mother and Arthur in to plush and richly decorated room, which curiously noticed held in the middle a large ornate round table with thirteen chairs around it. </P>
<P>‘Well Morgan what is it? Do you know how important this night is to us?’ Her mother said haughtily. Morgan caught a look of annoyance from Arthur at their mother.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘ Let her speak mother.’ Arthur said smiling at Morgan </P>
<P>‘Well.’ Morgan began.’ These last months have been increasingly difficult after been made to live in squalor and this has made me realise that maybe you was right. Ive been in regular contact with Anna and she as agreed that she is to foster and to only foster my child until i’m able to get my life back on track.’ </P>
<P>Arthur sank down in to a chair. ‘Are you sure this is what you want?’ He asked</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Of course its what she wants and what you need you and Gwen can start your own family together.’ Her mother said. Then looking at Morgan. ‘I knew you’d come to your senses. ‘ </P>
<P>‘Well it’s surprising what happens when forced to’ she threw at her mother. Her mother snorted and left the room. </P>
<P>‘I best go too.’ Morgan said emptily and she went to leave. But as leaving she heard viviannes voice, she slipped back in and hid near some heavy drapes. Morgan caught a glimpse of her grandfather and another young man who seemed to be his apprentice. Arthur looked suddenly drained but still her got up and greeted them all with politeness. </P>
<P>‘You know why we are she don’t you?’ Merlin said Arthur merely nodded ‘Well you made a pact a promise with the lady Vivienne for all you have here now. You must do something for us, that was the deal.’ </P>
<P>Merlin smiled and patted Arthur on his back. ‘ No worries boy you will do us proud. But to secure that you stay in power and do your duty we must give you this.’ </P>
<P>Morgan saw him hand what looked like a small dagger in the shape of a sheath and inside was a silver and gold fountain pen. Morgan gave a small gasp the pen and its sheath was Excalibur the first thing she was given to enchant and charm it took three full moons to complete, it gives the owner a special power one every world leader would kill for. But! It would only write for its true blood&nbsp;owner. She herself charmed it that way. The room began to fill with more people and Morgan saw her chance and left. </P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">Morgan goes home</div>
   




  
     <P>The house had not changed all those years except it looked like the house was full of people and laughter something that never happened when Malcolm was alive. Morgan raised a hand to knock when a voice came from behind her</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Excuse me but is this where I can find Arthur?’&nbsp; Morgan turned, to be faced with a face of pure beauty. </P>
<P>‘I think so, ive been away for a while ‘ She stammered blushing slightly</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Me too I haven’t seen him since our school days. I hope im welcome. My names lance.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;He held out his hand to her </P>
<P>‘Morgan his half sister im not expected either’ They both laughed at each other. </P>
<P>‘Well Morgan if you don’t mind we’ll go in together it seems we are better going through the back as that’s where all the noise is coming from.’ He held out his hand and has she grabbed his arm she felt a sudden surge of electricity run through her body. Don’t be foolish what would he see in a pregnant woman.&nbsp;she told herself </P>
<P>As they moved into the back of the house the party became louder. Lance pushed open the gate and the party stopped to stare. </P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Morgan is that you?’&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur came towards her to embrace her acting as though Beltane had never happened, but he stopped and paled when his eyes fell to her stomach.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I hope i've not come at a bad time i’ve actually come to see mother is she here?’ </P>
<P>‘Yes she’s in the house. Help yourself’</P>
<P>&nbsp;She noted how his eyes couldn’t look at her but she didn’t really care all she wanted was to see her mother. She walked in to the house and caught a glimpse of Arthur and lance embracing as old friends did. She couldn’t help but feel envious she did not have friends or anyone in fact that she was close to. </P>
<P>Her mother was sitting talking to a pretty young girl. Both were deep in conversation until her mother looked up and gasped in surprise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Hello mother. I hope i’m not intruding’ Her mother got up and wrapped her arms around her </P>
<P>‘Not at all you should have called I would have had someone pick you up. Is vivianne with you?’ Her mother asked looking past her. </P>
<P>‘No she’s not i’ve come alone.’ She watched her mothers eyes move as Arthur’s done to her stomach and noted her mothers sudden curl of the lip which vanished as soon as appear. </P>
<P>‘So Morgan when did this happen? you should of told me I was to be a grandmother’ She said excitedly which Morgan knew was for the benefit for the girl who was sat looking curiously at her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Bel…. I mean I met someone in may mother but he went away as soon as and now i’ve come to spend some time with my mother if that’s ok.’ She said holding out her bags. </P>
<P>‘Yes yes child that’s fine your room is still as it is.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Both women fell silent not knowing what to say until the girl coughed. </P>
<P>‘Oh my dear i’m so sorry Morgan this is Gwen. Arthur’s fiancée you’ve just turned up at a little celebration.’ Morgan felt a sudden rush of jealously but didn’t understand why.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Hello Gwen, i’m sorry to have just barged in’ She held out her hand and to her surprise the girl gathered her up in a warm embrace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Don’t be silly any sister of Arthurs is a sister of mine.’ Morgan could not help but like her but there was still this tug of jealously that she could not shake off. </P>
<P>That night when the last guest had gone home. Morgan approached her mother. </P>
<P>‘You are disappointed in me?’ Her mother turned and motioned her to sit with her. </P>
<P>‘Today has been a happy day lets leave it at that. What’s done is done and can be soon fixed.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan looked at her mother puzzled what did she mean can soon be fixed</P>
<P>. ‘I met Merlin whilst I was at the coven.’ Morgan said trying to change the subject </P>
<P>‘Merlin!!! Nothing but a foolish old man with old ideas.’ Her mother hissed</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘He was the one who&nbsp;convinced me to come home’</P>
<P>&nbsp;She noted a smile form on her mothers face </P>
<P>‘Must off been one of his good days’ And with that she got up and left Morgan sitting alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;She sat looking out at the stars; the feeling of homesickness was starting to catch up with her. She had not realised how secluded her life had been inside the coven and how life had changed so much without her. She got up to go to her room and started when she saw Arthur’s’ shadow enter the garden. </P>
<P>‘Where’s mum?’ He asked </P>
<P>‘She’s gone to bed I think.’ Replied Morgan feeling uncomfortable being alone with him again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘May I?’ Morgan nodded as he sat down next to her. They both sat there silent not know what to say. but feeling questions floating like bees around their heads. </P>
<P>‘Can I just congratulate you on your engagement Gwen seems nice ‘ Morgan said breaking the silence first.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Yes she is her father was an old friend of the family you know the archbishop of Canterbury she’s his granddaughter. We are to be married in six weeks. ‘</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Six weeks! What’s the rush?’ </P>
<P>‘I’ve been involved in a new political party and i’m hoping to stand for parliament so the quicker the better.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan huffed in surprise </P>
<P>‘So you are marring for convenience I thought in this day in age you married through choice and love.’ </P>
<P>‘You!!! Talking about this day in age when you’ve been living the life in some coven learning medieval beliefs.’ Arthur threw back clearly annoyed at her mocking. </P>
<P>Morgan rose before her temper got the better of her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Morgan look i’m sorry please sit down.’ Arthur grabbed her hand. Morgan sat. </P>
<P>‘Why don’t you just ask me?’ she said finally.</P>
<P>&nbsp;He began to play with his hands a trait she remembered he used to do as a child and she felt her heart softening to him as he started to look like the lost little boy she knew.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I just need to know about the baby.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘What do you need to know?’ </P>
<P>‘Come on Morgan don’t play with me I need to know.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Well put it this way you were my first and my only. So what do you think?’ She watched the colour drain from his face as he sank into the chair. </P>
<P>‘Oh god what have we done?’ He mumbled </P>
<P>‘What on earth were you doing there in the first place; you know mother would not of agreed to you joining in pagan festivities.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;It was just one of those stupid things that a group of us suggested and you know what mother says about pagan girls. Never in all my life did I think of you being there. </P>
<P>Morgan felt mad at his prejudice but instead of showing him she put her arms round his shoulders and just sat holding each other trying to make some sense out of the madness. When she became aware of another presence. She turned to see the drained and disgusted look on her mothers face a face that looked like it had aged twenty years since earlier on in the day. Arthur shot up. </P>
<P>‘Mum how long have you been up?’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Long enough’. She whispered.’ Would someone tell me what’s going on here?’ </P>
<P>Morgan felt she no longer knew how to talk the words were refusing to unstuck from her dry throat </P>
<P>‘I was enquiring about the father of my future nephew.’ Arthur said going towards is mother to hug her. </P>
<P>‘Don’t you lie to me.’ She hissed. ‘I heard everything don’t take me for a fool. I heard.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘What did you hear?’ Arthur asked trying to sound as light hearted as possible. </P>
<P>‘You were her first and only. YOU were your sisters first and only and now she’s pregnant.’ She started to shriek. ‘Now tell me I misheard.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I think its best I go.’ Morgan offered</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘No you damn well wont.’ Gerna yelled. ‘I just cannot believe Ive been punished bringing two unworldly evil creatures into the world.’ And with that she ran in to the house followed by a slamming of a door. Morgan looked at Arthur helplessly but he turned and went in to the house leaving her with the feeling of dread and humiliation.</P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">Merlyn</div>
   




  
     <P>Finally the day of Morgan’s initiation was here she was supposed to fast and be in deep meditation through the day but because of her present condition she was exempt from the a fasting but it did not stop her from skipping breakfast in the large hall to be on her own. The autumn air hit her as she stepped out the smell of fires burning with the smell of the fresh autumn air always gave Morgan a sense of warmth and comfort she loved this time of year.</P>
<P>&nbsp;As she walked into the gardens towards the nearby woodland she heard another set of footsteps behind her she turned to be greeted by her grandfather. </P>
<P>‘It seems we both had the same idea although I wouldn’t advise you to be skipping breakfast at this time; you need your strength. ‘ </P>
<P>Morgan smiled &nbsp;‘I couldn’t bear to be with anyone at this time I prefer my own company’ </P>
<P>‘Well would you mind the company of an old man?’ </P>
<P>Morgan nodded and they both walked in silence in to the woods after a while they came to the clearing where Morgan had not been since Beltane. She started to feel herself drift and before she knew what was happening she was been lowered on to a fallen tree.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I told you it wasn’t a good idea skipping breakfast’ . Her grandfather said his smile remaining on his face but his eyes full of concern. </P>
<P>‘I’m fine now thank you grandfather.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Well let’s start this properly no more grandfathers ok; call me Merlyn.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan laughed feeling safe in his company </P>
<P>‘Ids like to say something that I hope will not offend’ He continued,’ but I feel you and I are both the same.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;Morgan looked at him questionably.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘You are to be initiated into the ladies light tonight. A coven if im not mistaken. Where you participate as a group?’ </P>
<P>‘And??’ &nbsp;Morgan asked wondering what he was getting at. </P>
<P>‘My point is your direction is different now to what your aunt had planned for you. You are now finding you prefers to work by yourself. Your goals and beliefs are different from your sisters. And now you have to ask yourself is do you want to be initiated into a group you question.’ </P>
<P>Morgan gasped he seemed to be reading her most inner thoughts, how did he know all this? Did he see it in her eyes? </P>
<P>'You have to do what your heart tells you, after all that’s what your mother did when she married your father and then Malcolm.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘How?’ Exclaimed Morgan with staggered surprise. </P>
<P>‘I know Vivanne has this ideal that you will be her heir but you and I both know that’s not where your heading.’ </P>
<P>Morgan’s heart was pounding like a run away train how could he know so much about her feelings and her dreams. But he was so right these past couple of months she felt unable to breathe in the walls of the house and the structured life of a sister she was screaming to break out but guilt and loyalty and kept her there. So now Merlin was right she had to break out and she needed to do it now tonight. That night as dark fell from the heavens Morgan gathered a small bag of personal belongings and slipped out of the house everyone she knew was preparing for the initiation of the new sisters so she would not be missed until it was too late. She took one long last look at the house that had become her home where she had been the most happiest until recently and she gave silent thanks to those she owed who’d taught her all she knew then with a deep breath that came from the soles of her feet she turned and walked away from the live shed known. .</P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">Vivianne returns</div>
   




  
     <P>The months passed and there was no sign of Viviane in the house anywhere, but there were changes happening to Morgan that she wished were not. Her monthly bleed had been replaced by a sickness and heaviness in her stomach and though Morgan tried to get on with her daily chores and studies she felt eyes watching her and pointing at the sudden growth that was beginning to form slowly inside. Shed dare not look at herself anymore and ignored the slight stirrings that were starting to happen inside and she soon found herself staying alone in her room reading and writing rather then joining in with the others. October came and Morgan was sitting in a room reading the ritual for her coming initiation when a knock came on her door it was a one of the older women Morgan could never remember her name but her kind face looked a familiar 'Ë&#156;Excuse me Morgan but The Lady has requested to see you '</P>
<P> Morgans heart jumped in to her mouth, she was here? This was the moment shed been waiting for months 'Thank you'She managed to say. </P>
<P>She got up and followed the woman out to the stairs. Morgan stared hard at the carpet as she mounted the stairs each step feeling harder and heavier then the last. She  could feel her anger boil as the door came into sight, would she have the courage to say all she need to say to her. atlast the door was in front of her she suddenly realised that that the grain in the door looked like mother with child, how significant she smiled bitterly. </P>
<P>'Morgan please comes in '</P>
<P> Morgan blinked she realised shed been stood intensely looking at the image with her hand holding the doorknob. She stepped into the room to greet Viviane sitting in her usual place near the fire as though shed never been away. </P>
<P>'Sit child' </P>
<P>Morgan sat down in the big chair opposite it was then she realised there was another presence in the room, she looked in to the corner of the rooms partially hidden in the shadows was an old man, his long white hair and beard fell over his long tired face but even though man was at least seventy or eighty the presence of this man was overwhelming. </P>
<P>'I'm so sorry ive been away so long I didn't really want to be as long as I was but matters outside this house had to be dealt with.'</P>
<P> Morgan's eyes left the man and settled on the face of her aunt. It never ceased to amaze Morgan how this woman's eyes were the only things to age on her. </P>
<P>'I must admit the im disappointed to hearyou've been neglecting your studies as well as your sisters, some say you've been come recluse and at times refuse to leave your room.'</P>
<P>The fire inside that had been building up all these months was beginning reaching its peak. </P>
<P>'The Lady I am to understand will not only listen to group of singing and chanting but will also hear the lone heart crying out to her if its sincere enough so there for as long as my thoughts and prayers are with her there is no need for me to be others.'</P>
<P> Vivanne's face twitched slightly, and a chuckle came from the corner of the room as the man moved into the light </P>
<P>'Well Vivienne you were right she is most definitely a Fae'</P>
<P> Viviane composed herself and smiled at Morgan</P>
<P>Ë&#156;You've been given a great gift why do you hide it and treat as though it was a curse.'</P>
<P> Morgan stood up with such force that Viviane paled slightly. Her hands were clenched so hard in an effort to stop her losing control. </P>
<P>'It is a goddamn curse the father is of all people my brother'</P>
<P> 'Should it matter who the father is ? it's you and the child that matters to us now.'</P>
<P> Viviane replied grabbing for Morgan's hand. Morgan pulled away </P>
<P>'What do you mean,?' she hissed The old man came towards her and took her in his arms and led her to the chair to sit down </P>
<P>'Viviane is only doing what she needs to do, your son has been chosen already for a great destiny and even though it may sound terrible now for the good of the future this was the only way. I know you feel betrayed and tricked but you aunt is right you have been blessed I beg of you to embrace it and love him.'</P>
<P> Morgan finally began to feel some weight start to be lifted off her his voice ran through her like a warm wave and eyes were very much like Viviane's but with more warmth and wisdom. </P>
<P>'Your aunt and your mother were very much like you when they were younger no matter what I did for them or taught them they both knew better and in your mothers case she turned her back on me to follow her heart and her church and I still hold no ill to her because she did was right for her. As you will, no doubt.'</P>
<P> Morgan seemed to snap awake atthat moment as the face in front of her became more familiar to her </P>
<P>'Grandfather??'</P>
<P> 'Yes.'He chuckled. 'Ë&#156;I am and that child is to be my great grandchild. He is destined to bring together the church and the old ways in an amicable union.'</P>
<P> 'Is that possible?' Morgan said in disbelief the idea seemed so farfetched. </P>
<P>'It will be.'  Viviane broke in. ' Arthur has be pursuing a career in politics since college he has formed a new party called pendragon your grandfather and I have both been with him encouraging him introducing to the right people to get him the votes and the seats he needs to get him at least in to Westminster. With the right pushes he will get into power and we can make the changes through him.'</P>
<P>'But why should he help you are you forgetting Malcolm and my mother were Christians.' Morgan asked feeling her heart beat fast at the mention of Arthurs name</P>
<P> 'Because Morgan he gave him an offer he could not refuse. Now I want you to go and rest its your initiation tomorrow and I want you well for that.'</P>
<P>Morgan stood and smiled at her grandfather </P>
<P>'Thank you' she said to him. And not wanting to forgive Vivianne so easily she walked out of the room without looking at her. In her room Morgan sat thinking long and hard at what had been said to her, she was to have a son, it was the first time shed even acknowledged the growth inside as a child and for the first time in months she pulled at the cloth covering her mirror and stood and looked at her reflection. Her face had paled and worn with all the stress and worry but underneath it all was the warmth and glow that came with a mother to be. The lump began to move inside and she started to laugh and cry at the same time, she pulled off her dress and stood looking at her stomach that was nearing its capacity she was sure. Again another kick and this time she ran her hand over a stomach and did what her grandfather told her and embraced her unborn son. .</P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">The Sacred Marriage</div>
   




  
     <P>A month into her stay she was called up to her aunt’s room. Morgan had been having bad dreams about her family for the last couple of weeks and she wondered as she walked to the door whether her aunt already knew this and was about to put her mind at rest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Sit down Morgan. How are things? Your tutors tell me they are impressed with your studies.’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Things are fine lady we are learning about the burning times’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘Yes a terrible but an important time.’ There was a sudden pause that hung in the air like a thick fog and Morgan’s inside began to churn with dread and anticipation ‘Malcolm has passed away im afraid, and im afraid your mother has not taken it so well and has had to have Arthur taken in to care ‘ Again another pause ‘Morgan how do you feel’</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘I bless my mother and Arthur with her ladies light as for Malcolm have no feeling for him. ‘ Viviane smiled ‘You’ve grown up so much in this month im proud of your answer; you may now resume.’ </P>
<P>Morgan’s teachings began to progress, she learned how to communicate with the other world through meditation and her spells and rituals seemed to come to her like a second nature. The years came and passed and soon Morgan was facing her twentieth birthday and her first Beltane festival. Beltane was a festival of fire and strongly associated with fertility when the goddess and her consort the horned god joined together to create the fertile land. It was also about young love and laughter when young lovers came together to celebrate their union. In the ladies light girls of over twenty and those who were not training for the ladies hand maiden were allowed to join in as of before that they were to live as virgins in the face of the lady. So this time Morgan was allowed to join in and her nerves were starting to get the better of her. After all she had lived with only women for the past ten years and had no male company since the last night at her mothers home. The fires outside were burning bright and fiercely the smell of the smoke hitting her throat making her eyes water. She sat at her mirror and arranged her makeup and headdress, this was to be her first sexual contact and the thought of it made her excited and physically sick. She closed her eyes and whispered a silent prayer to the goddess then took a deep breath and made her way to the festivities. The gardens and surrounding woodland was full of both young and old laughing and screaming at each other. Shebegan to feel dizzy and felt her nerve go but as she turned toleave a hand grabbed hers she turned to see bright blue eyes staring out of heavy makeup his head was covered in greenery and horns, she knew what she should do shed read the ritual and practise over and over again she’d been chosen and her horned god had to give chase and catch her. She ran hard and fast the floor of the woods were ripping her bare feet to shreds but some unseen force was pressing, pushing her on the trees and the air was coming to life in front of her as she jumped over fallen logs and running brooks. Eventually she found herself in a clearing, she stopped her chest heaving with pain as she tried to catch her breath. There was nothing .all she could hear was she and the trees in the wind. Maybe he got lost or he gave up and found an easy game, she knew she wasn’t as beautiful as some of the other girls but still a sudden stab of disappointment started to sting her eyes when suddenly she was pushed to the floor by a heavy weight. She caught the look in the same blue eyes and all her fears and insecurities were gone. Morgan opened her eyes and felt the same strong arms around her she smiled her heart telling her she had found love but her head also telling she had no idea who this boy was. As she stirred so did he, both their makeup and worn off in the night and now they both looked at each other for the first time. Those blue eyes and blond hair looked so familiar to her but she couldn’t place him, yet his eyes were wide with shock and disgust. ‘Oh my god what have I done what have we done.’ Morgan felt like she was being kicked over and over surely she wasn’t that bad</P>
<P>&nbsp;‘ Morgan it is Morgan isn’t it’ He cried Suddenly the eyes, the hair and the voice flew at her like a sickening force. Uther. She got herself together not daring to believe that it was her own half brother sitting there surely this cant have been allowed to happen. She started to run leaving him there, she finally made it back to the house running up to Viviane’s room only to find it locked, she banged and kicked the door in frustration till one of the other ladies came out and told her she had gone away and wouldn’t be back for at least six months, Morgan flew to her own room and hurled herself on her bed hoping with all her might that the bed would swallow her up and take her far away from this terrible mess.</P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">An Angel</div>
   




  
     <P>Morgan did not understand the whys and wherefores but withen in the week of her confrontation with Malcom she found herself travelling with Vivianne to Glastenbury.</P>
<P>The journey was long and tiring but adrenaline kept Morgan going ,the not knowing what was going to happen to her and what was expected of her.</P>
<P>It was late dusk when their car pulled into a long winding driveway.In front beyond all the trees Morgan caught a glimpse of the place she was to call home. It looked almost like a castle its high ivy covered walls gave it a forboding look&nbsp; but once inside the warm wooden intrerior made Morgan feel warm and safe. </P>
<P>Vivianne led the way up a flight of stairs the plush carpet felt like springs under Moragns feet. Then they stopped infront of a huge wooden door which looked like no hell on earth could move it,yet vivianne pushed it with ease and grace.</P>
<P>Viviannes room was like nothing Morgan had ever seen before in one corner was a large four poster oak bed with heavy rich drapes , in the other corner was a desk full of papaers and books and striaght ahead was a large open fire with two large armchairs in front.</P>
<P>Vivianne indicated to Morgan to sit.</P>
<P>'Now Morgan first i'd like to welcome you to my home which is now also yours. I know you are very tired but there are a few things I need to clear with you first.'</P>
<P>Morgan nodded.</P>
<P>'You are now part of a group of ladies known as The Ladies Light&nbsp; you will train to be priestess as I and all the other girls have done. you will learn to works and the magick of the world around you and most of all you will honour the greatest lady of all. When you come of age at twenty you will become a fully intiated Priestess and will carry one the work I have started.'</P>
<P>Morgan felt aheavy lump in her throat she had no idea what her aunt was asking of her but somehow she knew it was right and she would be fine.</P>
<P>' Morgan how do you feel?' Vivianne asked her eyes looking concerned</P>
<P>'I'm fine. I dont really understand but I'm fine' Morgan answered.</P>
<P>Vivianne smiled ' well let me show you to your room.'.</P>
<P>Morgans room was nothing like she expected it was simlar to Viviannes but alot simpler but still she found it hard to hide her tears of joy, she turned round and grabbed the one true angel who had come and saved her life.</P><br>

     <div class="entry_title">The visit cont...</div>
   




  
     <P>Later that night as the house slept her Vivianne came into her room and sat on her bed. Morgan was still feeling sore after the eveings events but in her aunts presence she felt nothing but calm.</P>
<P>'I didn't mean to upset you at dinner.and I'm sorry if I did'</P>
<P>Morgan merely nodded the loyalty to her mother even now kept her quiet. Vivianne smiled and pulled a chain from around her neck which held a star.</P>
<P>'Morgan do you know what this represents?' vivianne asked.</P>
<P>Morgan shook her head to her it was just a star.</P>
<P>'Its a sign of my people and our beleifs. It represents the four elements that make our world complete Earth, Air , Fire and Water.' Vivianne continued.</P>
<P>Morgan frowned 'But thats only four there are five points.'</P>
<P>'Nothing gets past you .you are right the fifth is spirit the connection that binds us all.' Vivianne laughed.</P>
<P>'And who are your people are you a queen?'</P>
<P>'No my child I am merely part of something that is much bigger. Im the leader of a group of ladies and young girls who beleive in the Great Goddess and her consort The God'</P>
<P>'But aunt there is only one god'</P>
<P>with that Vivianne laughed even more.</P>
<P>'Here is a book to read something I was given as a child, I have a feeling that you are ready and able to understand it.</P>
<P>And read it she, did all her questions seemed to be answered. It talked about the faerie folk and how to see and speak to them. How to use and apreciate the world around her. And she felt atlast she'd found something that had some meaning. Until.</P>
<P>'Morgan what in Gods name is this?'</P>
<P>her mother shreaked holding the book in one hand and a glass of Gin in the other.</P>
<P>' I can not believe that woman would dare come into my house and try to brainwash my child' </P>
<P>She continued.&nbsp;The&nbsp;ice in the glass clinking as she paced the room. It had been a long to time since her mother had referred to her that way and it sent prickles down the back of Morgans&nbsp;neck.</P>
<P>Of course Malcom was told and&nbsp;Morgan felt numb with fear as his shadow filled&nbsp;her doorway.</P>
<P>'Get up you ungrateful child' he boomed.</P>
<P>Morgan could not move. </P>
<P>' I said get up' he yelled grabbing her by the arm '&nbsp;After all&nbsp;your mother and I have done for you&nbsp;this is how you repay us.&nbsp;Well young lady&nbsp;I will not tolerate a Witch in my household ever'</P>
<P>'Well you tolerated one when Aunt Vivianne stayed'</P>
<P>She knew with all her heart she should have kept quiet but he'd stirred something up inside her. something that wanted to show him she was no longer going to be the quiet little girl that hid in the background, and before she knew it his hand stung her face before finding herself being thrown into a heap.</P>
<P>'MALCOM!!!' </P>
<P>her mothers voice saved her.</P>
<P>'She is only ten maybe we could talk to Father&nbsp;Callum he may be able to help'</P>
<P>'The child is hardly worth it' Malcom hissed before turning away and leaving&nbsp;her room in darkness.</P>
<P>Then as the darkness engulfed her someone inside ordered the dam in her&nbsp;eyes to be blown as the&nbsp;gush of tears rolled down her face. silently but not unheard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

     <div class="entry_title">The visit</div>
   




  
     <P><FONT size=2>Then when she was ten years old a visit form an aunt changed her life altogether.Morgan stared at the wondourous creature that stood in her mothers hallway not beleiving for one second that her mother and her were actually related to this angelic beauty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Her hair was slightly darker then her mothers and where her mothers face held a tightness,her aunts face was warm and friendly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' vivianne welcome how was your journey ?' her mother asked.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'it was pleasent long but pleasent' Vivianne replied. Then turning to Morgan ' My how much you have grown'</FONT></P>
<P>Morgan found herself startled it was very rare anyone who visited paid any notice to her it had always been Arthur who got the attention and now she had it she felt a warm glow build up inside her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' You've not met Arthur, my youngest ' her mother interuptted</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' No I haven't he looks just like his father' she replied keeping her eyes firmly on Morgan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Vivianne your here let me fix you a drink' Malcom boomed as he pushed his way through.</P>
<P>Morgan noticed that in a flash those warm eyes of her aunts turn suddenly icy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thankyou that would be nice' she said and followed in into the lounge.</P>
<P>Later that eveing they all sat to dinner coversation was strained but light until vivianne mentioned her mother visiting home.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 'Gernas place is here with Arthur and I' Malcom said</P>
<P>'Arthur and you? wheres Morgan in this arrangment?' vivianne asked calmy putting down her knife and fork.</P>
<P>Morgan could feel electricity in the air as though she was about to witness a major power stuggle.</P>
<P>'Well this is Morgans home aswell but she will be going to boarding school in a year so her home will be there.' Malcom replied obviously uncomfortable with his mistake and Vivannes deep stare.</P>
<P>Morgan felt like her stomach had turned to lead he was going to succeed. he was finally have to house Fae free and at that momment she hated her mother for just sitting there accepting his every word.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

     <P>Morgan sat on the top stair clutching her favourate teddy close to her chest, begging with all her might that some one might make it stop. Her mother and father had been arguing for almost and hour and it had been the sound of smashing crockery that had woken her from her slumber. Her father she could hear was shouting at her mother asking her how she had got pregnant when they both knew he could not have anymore children, and her mother pleading her inocence and that accidants could happen.</P>
<P>Morgan at her young age could not understand what they were saying but she knew that some thing was wrong very very wrong and it pained her to hear them fighting like they were.Then suddenly a scream pierced the air and Morgan jumped up in fright and ran towards it not know or expecting the sight she was aprroaching, her mother was stood howling like a banshee her face red raw with tears and her eyes wide with fear and there on the floor her fathers blue face as he stuggled to keep life withen him.</P>
<P>Her mother told her later that her father had had a poorly heart and that he had gone on to meet god in heaven, and she soon&nbsp;found herself leaving the home she loved to live with 'mummys'new friend'&nbsp; Malcom Uther.</P>
<P>She hated him on sight he seemed not ever to want her around as though her presence was an inconvienance and when the house began to fill with new baby things she noticed her mother started to distance herself from her aswell.</P>
<P>Then one day the house was full of well wishers and family to welcome the new arrival her new baby brother Arthur and again Morgan found herself sitting on the stairs being ignored and feeling jealousy and sadness settling in.</P>
<P>As the years past she found herself able to amuse herself&nbsp; often welcoming the fact her mother and Malcom would render her invisable. She knew she was different from them she didnt know how or why she knew deep down in her soul she was different and sometimes she would catch her mother looking at her with great sadness in her eyes as though she would give anything to embrace her, but instead would turn to Arthur and hug him instead.</P>
