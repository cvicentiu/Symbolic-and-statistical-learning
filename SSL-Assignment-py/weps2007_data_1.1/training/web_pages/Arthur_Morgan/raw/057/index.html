        Father of Public Power</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660000">Boyish 
        in appearance but hardheaded and knowledgeable, David Lilienthal built 
        the TVA power system according to one guiding principle: affordable power 
        for everyone in the Tennessee Valley.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When people met TVA&#146;s 
        three original Directors, he was the one who looked out of place. Two 
        of the triumvirate were white-haired academics. The third, and the last 
        to join, was not yet 34&#151;more than 20 years younger than either of 
        his colleagues.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He looked even younger 
        than that. During his first days at TVA in 1933, David Lilienthal was 
        sometimes mistaken for an office boy. His youthful appearance belied his 
        extensive experience and accomplishments.</font></p>

              Tennessee Valley owes its network of municipal and cooperative power 
              distributors to the vision of David Lilienthal, one of TVA&#146;s 
              three original directors.</font></div>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Born in the back 
        of a small-town grocery store in Morton, Illinois, the son of a struggling 
        Jewish family, Lilienthal grew up in Indiana with dreams of being a writer. 
        He attended DePauw University, graduated when he was only 20, and went 
        on to Harvard Law School. As a young lawyer he handled cases for the city 
        of Chicago and, still in his twenties, developed a reputation for having 
        a comprehensive understanding of public utility problems.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Through his litigation 
        work for the city, Lilienthal came to believe there were some services 
        so essential to modern day-to-day living that they must be made available 
        and affordable for everyone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In concert with other 
        lawyers he helped win for the public a famous telephone rate case, Smith 
        v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, which required a 600-page brief and 
        arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1931 he established and became 
        the first director of the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation; that same 
        year, he organized the Wisconsin Railroad Commission. His name began to 
        be known across the country.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Appropriately enough 
        for the man who&#146;d be responsible for building so many reservoirs 
        in the Tennessee Valley, the call to national service came by rowboat. 
        Lilienthal was fishing on a lake in upper Wisconsin when a messenger rowed 
        out to the island where he was staying and told him he had an urgent long-distance 
        call from Arthur Morgan, the new Chairman of TVA. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the phone in his 
        fishing gear, the flabbergasted Lilienthal had the first of many arguments 
        with Morgan. He found the job prospect exciting, he said, but he was on 
        vacation and preferred to meet with Morgan sometime the following week. 
        Informing Lilienthal that President Roosevelt himself had insisted that 
        the two men meet as soon as possible, Morgan carried his point. They got 
        together in Chicago the next day.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With Morgan, Lilienthal 
        was frank about what he saw as his own shortcomings, especially his limited 
        knowledge of engineering and his lack of a personal connection to the 
        South. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But both Morgan and 
        FDR knew that Lilienthal&#146;s grasp of the way public utilities worked 
        was excelled nowhere in the country. And having met him, Morgan was impressed 
        by his forthrightness&#151;though that quality would come back to haunt 
        the Chairman. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lilienthal was given 
        the responsibility of organizing TVA&#146;s power system. He took his 
        family to Tennessee, eventually moving into a modest house in the new 
        TVA company town of Norris. One of his neighbors, not a five-minute walk 
        away, was Arthur Morgan himself. But by the time Lilienthal settled in 
        Norris, the two weren&#146;t getting along. They&#146;d been fighting 
        practically ever since Lilienthal arrived at TVA.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Privately, Lilienthal 
        was something of a romantic. He was still an aspiring writer. He kept 
        a personal diary and worried about crying at his children&#146;s high 
        school graduations. But next to Arthur Morgan, an aging college president 
        with dreams of utopia, he seemed very much the hardheaded lawyer that 
        he was in public.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Arthur Morgan wanted 
        TVA to be little less than his own personal reinvention of Western civilization. 
        Lilienthal thought that providing affordable power to all the people of 
        the Valley should be the agency&#146;s first priority. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This clash of personalities 
        came to a head over TVA&#146;s power policy. Chairman Morgan proposed 
        that TVA enter into an agreement with the private utilities to distribute 
        its power. Lilienthal the lawyer didn&#146;t trust the private power companies; 
        he felt that public power should be distributed publicly, through a network 
        of local municipal power boards and rural co-ops. Lilienthal won the fight 
        in 1938, when FDR fired his original Chairman.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Harcourt Morgan, 
        the third TVA Board member (he was no relation to Arthur) became Chairman 
        but held the post for only three years. In 1941, at the age of 75, he 
        elected to step down and recommended that his young colleague Lilienthal 
        be chosen to replace him.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With the United States 
        on the brink of a world war, it was a crucial time and place, as Lilienthal 
        understood. The federal government needed more energy for its war-effort 
        industries, several of which were located in TVA&#146;s power service 
        area. Characteristically, Lilienthal took the reins and spurred TVA to 
        the biggest building boom in its history.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Twelve dams went 
        up during his five-year tenure as Chairman&#151;a feat that has been called 
        the largest engineering and construction project in the history of the 
        U.S., exceeding even the Panama Canal. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lilienthal&#146;s 
        career of public service continued after he left TVA at the end of the 
        war. He had been involved in the siting of the top-secret Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 
        facilities that, driven by TVA power, helped build the atom bomb. Now 
        he directed the State Department&#146;s postwar assessment of nuclear 
        power and advised that control of this enormous force should be international, 
        resting in the hands of no single nation, not even the United States.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Impressed by Lilienthal&#146;s 
        grasp of the subject, President Truman appointed him the first chairman 
        of the Atomic Energy Commission, which managed the peacetime use of nuclear 
        power. Later he served as a consultant and as chairman of the international 
        Development and Resources Corporation, working on projects in Colombia, 
        Peru, Brazil, Iran, and Vietnam.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lilienthal returned 
        to the Valley more than once to reminisce with old friends and talk about 
        the future. His last visit occurred in 1979, 20 months before his death, 
        when he went to Norris for a reunion.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite the turbulent 
        battles with Morgan and the round-the-clock stress of wartime dam-building, 
        TVA had retained a special place in Lilienthal&#146;s heart. He took pride 
        in TVA&#146;s role in the war effort and in its rock-solid dedication 
        to public power. On his final visit, reviewing all the milestones of his 
        adventurous career, he spoke of his 13 years at TVA as &#147;the happiest 
        years of my life.&#148;</font></p>
