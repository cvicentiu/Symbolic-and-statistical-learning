	    <h1>More Morgan</h1>
		<p>

<p>Having completed a tour of the Tennessee Valley and settled down comfortably 
for the summer, Senator Vic Donahey&#39;s TVA investigating committee last 
week got down to work. At Knoxville the committee took up its long 
job by calling to the stand TVA&#39;s deposed chairman, Arthur Ernest 
Morgan. </p><p>During four days of testimony in an air-cooled Federal courtroom, 
zealous Arthur Morgan repeated and amplified the charges he made 
against TVA Directors Harcourt A. Morgan and David E. Lilienthal last 
March. He made it clear that: 1) from the beginning in 1933 he was the 
only one of TVA&#39;s directors who was in step, 2) Franklin Roosevelt was 
fully informed of the Morgan v. Morgan &amp; Lilienthal rift from its 
inception, but did nothing about it until Arthur Morgan publicly 
exploded. Beyond that, Arthur Morgan flooded and occasionally bored 
the committee with details in support of his complaints that the other 
directors shoved him around&#39;, deceived him, the public and the 
President, wasted TVA money, based yardstick rates on spurious or 
nonexistent cost calculations. But if Oldster Arthur Morgan would cut 
no capers to supply entertainment, loud Representative Thomas A. 
Jenkins, a Republican from Ironton, Ohio, made up for the deficiency. </p><p>Last week, when Arthur Morgan testified that the committee&#39;s counsel, 
socialite New Dealer Francis Biddle of Philadelphia, &quot;has informed me 
that I can&#39;t talk to a TVA employe who has not been arranged through 
him.&quot; Representative Jenkins charged into the battle. In the
ensuing exchange of bellows, he asked TVA&#39;s lawyer, James Lawrence Fly: 
&quot;Have you any arrangement with Mr. Biddle whereby you know everything 
they &#91;the employes&#93; tell Dr. Morgan?&quot; </p><p>Biddle: &quot;If these dirty slurs keep up. I&#39;ll resign right now if this 
committee hasn&#39;t got confidence in me.&quot; </p><p>Jenkins: &quot;You&#39;d be doing the committee and the country a great favor if 
you did.&quot; </p><p>To the Congressman&#39;s delight, TVA Employe Charles Hoffman testified that 
he had to forgo a dinner date with his best girl because she used to be 
Arthur Morgan&#39;s secretary, hence might constitute an unauthorized 
&quot;contact.&quot; Upshot was that Dr. Morgan or any other witness designated 
by Senator Donahey may henceforth talk to TVA employes without 
hindrance from TVA bosses. </p><p>Most striking feature of Arthur Morgan&#39;s testimony was his willingness 
to weaken his case rather than tell half-truths. Witness Morgan first 
declared that TVA&#39;s General Manager John Blandford was &quot;one of the 
little clique that run things,&quot; and lacked the background necessary 
for the job. Then Witness Morgan added that he himself hired Mr.
Blandford away from a job as Cincinnati&#39;s public safety director, rued the 
choice later. In the same implacably veracious vein. Arthur Morgan 
pointed out that he: 1) signed board minutes which he now says were 
doctored by David Lilienthal; 2) approved power rates which he now says 
were concocted from guesses by David Lilienthal; 3) approved an 
agreement with land-grant colleges which he now says was cooked up by 
H. A. Morgan. </p><!--pagebreak-->
<p>Before and after Arthur Morgan. Messrs. H. A. Morgan and David
Lilienthal were heard. Said H. A. Morgan: &quot;TVA is a good thing.&quot; Said David 
Lilienthal: &quot;We cut red tape and went right ahead&quot; (to set up TVA&#39;s 
yardstick in 1933). Later studies, he explained, showed that the rates 
he originally hit upon were sound.</p> <!-- Begin Buttons -->
