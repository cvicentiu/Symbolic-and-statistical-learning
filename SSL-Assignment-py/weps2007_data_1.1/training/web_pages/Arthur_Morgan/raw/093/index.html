<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Introductory Note</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">This web site was
created by Fredric Woodbridge Wilson while he was Curator of the
Gilbert and Sullivan Collection at the Pierpont Morgan Library.
Since July 1996 it has not been an official web site of the Morgan
Library, and it is maintained as a service to researchers. Although
some revisions have been made to reflect changes in the collection
and Library services, it is important to contact the Library directly
to confirm the accuracy of information in this web site. Recent
changes have been denoted by the use of square brackets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica"><HR ALIGN="LEFT"></FONT><P></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Description of the
Collection</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Gilbert and Sullivan
Collection is the largest and most comprehensive collection devoted
to the lives and works of the Victorian composer Sir Arthur Seymour
Sullivan (1842-1900), and his collaborator, the dramatist Sir
William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The collection is
intended to serve not only as an archive, a repository for preserving
all genres of original material relating to Gilbert and Sullivan,
but also as a center for the research and documentation of their
personal and professional lives, especially of the bibliographic
history of the printed editions of their works.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Unlike the other
collections in the Pierpont Morgan Library, which are organized
by specific genres, such as drawings, illuminated manuscripts,
children's books, or music manuscripts, the Gilbert and Sullivan
Collection is organized around the subjects of Victorian opera,
theatre, music, and literature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Although, in its
total of some seventy-five thousand individual items, nearly every
possible connection is drawn to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas,
the Library's collection concentrates on the productions and performances
that took place under the direct supervision of the authors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Gilbert and Sullivan
collection is a valuable resource for conductors and stage directors,
costume and scene designers, and textual scholars and bibliographers.
Owing, perhaps, to a heightened general awareness of and interest
in Victorian music and theatre, and in so-called &quot;historically-informed
performance,&quot; the collection is frequently consulted by writers
and researchers, editors and publishers, and historians in diverse
disciplines.</FONT></P>

<I>The Front Entrance to Pierpont Morgan's Library</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Pierpont Morgan
Library in New York City is a public museum and a center for scholarly
research. It originated as the private library of the American
financier J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Beginning in 1890,
Mr. Morgan assembled a magnificent collection of Medieval and
Renaissance manuscripts, rare printed books, fine bindings, autograph
manuscripts, and master drawings, emulating the great libraries
of Europe. (Other portions of his collections are now in other
museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum
of National History, the Wadsworth Athen&aelig;um, in Hartford,
Connecticut, and the Frick Collection.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Within a decade,
Mr. Morgan's holdings required a building of their own. The original
library building, constructed along Madison Avenue next to Mr.
Morgan's town house, was completed in 1906. Designed in the style
of a Renaissance palazzo by the American architect Charles F.
McKim, it is one of New York City's notable landmarks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">In 1924, Pierpont
Morgan's son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., transformed the Library into
a public institution. The Library's collections continue to grow
within the fields established by the founder, and have as their
principal focus the art, literature, and history of Western civilization
from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Beginning in 1968,
the Library's holdings have been enhanced by the formation of
an important collection of music manuscripts based on the collection
of Mary Flagler Cary, donated to the Library from her estate.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">History of the Collection</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Gilbert and Sullivan
Collection originated in the private collection of Reginald Allen
(1905-1988) who brought his collection to the Library in 1949,
and donated it gradually over the next thirty years while serving
as the collection's curator. During that time, the collection
continued to grow through additional donations by Mr. Allen as
well as through Library purchases and gifts from other donors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica"><IMG SRC="ara19502.gif" ALT="Reginald Allen about 1950" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="255" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<I>Reginald Allen, about 1950</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Although, at first,
the scope of the collection was limited solely to the Gilbert
and Sullivan operas, for many years it has included as well the
lives and all of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in their every
manifestation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Mr. Allen retired
from the Pierpont Morgan Library in 1980; Fredric Woodbridge Wilson
assumed curatorial responsibility for the Gilbert and Sullivan
Collection at the end of 1981.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Library continues
to acquire material for its Gilbert and Sullivan Collection. In
recent years, the scope of the collection has broadened somewhat
while its focus has sharpened. The collection includes manuscript
and printed items relating to their closest and most important
contemporaries, and hence is more generally representative of
Victorian opera, theatre, music, and literature. The emphasis
in acquisitions in recent years has been on early editions and
original documents from the nineteenth century rather than material
from more recent material.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">[In the summer of
1996, Mr. Wilson left the Morgan Library to become Curator of
the Harvard Theatre Collection, at Harvard University's Houghton
Library. Since that time the Gilbert and Sullivan Collection has
been under the supervision of Mr. J. Rigbie Turner, Mary Flagler
Cary Curator of Music Manuscripts and Letters.]</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Admission for Research</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Applications for
admission to conduct research in the Library's Reading Room may
be directed to the curator or to the Supervisor of the Reading
Room.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Appointments</FONT></H3>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">It is essential
that prospective researchers should contact the curator at least
a week ahead of any visit to the Library, to arrange an appointment
and to discuss personally with the curator the nature of the research
and the materials required.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Gilbert and Sullivan
collection is largely uncatalogued, so it is likely that researchers
will find that uncatalogued materials exist in the collection
that would be useful in their research. This material is most
easily identified and located through consultation with the curator.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Reference Material</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">For research that
involves secondary (i.e., reference) material, researchers are
ordinarily directed to other libraries and collections; the Library's
collections are made available principally to qualified scholars
pursuing research that requires the examination primary material
(i.e., original printed or manuscript documents) in the collection.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Letters of Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Library's rules
require that readers unknown to the Library furnish a letter of
introduction from another scholar from a recognized academic institution,
attesting to the sponsor's knowledge of the character of the applicant
and the experience of the applicant in working with and handling
rare materials, in order to insure that the applicant is qualified
to make good use of the material, that Library policies will be
followed fully, and that rare material will be handled with extreme
care.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The requirement for
a letter of introduction may occasionally be waived in the case
of the Gilbert and Sullivan Collection, in recognition of the
fact that some researchers are connected with performing organizations
rather than academic institutions, and that in certain cases research
needs can be met without the need to handle rare material.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Regulations</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Procedures and Rules</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Researchers generally
work in the Library's Reading Room near the main entrance to the
Library on East Thirty-sixth Street. Because seating in the Reading
Room is limited, it is advisable to arrange an appointment in
advance in order to conduct research in the Library.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">[Library policies
now require that advance appointments be made in order to use
the Reading Room.]</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Hours</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Reading Room
is normally open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:45
p.m. The Reading Room is closed on weekends and holidays, and
for several weeks during the summer, usually at the end of August.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">[The Reading Room
is now open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,
but collection material is not delivered after 3:30 p.m.]</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Delivery</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Requested collection
items are usually delivered within half an hour of the time they
are requested. Collection material is not delivered between 1:00
and 2:00 p.m. or after 4:00 p.m. All collection material is collected
at 4:30 p.m.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">[All collection material
in the Reading Room is now collected before the 4:00 closing.]</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Equipment</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Typewriters and pens
or indelible pencils may not be used in the Reading Room. <I>Only
pencils may be used, whether or not the reader is handling rare
material.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Laptop-size computers
may be used in the Reading Room, <I>so long as they do not make
noise that other readers might find disturbing</I>. Electrical
receptacles (110 v., 60 Hz. only) are available.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Personal Property</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">All coats, books,
umbrellas, bags, cases, and other personal effects are to be checked
in the coat room. Handbags and cameras are to be left with the
Reading Room attendant. All readers' papers and personal effects
are subject to examination whenever the reader leaves the Reading
Room. Under no circumstances may visitors be brought into the
Reading Room.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Admission to Exhibitions</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Researchers are invited
to view the Library's exhibitions, for which they are <I>not</I>
expected to pay the Library's admission fees.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Handling of Collection
Material</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Only one book or
manuscript is issued at a time, unless special permission is given
by the curator to compare two or more items at a time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">In the interest of
preservation, whenever microfilms, facsimiles, or reproductions
are available, readers will ordinarily be requested to use these
instead of the original items. Occasionally, items from the collection
are on public display, or are unavailable owing to conservation
work or other research. Fragile or unstable material, such as
brittle printed libretti, may not be available for study. To avoid
possible disappointment, it is highly recommended that the list
of collection items desired should be reviewed in advance with
the curator.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The possession of
a reader's card does not in itself convey permission to use specific
items in any collection. Each request is subject to review by
and the approval of the curator of the respective collection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">[Reader's cards are
no longer used since registration is now maintained by computer
and appointments are required.]</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Photography</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Under no circumstances
may readers use photographic equipment or bring photographic equipment
into the Reading Room. All photography must be ordered through
the Library's photographic services.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Research In Absentia</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Library's curators
and Reading Room staff are <I><U>not</U></I> able to undertake
to pursue research for readers who are unable to attend to their
research in person. Under certain circumstances the Library may
be able to recommend professional researchers or graduate students
who may be willing to perform research for a fee; however, all
regulations and restrictions apply to surrogate researchers and
the Library is not a party to any such arrangements.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">Inquiries</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The Library is a
twenty-minute walk from Pennsylvania Station (Amtrak, New Jersey
Transit, and Long Island Railroad), a twenty-five-minute walk
from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and a ten-minute walk from
Grand Central Terminal. The nearest Port Authority Trans-Hudson
(PATH) train station is located at Sixth Avenue at 33rd Street,
a ten-minute walk from the Library.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Myriad Web, Arial, Helvetica">The least expensive
