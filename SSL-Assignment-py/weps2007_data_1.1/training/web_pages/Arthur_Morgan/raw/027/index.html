<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4>Arthurian Notes</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>By Julia Nolan</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER>For the fans of <I>Slayers</I> or for those Arthurian Legends fans
who wonder why I did what I did to their beloved characters.</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Niniane:</FONT>&nbsp; Niniane was the daughter of Dionas
and was promised, by the Roman Goddess Diana that the wisest man on earth
should covet her body and that she should be taught all that he knew as
a reward.&nbsp; Daddy didn’t seem to think so much about his daughter becoming
someone’s mistress, though, and either made her a Vestal (which would be
buried alive for sexual indiscretions) or, in some stories, just threatens
her with death. She does go off with Merlin (the wisest man) but goes to
great lengths to avoid sleeping with him, although she does make the promise
"teach me all you know and I will consent to anything you desire".&nbsp;
She eventually kills him, either by trapping him in a tower of air, entombing
him alive, trapping him in a tree, or sealing him in a cave after she has
learned everything he has to teach her and has assumed his powers.&nbsp;
She goes on to aide Arthur in everything, although she often appears just
a bit too late to do the most good.&nbsp; (Which could be attributed either
to absent mindedness, maliciousness, or perhaps both.)&nbsp; She tends
to do things indirectly, usually sending knights out to do things for her
and coming over only to do what only she can do.&nbsp; (Not a bad idea.&nbsp;
Why needlessly risk a life?)&nbsp; Niniane is an accomplished hunter, and
receives Excaliber from Arthur after he dies.&nbsp; She is the second Lady
of the Lake, in which guise she adopts and trains Lancelot.&nbsp; (Not
the one who gave Arthur the sword, however.)&nbsp; In later stories, she
marries Pelleas, a nice, although not particularly bright man who manages
to complete the Grail Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sources for character:&nbsp;
mainly medieval, particularly the Vulgate cycle with bits of modern for
the "ooops, did I do that?")&nbsp; In this story, I compare her to Eris
and Zelgadiss.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Merlin:&nbsp;</FONT> Merlin was born because a devil seduced
a woman to produce the Anti-Christ.&nbsp; Luckily the woman was very pious
and so her child turned out to be not quite the Anti-Christ…but he certainly
had remnants of his demonic heritage.&nbsp; Merlin claimed that his knowledge
of the past was from his father, his knowledge of the future from God.&nbsp;
Merlin was an incorrigible trickster, who had a truly twisted sense of
humor. He rarely appeared in his true form of (?) and "made" four kings,
of which Arthur was the last of. His motives are sketchy and he’s only
a "good guy" because he’s on the right side…some of the time.&nbsp; In
the medieval versions, Niniane is applauded for disposing of him.&nbsp;
All the same, he is a fascinating, if unruly character.&nbsp; He taught,
besides Niniane, Morgan le Fey.&nbsp; (Sources taken mainly from medieval
manuscripts, including the Suite du Merlin, the Vulgate, and Le’ Morte
d’Arthur)&nbsp; Compared to Rezo and Xellos.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Morgan le Fey:</FONT>&nbsp; When Morgan was only a small
child, her father was killed by king Uther so that he could marry the Duchess
Igraine, her mother.&nbsp; Uther and Igraine had a child named Arthur,
who Morgan le Fey probably had more reason than the older sister to feel
resentful towards him.&nbsp; When mommy married, Morgan’s older sister
Margawse was married off (at thirteen to a man old enough to be her father,
or even grandfather!) while Morgan was sent to a convent where, according
to Malory, she learned black magic.&nbsp; (Malory really liked the Church,
can’t you tell?)&nbsp; Eventually she married another king, Uriens and
bore him a son, although she was none to happy with him.&nbsp; She took
lovers and tried to kill her husband, although she was stopped by her son,
Yvaine.&nbsp; She repeatedly tried to seduce and destroy the various knights,
particularly Lancelot.&nbsp; Some of her most famous stories involve her
trying to steal Excaliber or to point out Guenivere and Lancelot’s little
indiscretions.&nbsp; Niniane tends to thwart all of her plans, although
Morgan’s malicious gossip eventually gets through.&nbsp; (Niniane apparently
thwarts everyone’s plans.)&nbsp; Morgan eventually does team up with her
archrival when Arthur dies as both bear him to Avalon.&nbsp; T. H. White
has her as a fairy who lives in a castle of food, constantly eating.&nbsp;
(Information taken mainly from Medieval sources, particularly the Vulgate
and Le Morte d’Arthur.)&nbsp; Morgan is compared to Lina with her fierce
temper and boisterous eating habits.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Margawse:&nbsp;</FONT> Margawse was the daughter of Igraine
and the Duke, the sister of Morgan, and the mother of Gawaine, Gaheris,
Gareth, and Agravaine by her husband Lot (a huge enemy of Arthur) and of
Mordred by her own half-brother Arthur.&nbsp; Although in most stories
Arthur is unwitting about this incest, Margawse’s guilt changes with the
author. In some stories she is actually defecting from her husband’s side
and falls madly in love with this handsome young man.&nbsp; In other stories,
she is a spy, but still does not realize that Arthur is her own brother.
In others, of course, she possesses full knowledge of what she does. When
Arthur discovered what he had done, Merlin advised him to have all children
born on May first destroyed (as that was the day that Mordred would be
born) and so they were all set on a boat which was set out to sea. However,
when the boat crashed on the rocks, only Mordred survived and was raised
and later returned to his true birthright.&nbsp; Margawse was well known
for her strong sexual appetite, and was killed while in bed with her lover
by her son.&nbsp; (Incidentally, her lover was younger than most of her
sons…)&nbsp; (Taken mainly from Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur)&nbsp; Margawse
is compared to Nagha.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Igraine:&nbsp;</FONT> Although Igraine is an adulteress
in Arthurian legend, she is an unwitting one.&nbsp; When Uther seduces
her to produce Arthur, it is in the guise of her husband. In fact, when
she finds that Uther is flirting with her, she actually tells her husband
to leave because she doesn’t like the idea of that sort of thing.&nbsp;
After Uther dies, she usually goes to a convent.&nbsp; Malory is filled
with what a good and well behaved woman she was. How boring!&nbsp; (Sources
used:&nbsp; Le Morte d’Arthur.)&nbsp; Compared to Sylphiel.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gawaine:&nbsp;</FONT> Gawaine is the eldest son of Margawse
and Lot.&nbsp; Although he is originally the head knight, he is deposed
by Lancelot and becomes stupider and more wanton.&nbsp; Poor guy.&nbsp;
Gawaine is basically your nice guy.&nbsp; He’s brave, cares for those he
loves, and is willing to do what needs to be done, no matter the consequences
(as the stories of Dame Ragnelle and the Green Knight might point out.)&nbsp;
He is constantly having to deal with his aggravating younger brothers,
and is the one, in Le Morte d’Arthur who insists upon the war with Lancelot
as Lancelot has killed several of his younger brothers.&nbsp; Family ties
are important to Gawaine.&nbsp; He also avenges his father’s death and
other such things.&nbsp; (Taken mainly from Le Morte d’Arthur, but also
from Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight and various other folk tales.)&nbsp;
Compared with Gourry.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mordred:</FONT>&nbsp; Mordred is the youngest and doomed
child of Margawse and Arthur.&nbsp; From how he’s treated in life, it might
not really be all that surprising that Mordred turned out to be the villain
in Arthurian legend.&nbsp; His father wants him dead and his mother is
probably more concerned with men his own age…Mordred helps to spread the
rumors about Guenivere and Lancelot’s affair and stirs up trouble at almost
every chance he can get. And yet, for however evil a villain he is, he’s
one of the few likable characters in Malory. Mordred is very intelligent
and tricky.&nbsp;&nbsp; He eventually does manage to take over Camelot,
and a massive war ensures.&nbsp; He orders his step mother Guenivere to
marry him and locks her into the Tower of London when she refuses.&nbsp;
(Taken from Le Morte d’Arthur and The Once and Future King, not that they’re
particularly different.)&nbsp; Compared to Xellos.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Guenivere:</FONT>&nbsp; Forget about the modern sources.&nbsp;
In medieval Arthuriana, Guenivere is a very spoiled princess who is a pain
if she doesn’t get her way. She chases Lancelot off to court repeatedly
with claims of "you don’t love me enough" and drives poor Arthur who really
does love her stark raving mad.&nbsp; She never has children, and is tormented
in some stories by her clone half sister, also named Guenivere.&nbsp; She’s
very athletic and may have come from stories of a shield maiden in her
early history.&nbsp; (Taken mainly from Le Morte d’Arthur.)&nbsp; Compared
to Amelia.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arthur:</FONT>&nbsp; Arthur, of course, is the great king
of Arthurian legend, who the whole legend system is named after.&nbsp;
He is brave, noble, good, self sacrificing, all of that.&nbsp; Perhaps
his one lack of sacrifice comes to his wife, Guenivere, who he refuses
to leave even though he needs legitimate children to inherit his throne.&nbsp;
He’s a fairly dreary character, really.&nbsp; (General)&nbsp; Compared
to Zelgadiss, for lack of anything better.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Grail Legend</FONT></CENTER>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible states that after Jesus the Nazarene
had died, a wealthy man named Joseph of Aramethea asked Pilot for his body
for burial.&nbsp; He then placed the body into a tomb with all the proper
ceremonies and had it sealed.&nbsp; Legend also states that Joseph possessed
the cup that Christ’s blood was caught in and perhaps even the spear that
gave him his death wound.&nbsp; Joseph then traveled to Britain and, upon
the isle of Avalon, planted his spear into the ground where a whitethorn
bush bloomed.&nbsp; The cup, called the Grail, then was hidden somewhere.
However, the holy powers of the Grail could heal, give eternal life, spiritual
goodness, and all of that. The idea of it probably came from a pagan Celtic
cauldron which people were scarified into, but which was supposed to bestow
important things like everlasting life and renewal.&nbsp; The cauldron
is the greatest of the 13 treasures of Britian.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Arthurian legend, an apparition appears
of a young woman bearing the Grail.&nbsp; Someone (usually Merlin) then
encourages the knights to travel for a year to retrieve the Grail.&nbsp;
Only three (in Malory four) knights manage to be pure enough to find the
Grail:&nbsp; Galahad, Percival, and Bors.&nbsp; (I think Bors…don’t quote
me.&nbsp; In Malory Pelleas also finds the Grail.)&nbsp; However, even
this is not enough to save the land from the blight which is about to come.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Demons, Gods, and Others in Arthurian Legend</FONT></CENTER>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, between the Anti-Christ and
the chosen follower of Diana, not to mention a score of well behaved Christians,
religion in Arthurian legend is confusing.&nbsp; This is made more difficult
in that both Morgan le Fey and Niniane are called fairies (someone who
uses magic) and that, although there are two different sides, the sides
seem based more on loyalty than blood and that characters are continually
defecting.&nbsp; For example, although Igraine is good, both of her daughters
are "bad" and her son is "good".&nbsp; Of course, although Margawse and
Morgan are bad, Margawse is not unredeemably bad and tends to do some useful
things for Arthur, as does Morgan, who eventually bears him away to Avalon
despite her attempts on his life.&nbsp; Or what do we say about Merlin
and Niniane? Niniane is obviously unloyal and a ruthless killer, but she
saves Arthur’s life on occasion. Both her and Merlin do save Arthur and
his knights, but often appear too late to be of maximum help.&nbsp; Gawaine,
Arthur’s head knight for a while, is the son of Margawse, and apparently
puts patriotic loyalty above familial loyalty as he leaves his mother in
order to be Arthur’s knight.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are continual feuds as well.&nbsp; King
Claudus, Merlin’s friend, decides to kill King Ban, the father of Lancelot.&nbsp;
Niniane saves Lancelot and proceeds to attack King Claudus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Morgan conspires with Merlin against Niniane’s friends, Niniane conspires
with Merlin against Morgan, and Morgan and Niniane conspire against Merlin,
all often in the same story!&nbsp; Morgan of course plots against Arthur,
often with sister Margawse’s help, and tends to use Guenivere and Lancelot
as her tools.&nbsp; The whole plot is so filled with characters who are
perfectly willing to use other characters to their advantage that it’s
hard to figure out what side anyone is on!
