Spring Term has gone by extremely fast and the year is now just about over!&nbsp;
I can't even explain&nbsp; how I finished everything I did this term. My
research paper, unfortunately, utilized most of my time throughout the
term. While it required much more time than I anticipated, in the end I
pleased with the final draft. When the assignment was first assigned to
the class, I was convinced that I would write about Smallpox and how it
is still a threat to humans around the world.&nbsp; As our class moved
on into a new subject about climate change, I became fascinated with how
much the weather affects our everyday lives.&nbsp; I then decided to focus
my paper on El Nino and how the changes in the weather can significantly
destroy a community economically.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent many long hours at
the library looking up research and trying to come up with a thesis statement.&nbsp;
I went through several drafts and I wasn't satisfied with the statement
until I was halfway through my paper.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Papyrus"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Neighborhood Survey project was by far the highlight of the year.&nbsp;
I worked with Ashley Gregg and Stephan Johnson and we analyzed the Northwest
district in Portland.&nbsp; We picked out two different sections in the
“neighborhood” and walked around observing people and looked for interesting
differences between people in the area.&nbsp; We first took a strip of
Northwest 23rd Ave and&nbsp; walked down it several blocks taking pictures.&nbsp;
Later we drove over to another area and observed Wallace Park.&nbsp; Here
we became surrounded by hundreds of small children playing in the park.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Papyrus"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Overall there were not many assignments this term, but the few that we
had were time consuming.&nbsp; I really feel like the the research paper
forced me to use really critically think.&nbsp; Trying to incorporate the
four University Studies goals this term was challenging.&nbsp; Critical
Thinking and Communication were used most frequently this term, however
we did touch on the other two goals of Human Experience and Ethical Issues
and Diversity.&nbsp; It really depended on what each person chose to discuss
in their research paper on how much they used the University Goals.</font></font></font>

</i>This is a copy of my first draft to my research paper.&nbsp; As you
can tell by the title my paper&nbsp; it focuses on El Nino and how there
is an economical impact around the globe due to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Researching
this topic was enjoyable for me,&nbsp; it always is easier to research
a topic that you are interested in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went through many different
"drafts" of thesis statements,&nbsp; it took me a while to narrow my idea
to one area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally I decided on one thesis.</font></font></font>

I have decided to add a page that shows the different steps I took when
deciding on a thesis statement.&nbsp; I found this part of the research
paper to be the most difficult.&nbsp; Deciding on a specific topic can
be complicated because there are many different topics from which to choose.This
happened with me when I finally decided on what broad topic I wanted to
focus on.&nbsp; I knew that I wanted to research El Nino, but I had a hard
time coming to a specific topic within El Nino to research.&nbsp; I originally
wanted to write about El Nino and how the weather change affects animal
life.&nbsp; But after attempting to research the topic, I gave up on the
idea because I just couldn’t find enough information.&nbsp; Finally I decided
on El Nino and how it effects society economically.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+1>&nbsp; Now that you’ve
hopefully read the first draft of my paper, you can see the improvement
I have made.&nbsp; I decided to add in subheadings with the intent of making
the paper easier for the reader to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also added
on to my conclusion, I thought that I needed to address the main points
more directly in the end.&nbsp; I trust that you will be able to see the
improvement I have made.</font></font>

<p><b><i><font face="Papyrus"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Neighborhood
Project</font></font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Papyrus"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1><i>&nbsp;
</i>The
neighborhood survey project was a definite highlight of the term.&nbsp;
I had a great time working with my group, which consisted of Ashley and
Stephan.&nbsp; We decided that we wanted to examine the Northwest district
of Portland.&nbsp; We went and observed two different areas in the neighborhood;
first we went by Couch Park where we noticed several people sleeping in
the park. Then after we observed the park we walked around 21st street
and took pictures of people and interesting things we detected.&nbsp; After
21st street we walked up to 23rd Ave where the atmosphere is much different.&nbsp;
There is a wide mixture of people that interact there.&nbsp; There are
the upper class people and at the same locations there are the street beggars.&nbsp;
A little past 23rd Ave is Wallace Park.&nbsp; Here was the other area of
the neighborhood that we chose to observe.&nbsp; Unlike any other part
of our neighborhood, Wallace Park was filled with kids.&nbsp; Hundreds
of kids were at the park causing all types of havoc.&nbsp; We watched as
several kids played with toy guns shooting each other, while another group
of kids fenced with sticks they had found on the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Papyrus"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This project could not have come at a better time during the term.&nbsp;
With the research paper at the same time eating up a majority of our time
the neighborhood project seemed to lightenthings up and get our minds of
the paper for about a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to technology problems I have
no link for the Neighborhood project, Sorry!.</font></font></font>
