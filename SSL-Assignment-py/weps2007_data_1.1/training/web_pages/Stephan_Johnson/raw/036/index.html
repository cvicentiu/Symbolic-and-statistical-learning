<p><font size="7" color="#FFFF00">NORTHWEST HOOPS OREGON &amp; WASHINGTON PLAYERS OF THE WEEK&nbsp;
- WEEK 2</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="6">Jefferson's Mac Hopson, Issaquah's Garrison
Carr, Kent-Meridian's Stephan Johnson, Shorewood's Rob Diedrichs and Curtis'
Isaiah Thomas</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Mac Hopson, senior 6'-0&quot; point guard from Portland's
Jefferson High is Northwest Hoops Oregon Player of the Week. Hopson, and the
Democrats made a huge statement by traveling to the Les Schwab Hoop Challenge at
Brougham Pavilion on the campus of Seattle Pacific University Saturday night.
Hopkins, scored 17 points in a 69-56 win over the defending 3A Champions from
Washington. Washington's 3A basketball is among the best at that level anywhere
in the United States, with highly respected programs like Rainier Beach and
Mercer Island, arguably could be where the best basketball is played in the
state.&nbsp; O'Dea is considered a favorite to make it back to back titles this
season.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As for Hopkins and his teammates, they will be taking a lot of
confidence with them into the Les Schwab Invitational which begins December
27-30 at Liberty High School in Hillsboro. Hopkins, who has the tendency to hit
timely three pointers and is a very good ball handler that excels when things
seem to break down, came up big against the Fighting Irish. Look out Oregon, the
Democrats could be for real.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In a week that featured several great individual performances
which included wins over higher ranked opponents, its just too tough to give it
to a single player.&nbsp; Garrison Carr of Issaquah, Stephan Johnson of
Kent-Meridian, Rob Dieterichs of Shorewood and Isaiah Thomas of Curtis are
Northwest Hoops Washington Players of the Week. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Carr, 5'-11&quot; senior point guard, who is headed to
American University, who was a critical member of Issaquah's run to a state
title which fell two years ago in the championship game against Rainier Beach,
scored 37 against Mt Si and 33 points in a huge 59-58 win against Interlake.
Issaquah (5-0, 2-0) rely on Carr to carry the load, averaged nearly 25 points
per game last season, will again be among the scoring leader in the state this
season. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Stephan Johnson, 6'-0&quot; senior point guard, whose team had
high hopes last season, defeated defending state champion and highly ranked
Kentwood, 64-58. Johnson, who is going to be at the University of Pacific next
season had 24 points and is looking to put Kent-Meridian (4-0, 2-0) back into
the title picture. Johnson also had 21 points in a 68-31 win over Sumner and 22
points in a 67-55 win over Roosevelt. The athletic point guard has a really nice
all-around game, which includes plays on the defensive end. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Dieterichs, 6'-7&quot; senior wing, helped Shorewood (3-0,
2-0) defeat highly touted Mountlake Terrace 51-48, by contributing 28 points, in
dominating performance,&nbsp; which included 2 critical threes down the stretch.
Dieterichs was the difference. Dieterichs also had 19 in a 52-49 win against
Mariner, who had beaten Mercer Island last week. Dieterichs can beat you inside
as well as from the perimeter. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Thomas,&nbsp; 5'-8&quot; sophomore point guard, is one of the
rising stars in the state of Washington. Barnes lead his Curtis&nbsp; (4-0,
3'-0) teammates to wins over Decatur 74-49 with 20 points, highly touted Bethel 72-70
with 25 point and
Bellarmine Prep 71-56 and had 19 point.&nbsp; Pretty good week for a soph!
Thomas is averaging
23.0 pts/gm. through the first 4 games. </font></p>
