<br clear="all">Chapter 2: Ravenclaw Quidditch Captains<br />
<br />
	Serena silently made her way down the corridor on the way to her next class, Transfiguration. She smiled slightly, transfiguration was always held with the Ravenclaws… <br />
<br />
	Lily said that she had to run ahead to speak with Professor McGonagall about something that had to do with her prefect duties. She couldn’t remember… she actually hadn’t even been listening. Remus was most likely with the Marauders who would probably end up late to class, for one reason or another. So basically she was walking to class alone today.<br />
<br />
	She reached the classroom a few minutes before the bell rang and walked over to the seat by Lily. <br />
<br />
	“Hello,” she said cheerfully. “McGonagall said that she wasn’t going to give them detention, isn’t that great?”<br />
<br />
	Serena smiled and nodded, even though she didn’t have the slightest clue who she was talking about… Anyway, the Marauders, amazing, made it to class a few seconds before the bell rang. <br />
<br />
	Lily of course rolled her eyes as they passed, when Potter winked at her. They traveled to the back and sat down.<br />
<br />
	“Good morning class,” McGonagall said from the front of the room. “I have decided to make seating arrangements, since some of you aren’t mature enough to handle seating next to each other.” There were a few groans at this, and after saying it she glanced to the back of her classroom with a scowl, only to be met by the innocent looks of James Potter and Sirius Black.<br />
<br />
	“And to make sure you cannot communicate I will be sitting you next to a member of the other house,” there were even more groans at this as Serena’s eyes grew wide at this. “Please move towards the seat I assign you to quietly and without any complaint.”<br />
<br />
	She walked over to the front-left corner of the classroom and stopped at the first seat. She looked down at her list, “Erin Smith,” she pointed to the adjacent seat, “Julie Richards”.<br />
<br />
	This continued on as McGonagall continued to match people. Lily got stuck with a very uh… tall boy in the second row. Serena still laughed as she remembered the look on her face when she saw who she had to sit by. After all Thomas Dean was well over six and a half feet tall, the tallest guy in the school, and wasn’t exactly the most… attractive person used ever meet. <br />
	His hair was dark brown, wavy, and very greasy. His face was covered in large pimples, and he had brown eyes that you could barely see past his large, thick glasses. He was muggleborn, obviously, because his teeth had braces. Serena shuddered when she remembered his smile when he heard he was to sit by Lily. Food and plaque was stuck in his teeth and smile, and she remembered seeing something green…<br />
<br />
	She was thinking of Thomas Dean and his nasty hygiene problems when she heard Professor McGonagall call her name.<br />
<br />
	“...you are to sit with Stephan Johnson.”<br />
<br />
	Her eyes widened and her mouth opened slightly in shock. Across the room Lily sat trying not to giggle but unable to hold back the smile that crept onto her face. <br />
<br />
	Of course Serena was too preoccupied with the situation at hand to notice. She quickly shook her head and practically jumped up, as she made her way over to the indicated seat. Stephan smiled at her from her right, and she shyly returned it. She then quickly turned away, trying to hide the blush that was creeping onto her cheeks.<br />
<br />
	As she sat she couldn’t help but smile. Even though she probably made a complete foul of herself sitting there like an idiot, she got to sit by Stephan Johnson. THE Stephan Johnson. Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, absolutely gorgeous Stephan Johnson. The boy of ever girls’ dreams. She sighed, with a dreamy expression on her face, oh how she loved Professor McGonagall.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A/N: Yay! I finally got the second chapter up! Did you think I died? Probably not, but you never know… encase it wasn’t COMPLETELY obvious, Serena has a crush on Stephan, but what about Remus?!<br />
<br />
Serena: You like? I got your plot going, sorry it took so long!  <br />
