<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The Honorable Carol Higbee, 
Superior Court Judge of Atlantic County, New Jersey, has ruled that New Jersey 
Sports Productions, Inc (d.b.a. Main Events) and Main Events Vice-President of 
Boxing Operations Carl Moretti did not act negligently with respect to Stephan 
Johnson and his death, it was announced today by Main Events CEO Kathy Duva.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Johnson’s 
family had filed a “wrongful death” suit against a number of parties, including 
Main Events.&nbsp; Among the parties who were not granted summary judgment and who 
must stand trial are the South Carolina Athletic Commission and various doctors 
who examined Johnson prior to the bout.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Johnson, a Brooklyn native, died from injuries suffered 
in a November 20, 1999 bout against former world champion Paul Vaden.&nbsp; 
Although he was already on medical suspension in Canada, Johnson was licensed in 
South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. </b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Johnson&#39;s mother Ira had this to say after her 
son&#39;s death: 
&#39;&#39;Stephan had a passion for boxing. He really loved boxing from the time he was 
a little kid, 5 years old -- loved it with all his heart. Whenever I talked to 
him about stopping, he said, &#39;Stop asking me to quit. I&#39;ve never been in jail. 
I&#39;ve never done drugs. Let me pursue my passion.&#39;&#39;&#39;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Johnson&#39;s professional career spanned over twelve 
years, his record stands at 27-9-1, 18 KOs. In his 12th professional fight 
Johnson battled a&nbsp; young Roy Jones, Jr. who was then making his second 
appearance in the pro ranks. After winning the IBU Light Middleweight title via 
TKO5 over Sam Garr in September of 1998, Johnson faced Fitz Vanderpool for the 
WBF Light Middleweight title in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on April 14, 1999. 
Johnson was knocked unconscious by Vanderpool, taken from the ring on a stretcher and 
subsequently placed on a medical suspension in Canada.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Stephan fought twice after the incident in Canada. Only 
four months later, in South Carolina, where he earned a ten-rounder decision win 
against Otilio Villareal. Two months after the&nbsp; Villareal victory Johnson met Calvin Moody in Albany, 
Georgia, winning by way of TKO3.  </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Six weeks later, and in what would be his last fight ever, 
Johnson faced Paul Vaden for the vacant USBA Light Middleweight title, for a 
reported $100,000 purse. Reported brain injuries caused his death on December 5, 
1999, two weeks after the Vaden match, at the age of 31. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Coming into 
this bout, Vaden&#39;s only losses had been to Keith Holmes and Terry Norris. 
Subsequently to Johnson&#39;s death Vaden faced and lost to Shibata Flores in 
Las Vegas, Nevada. Paul Vaden 
announced his retirement after the Flores bout, and as of this date has remained 
retired.</font></b><br>
