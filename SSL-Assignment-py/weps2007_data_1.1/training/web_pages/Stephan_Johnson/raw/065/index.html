   <p class="head"><b>International 
				Food & Beverage Forum Celebrates 10th Anniversary with Events at J&W</b></p>
			<p>PROVIDENCE, 
				R.I. &#151; April 21 2003 &#151; Celebrating its 10th anniversary, the International 
				Food & Beverage Forum (IF&BF) held its annual meeting at Johnson & Wales University 
				April 2 through April 5. IF&BF members from around the world came together 
				to induct new members to their Hall of Fame, to award student scholarships, 
				to participate in educational panels and to attend the foundation ceremony 
				of the IF&BF Hall of Fame Society.</p>
			<p>Comprising 50 
				top industry leaders, the IF&BF aims to enhance global dialogue, knowledge 
				and viable creativity, as well as aid in the growth and education of future 
				culinary and hospitality professionals. Each year, the group honors leaders 
				in the foodservice and hospitality industries. The IF&BF Hall of Fame, housed 
				in the Culinary Archives & Museum at Johnson & Wales University, inducted 
				its newest members at a gala dinner on April 3:<br>
				&#149; 
				Michael and Ariane Batterberry, leading authorities on food and entertaining 
				who founded two national food magazines - Food Arts, and Food & Wine.<br>
				&#149; Jean-Marie Lacroix, executive chef of Lacroix at The Rittenhouse in 
				Philadelphia.</p>
			<p>During the Hall 
				of Fame Gala Dinner the IF&BF also honored:<br>
				&#149; The 2003 Restaurateur of the Year: Hans-Henrik V&auml;lim&auml;ki, chef 
				de cuisine at the Michelin two-star Chez Dominique in Helsinki, Finland.<br>
				&#149; The 2003 J&W Alumni Restaurateur of the Year: Alfonso Contrisciani 
				'79, CMC, whose newest project is Alfonso's in Atlantic City.</p>
			<p>At Friday's 
				evening reception, 40 charter members of the Hall of Fame Society were officially 
				inducted; the group aims to raise both awareness and funds for the Culinary 
				Archives and Museum. To that end, the first annual Hall of Fame Society auction 
				raised more than $40,000 to go towards acquisitions and maintenance.</p>
			<p>In addition 
				to donating money to the Culinary Archives and Museum, the IF&BF has contributed 
				a total of $200,000 to 39 scholarship recipients at the University. "Many 
				of us are at the top of our careers," noted Dr. Kurt Fischer, IF&BF president, 
				"and we want to give something back. Johnson & Wales produces a caliber of 
				students you can use directly in your business, and we chose to hold our events 
				at the Providence Campus to encourage those students, both by sharing our 
				knowledge of the industry with them and aiding them financially."</p>
			<p>Scholarship 
				winners for this year are: Jennifer Avent, Severna Park, Md.; Cheryl Beckwith, 
				West Barnstable, Mass.; Shyion Collins, East Hartford, Conn.; Juliette Demma, 
				North Bergen, N.J.; Michael Garcia, Geneseo, N.Y.; Stephan Johnson, Honolulu, 
				Hawaii; Inge Karto, Indonesia; Anthony Leonardo, Somerset, Mass.; Jason Perez, 
				Valrico, Fla.; Michael Tobins, Concord, Mass.</p>
			<p>As part of their 
				support for education, two separate panel discussions tackled the topics: 
				"Why I need to study Mozart and Beethoven to become a rock star chef" and 
				"How to select a mentor and what role the mentor should play."</p>
