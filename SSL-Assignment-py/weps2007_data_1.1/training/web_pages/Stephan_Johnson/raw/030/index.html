          			“Eight.... nine.... ten.” Probably the last words in the world a boxer wants to hear. Or are they? If you hear the referee count to 10 at least you’re still conscious of your surroundings. Unfortunately, some fighters aren’t quite as lucky after being knocked out. Depending on your point of view, a KO can be seen as a thing of beauty or brutality. They often strike from nowhere, attacking fighters when they least expect it. Others can be seen coming miles away, slowly gathering strength round after round. 

<P>


<P>
Knockouts are a nightly occurrence in the boxing ring and even the most casual fan has witnessed spectacular sudden endings such as Hasim Rahman uncrowning Lennox Lewis for the heavyweight title in 2001 or the slower methodical version like Muhammad Ali punishing Floyd Patterson over 12 rounds in 1965 for calling him Cassius Clay. When you read the results in the paper though, all you see are the numbers, KO5, TKO12, and the photos. Pictures may be worth a thousand words but they don’t tell the whole story. Each knockout is unique. It has a life of its own.

<P>


<P>
When Chris “Mr. Showtime” Johnson  was knocked out by Antonio Tarver, it not only ended their 2001 light heavyweight fight but also Johnson’s career at the age of 29. Hurt and tired, Johnson was on the ropes when Tarver’s final shot to the head dropped him to the canvas in the tenth round. Johnson made it to his feet after the 10 count but staggered to his corner where he collapsed as the ringside doctor examined him. He was conscious at that point but was immediately taken to hospital for a CAT scan that revealed a possible small bleeding in his brain. While still conscious and walking, Johnson was quickly transferred to a hospital with a larger neurology staff. The next morning Johnson was still under close observation but was alert and aware of his surroundings.

<P>


<P>
Even to the most hardened boxing observer it was frightening to see Johnson lay motionless on the canvas for what seemed like hours before being rushed to the hospital. The Jamaican born boxer was a legitimate contender and an Olympic bronze medalist for Canada in the 1992 Games. It was his first knockout loss in over 20 years. Johnson spoke about the devastating KO months later as he was still trying to come to terms with it. 

<P>


<P>
“August 3, 2001 is a night I will never forget, yet in the same breath it is a night that I don\'t remember too much. It was the night my whole world changed, leaving my future filled with uncertainty. I try my best to keep my knowledge of the incident to a minimum. I remember the sound of the bell to begin the fight, and I remember connecting with my first body shot. After that, it was all down hill. I awoke in the dressing room with no knowledge of what had just taken place. I slipped in and out of consciousness, and my heart weakened as my life was against the ropes. I prayed to my God to see me through to the next chapter of my life, and if he did, I would no longer fight and I would let go all my bitterness. The bitterness has been easy to let go, but I still struggle with the fighting, it\'s all I\'ve ever known. As I drove home from the airport, my mind flashed back to all the sacrifices I made, all the roads my little body beat up to attain that now unattainable dream. Tears welled up in the corners of my eyes. With my heart weak and my soul left drifting, what now was the question?” 

<P>


<P>
Johnson, who began boxing at nine years of age, knew immediately he should retire but was reluctant to leave the sport he loves. After receiving a call from female boxer Natalie Brown he channeled his energy instead into training her and several other boxers in Atlanta.

<P>


<P>
Just as Johnson was a victim of a sudden knockout, former #1 ranked WBC super welterweight Fitz “The Whip” Vanderpool has suffered a couple of TKO losses in his last two bouts. The Trinidadian, who fights out of Canada, was stopped in the sixth round by Fernando Vargas last July and in the first round by Marco Antonio Rubio last May. Vanderpool has also been on the other side of the knockout fence and one of his more dramatic victories came in April, 1999 when he TKO’d Stephan Johnson in the 11th of their 12 rounder. Vanderpool said most boxers don’t go into their bouts preoccupied by scoring a knockout but will go for it if they sense their opponent is hurt. “When I see them backing up that’s when I realize they’re in trouble. Their defenses are down, that’s when you step it up.”

<P>


<P>
 Against Johnson, many observers felt Vanderpool was behind on points and with only two rounds to go needed a knockout to win the WBF light middleweight title. That’s when he jumped on him. “You just see the opening and you get an adrenaline rush. You feel fresh and rejuvenated. You get a new burst of energy and nothing is going to stop you, it’s just go, go, go. And if you get to that point and it doesn’t come you’ve got to find another second wind. You’ve got to dig deep like a champ and find it within yourself. You think how bad you want it and about how hard you’ve trained in the gym getting ready for this fight and nothing is going to take that from you. You go for broke.”

<P>


<P>
The adrenaline took over Vanderpool, and while not known as a devastating puncher he had Johnson battered and bleeding, reeling on the ropes when the referee jumped in to stop the onslaught. Johnson made it to his corner but was drifting in and out of consciousness and was taken on a stretcher to the hospital. There was a lot of concern in the ring as it took over 25 minutes before the ambulance arrived.

<P>


<P>
“I stayed in the ring because the way Stephan was down and out you just don’t know. I mean the first thing that goes through your head when you see him down and they’re calling in the doctors and he’s lifeless, you think this could be me. You just go wow and thank God you weren’t on the receiving end. You’re going into the fights and not looking to hurt these guys. You’re going in to do a job and win but not to seriously hurt somebody. It’s unfortunate when these things happen.”

<P>
 

<P>
Unfortunate it was. Eight months and three fights later Stephan Johnson of Brooklyn, NY, was dead at the age of 31. Immediately after the Vanderpool bout Johnson had been suspended by the Ontario Boxing Commission in Canada but fought in the US, winning on points in August and by TKO in October. On Nov. 20th, 1999 Johnson met Paul Vaden for the Vacant USBA Light Middleweight Title in Atlantic City. Again, as in the Vanderpool match, Johnson was ahead on points (two of the judges) as the fight entered the 10th round. A seemingly harmless flurry of punches by Vaden sent Johnson to the ring apron and his head hit the lower rope on the way down. He was immediately taken to hospital on a stretcher where he was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma, an accumulation of blood between the brain and the skull. He lay in a coma for the last two weeks of his life unaware his family and friends kept a steady vigil at his bedside. Most people think he never fully recovered after being knocked out by Vanderpool.

<P>


<P>
Although Vanderpool himself has been on the receiving end of knockouts they were instances where the referee stopped the contests making it difficult for him to fully realize what both Johnson’s had experienced. He said if he does get hurt during a fight he tries not to retreat and create any distance between him and his opponent. In the loss to Vargas he said he was stunned but not hurt at the time the fight was stopped. “I was still able to fire back. I wasn’t defenseless with my hands down.”

<P>


<P>
“In the Rubio fight he caught me cold, the legs were gone and it was difficult. I went into the survival mode. I looked to my corner and they said move, getaway, survive till the next round. At that point all you’re thinking about is this guy in front of you who wants to take you out of there, nothing else.”  Two knockdowns later though and the fight was over before the bell could ring to end the first round. “I had to back up and try and stick and move but he was all over me like a wild animal. He saw an opening and pounced on it. It might have been a blessing though. It probably wasn’t meant to be.” Vanderpool said when the fight was stopped his mind was still clear but he had to shake the cobwebs from his head. “When you get knocked down like that the biggest thing a fighter’s got to remember is to get back up.”

<P>


<P>
Vanderpool said erasing a knockout from your memory seems to be the best thing a boxer can do before entering the ring again. “You have to forget about it. I mean all that stuff’s in the past. You’re looking ahead. The future’s ahead of you, your opponent\'s ahead of you and that’s where you have to go. If you keep looking in the past you’re looking back at the wrong things. It’s like driving a car you can’t be looking back you’ve got to look forward to where you’re going, straight ahead. A lot of people say so and so should retire, but I mean just because you get knocked out once. The same thing happened to Roy Jones Jr. He was the champion and he got knocked out. It’s happened to a lot of the greats, Foreman, Frazier, Duran, Hearns, Leonard, and Roy’s going to go back in there and fight for a title and that’s what I’m going to do, fight for the Canadian title and keep going on.”

<P>


<P>
While knockouts have a different effect on everybody who has been victimized by one, Vanderpool said the key to recovering depends on the shape you are in. Not being in top condition for a fight is a cardinal sin that too many boxers make. While there are commissions and doctors overseeing the health and safety of boxers today, Vanderpool brings up an interesting and valid point concerning the accumulation of punches boxers take throughout the years. “The whole thing is that you’ve got to see what these guys are doing in the gym in preparation for their fights. A lot of guys are sparring with partners who are 15 to 20 pounds heavier and they’re taking all kinds of shots from them, figuring if they can take it from a heavier guy then taking it in the ring during a fight will be no problem. Doctors and commissioners can only judge a fighter by what they see in the ring. They don’t know what he’s been hit with the six weeks prior to the fight. It all accumulates. With Stephan Johnson, people say Fitz isn’t a hard puncher, he’s not cracking this guy, but over 11 rounds it was tap, tap, tap, and when I unleashed the shots in the 11th that was it right there. It just broke the yolk.”

<P>


<P>
With boxers stepping into the ring only once or twice a year Vanderpool’s point should be taken seriously. Boxers spend the majority of their time training and sparring, taking an endless stream of punches that eventually wear down the head and body. It may seem like a time consuming and expensive solution, but maybe commissioners are barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps each sparring session should also be regulated and recorded to see if a boxer is taking too much punishment before entering the ring. Maybe Stephan and Chris Johnson would still be living out their dreams of being a world champion.
