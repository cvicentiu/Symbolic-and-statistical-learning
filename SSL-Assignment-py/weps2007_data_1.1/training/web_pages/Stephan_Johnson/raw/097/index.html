  <p>Roy Levesta Jones Jr. is a former Middleweight, Super Middleweight,  Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight boxing champion from Pensacola,  Florida. Jones was Ring Magazine's &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; in 1994 and  was voted the &quot;Fighter of the Decade&quot; in 1999 by the Boxing Writers  Association of America. Between 1994 and 2003, Jones was considered one  of the best pound for pound fighters in the world. Jones's advisor and  sometime manager is Pensacola lawyer Fred Levin. His longtime trainer  is Alton Merkerson.<br />
</p>
  <p>Besides a stellar amateur career and a decade of  diligent training, by the time he turned professional, Jones had  already sparred with many professional boxers in the gyms including  NABF champion Ronnie Essett, IBF world champion Lindell Holmes and  all-time great Sugar Ray Leonard. His pedigree was much stronger than  that of the average kid about to embark on a professional career. Jones  began as a professional on May 6, 1989, knocking out Ricky Randall in  two rounds in Pensacola. For his next fight, he faced the more  experienced Stephan Johnson in Atlantic City, and beat him by a  knockout in round eight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Jones built an  impressive record of 15-0 with 15 knockouts before stepping up in  class, when he met former world Welterweight champion Jorge Vaca in a  Pay Per View fight on January 10, 1992. He knocked Vaca out in round  one, to reach 16 knockout wins in a row. After one more knockout win,  Jones went the distance for the first time, against former world  champion Jorge Castro, who lost a 10-round decision to Jones in front  of a USA Network national audience.<br />
    hree more knockouts in a row  followed, after which Jones was given his first opportunity to fight  for a world title: on May 22 of 1993, he beat future world champion  Bernard Hopkins by a clear unanimous decision in Washington D.C., to  capture the IBF's vacant World Middleweight Title. All three judges  scored the fight 116-112. For his next fight, he chose to fight another  future world champion, Thulane &quot;Sugar Boy&quot; Malinga, in a non-title  affair. Jones beat Malinga by a knockout in six. Jones finished the  year with another non-title fight, beating Fermin Chirino by decision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>In  1995, Jones defended his IBF Super Middleweight title successfully  three times, knocking out Antoine Byrd in round one, former Lightweight  and Junior Middleweight World Champion Vinny Pazienza in round six, and  Tony Thornton in round two.<br />
  </p>
  <p>1997 began with  more controversy for Jones. He suffered his first professional defeat  at the hands of Montell Griffin, losing his World Light Heavyweight  belt in the process. But the defeat was also filled with controversy,  because Jones had dropped Griffin with what appeared to be a legal  punch in round nine, and then hit him again on the head as Griffin was  on the canvas, leading to Jones Jr.'s disqualification. They had an  immediate rematch, and on August 21, Jones regained the World Light  Heavyweight Title by knocking out Griffin in the first round. By then,  Jones had signed a lucrative contract with HBO, to have all his fights  telecast on the HBO Boxing TV show.<br />
  </p>
  <p>In 2001, Jones released a rap CD,  his most noticeable song on it being <em>Ya'll Must've Forgot</em>,  probably referring to the fact that some critics who used to point him  out as the world's best fighter pound-for-pound were now criticizing  his quality of opposition. That year, he retained the title against  Derrick Harmon by a knockout in ten, and against future world champion  Julio Gonzalez of Mexico by a 12-round unanimous decision. There was  strong talk of Jones facing Felix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad in a super-fight, but  that possibility was soon forgotten after Trinidad was defeated by  Hopkins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>In 2002, Jones retained his title,  beating another grossly overmatched fighter,Glenn Kelly, by a knockout  in seven, famously dodging Kelly's punches while holding his hands  behind his back, mimicking one of his fighting game cocks, and then  unleashing a furious right hand that knocked out Kelly. He then  defeated Commonwealth of Nations champion of England Clinton Woods by a  knockout in six. Few in the US had ever heard of Woods before his fight  with Roy Jones. The Woods fight was held at the Rose Garden in  Portland, and it was, once again, the first time boxing had been held  at that venue, and also the first time in 45 years Portland had a world  title fight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Jones then announced he would  challenge John Ruiz for the WBA's World Heavyweight Championship. On  March 1 of 2003, he defeated Ruiz by a twelve-round unanimous decision  to become the first World Middleweight Champion in 106 years (after Bob  Fitzsimmons), and the second World Light Heavyweight Champion (after  Michael Spinks) to win a World Heavyweight title. At the time of the  fight, Lennox Lewis was regarded as the legitimate World Heavyweight  Champion and Ruiz was ranked as the #5 contender by Ring Magazine. The  day before the fight, people from Jones' and Ruiz's entourages became  involved in a press conference brawl, with Ruiz's manager requiring  hospitalization.</p>
  <p>Jones decided he wanted to keep campaigning as a Light-Heavyweight  and eventually relinquished the WBA Heavyweight title. On November 8,  2003, Jones recovered his old belt with a 12-round majority decision  over Antonio Tarver. This was a very close fight with Jones looking  sluggish and tired throughout. Tarver was able to catch him on the  ropes repeatedly but Jones, to his credit, fought bravely during the  championship rounds of the fight.<br />
</p>
  <p>On 15 May 2004 Jones faced a rematch with Antonio  Tarver. Despite the fact that Jones was heavily favoured to win, Tarver  knocked him out at 1:41 of the second round. This, Jones' first  unquestionable loss, sent shock waves through the boxing world. Jones  had won the first round, but in the second, as he was in a corner, was  caught by a big left hook by Tarver and knocked out. He tried to get  up, and did so with much effort, but was barely able to beat the count  of ten and was deemed unable to continue by referee Jay Nady.<br />
  </p>
  <p>On  25 September 2004 Jones attempted to win the IBF light heavyweight  title from Glencoffe Johnson in a match in Memphis, Tennessee. Johnson  knocked out Jones at 48 seconds into the ninth round. Jones laid on the  canvas for more than five minutes, a shocking sight to see for those  who had seen Jones dominate the competition for ten years. Johnson was  ahead on all three judges scorecards at the time of the knockout  (77-75, 77-75, 78-74) and had landed 118 punches to Jones's 75. Jones  used the ring's canvas that night as a billboard for his upcoming rap  CD, which came out on November 1.<br />
  </p>
  <p>After  almost a year away from the ring, focusing on training and working as  an analyst for HBO Boxing, Jones scheduled a rematch with Antonio  Tarver on October 1 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida,  which aired on HBO PPV. For the first time in his career, Jones was  considered an underdog going into the fight. Although he showed flashes  of confidence in the 4th and 5th rounds of the fight, Jones was  tentative to press the action and spent more time posturing than  fighting, as if afraid of being knocked out for the third straight  time. In the end, Tarver easily won a unanimous decision. In the  post-fight interview, Jones acknowledged that Tarver was the better  fighter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>After the loss, Jones quickly resumed  his duties as color commentator for HBO Championship Boxing, calling  the Floyd Mayweather Jr-Sharmba Mitchell fight on November 19, 2005 and  the Jermain Taylor-Bernard Hopkins rematch on December 3, 2005. His  return to the network was shortlived, as Jones was fired from his  ringside analyst role by HBO in January 2006 due to his reported lack  of commitment to attending production meetings for the network.</p>
