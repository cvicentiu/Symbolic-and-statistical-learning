<TABLE WIDTH=575><TR><TD>
<P><FONT size="+1"><B>Fairmont and St. Pauls could be county's best</B></FONT></P><I></I><P>ST. PAULS &#045; The Bulldogs raced out to a 10-2 record last season that stretched into the Robeson County Shootout before things went sour and the St. Pauls boys finished 15-9 for coach Harold Johnson.</P><P>A trio of key players have graduated &#045; Keron Pearson, an All-Robeson County first-teamer and Associated Press all-state nominee; Nikita Washington, a second-teamer; and Anthony Watson, an honorable mention &#045; and Johnson will be counting on another trio for this season&#039;s success in the Southeastern Conference.</P><P>That trio consists of Jerrell McKoy, a 6-foot, 4-inch senior center who averaged nine points and 8.0 rebounds per game last season; Greg Evans, a 6-0 senior guard who averaged 10 points and three assists per game; and Peyton Peterson, a 6-1 point guard.</P><P>&#8220I&#039;m really happy with this group of players,&#8221; coach Harold Johnson said. &#8220They work hard and they are just a good bunch.&#8221;</P><P>The Bulldogs opened their season Thursday with an overtime loss to East Columbus, 77-62, and will travel to Purnell Swett on Tuesday.</P><P>Red Springs</P><P>The Red Devils have lost 10 players to graduation from last season&#039;s 2-18 team, the biggest of which is Raheim Penn, an honorable mention player on The Robesonian&#039;s All-Robeson County team.</P><P>Penn especially made his presence known in the 2004 Robeson County Shootout, where he averaged 10.3 points per game and was an all-tourney selection.</P><P>But Glenn Patterson&#039;s squad returns a number of experienced players who are now seniors, including forward David Campbell, who averaged 8.1 points per game in the Robeson County Shootout for Red Springs. Also back for the Red Devils are center Jeremy Townsend, guard Cornelius Smith and guard Ratrell Mclean.</P><P>Up from the jayvee will be sophomores Stephan Johnson at guard, William Jackson at guard and Sameer Jackson at forward.</P><P>&#8220It&#039;s tough to replace some of the athletes we&#039;ve lost,&#8221; coach Glenn Patterson said. &#8220Plus, the success of the football team has put us behind a bit.&#8221;</P><P>The Red Devils will travel to Southern Lee High for a game on Tuesday.</P><P>Fairmont</P><P>After leading his team to a 16-9 record last season and a berth in the Tri-Six Conference finals, Fairmont coach Richard Mitchell has even loftier expectations for the Tornadoes this season.</P><P>With one look at his roster, which is returning three players named to the all-county or all-conference teams, it would be hard to blame him.</P><P>"I expect big things this season," Mitchell said. "We've got a lot of returning players and we're all expecting really big things."</P><P>The Tornadoes are returning seniors Darius Taylor, a 2004-05 first-team all-county selection; Thomas Townsend, a second-team selection; and junior Dorian Taylor, who received an honorable mention. Darius Taylor and Townsend were also named to the Tri-Six all-conference team.</P><P>Led by his trio of playmakers, Mitchell says this year's team will maintain his up-tempo offense.</P><P>"When you play Fairmont, you're going to have to wear your track shoes," Mitchell said, "because we're going to run. We're gonna get up and down the floor and try and pressure defenses."</P><P>The Tornadoes open their season Nov. 29 at West Brunswick.</P><P>South Robeson</P><P>Coming into the 2005-06 season, perhaps no team has lost as much as the South Robeson Mustangs.</P><P>In addition to losing the Robeson County Player of the Year, Demetrius Driggers, and a first-team all-conference selection, Brandon Bethea, to graduation, the Mustangs also lost the county's Coach of the Year, Travis Pait.</P><P>In his first and only season, Pait, who resigned his position earlier this month amid controversy, led the Mustangs to a 15-12 record last year and a berth in the state playoffs, the school&#039;s first since 1998.</P><P>The good news for the Mustang&#039;s new coach, though, is that despite the key losses, there won't be many holes to fill in his roster.</P><P>Although the 'Stangs lost Driggers and Bethea, they still have senior center Chris Fisher, an all-county honorable mention selection, to roam the paint, and several experienced guards to control the perimeter. In fact, half of the Mustangs' roster spots are occupied by seniors.</P><P>After two games, the Mustangs are 1-1.</P><P>TWO RIVERS CONFERENCE</P><P>Purnell Swett</P><P>This season will feel a lot like starting over for the Purnell Swett Rams.</P><P>Thomas Umphrey will coach his first season of basketball at Purnell Swett, and will only have one returning starter to work with.</P><P>Fortunately for him, the one returning starter is Marquell Pittman, a member of last year&#039;s All-Robeson County basketball team and a Shrine Bowl football player. The 6-3 forward will look to continue his success and bring at least one of his football teammates with him.</P><P>Junior Ferrell McIntyre, also a 6-3 receiver for the Rams gridiron squad, will move up to the varsity basketball team. Both Pittman and McIntyre have athleticism that&#039;s hard to match.</P><P>Jesse Locklear, Mike Jones and Justin Grady all have some experience playing varsity basketball even though none of them started last year. It will be up to them, as well as Pittman to help guide a very inexperienced team.</P><P>The Rams opened the season Tuesday, falling 54-51 to Hoke County. They survived a scare against South Robeson on Friday, winning 59-50. McIntyre led the Rams with 20 points against South Rob. Their next game will be Monday at Scotland County.</P><P>Lumberton</P><P>The Pirates lost last year&#039;s leading rebounder and All-Robeson County first-teamer Chris McEachern, who averaged more than 12 points and 11 rebounds per game last season.</P><P>But the Pirates will have senior Danmeon Campbell back to carry the load on offense. Campbell was second-team All-Robeson County last season after tallying 13.4 points per game.</P><P>The Pirates finished last season with a 16-11 record and lost to Wilmington Ashley in the first round of the state&#039;s Class 4-A playoffs.</P><P>Lumberton plays Tuesday when it hosts Scotland County.</P><P>- Staff writers W. Curt Vincent, Dennis Pillion and Willis Jacobson contributed to this preview.</P>
