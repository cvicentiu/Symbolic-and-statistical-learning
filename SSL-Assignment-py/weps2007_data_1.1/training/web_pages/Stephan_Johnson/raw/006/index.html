<font class=headline>Stephan Johnson dies at 31</font><br>

<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>
<font class=byline>
Associated Press<br><br>

</font>
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Stephan Johnson wanted to keep
boxing, even after a knockout sent him to the hospital last April.<p></p>
<p></p>

   His manager urged him to quit. So did his mother.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson said no.<p></p>
<p></p>

   His death Sunday at 31 from injuries in a Nov. 20 bout
underscored the price Johnson paid for ignoring those and other
warnings about his health.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson had hoped to make enough money in the ring to move his mother from the projects in Queens, N.Y.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "I always told him that there are other ways, he doesn't have
to risk his life," his mother, Ira Johnson, told The New York
Times last month. "There are other occupations. I wanted him to
get out of boxing."<p></p>
<p></p>

   Placed on medical suspension, he failed to take two of the three
neurological examinations needed to be removed from the Association
of Boxing Commissions suspension list, Ontario Athletics
Commissioner Ken Hayashi said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Still, he managed to get fights in Georgia and South Carolina
before his Nov. 20 junior middleweight bout in Atlantic City with
Paul Vaden. He was to make $10,000.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson was knocked out by Vaden and never regained
consciousness before he died Sunday.<p></p>
<p></p>

   An autopsy Monday showed he died of a "closed head injury and
left subdural hematoma with multiple complications," medical
examiner Dr. Hydow Park said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "If he'd had those tests, it might've made a big difference,"
Hayashi said Monday. "Fighters think the commissions are out to
bear down on them. But it's for their own health and safety. They
just throw caution to the wind. It's too bad."<p></p>
<p></p>

   Floored by two punches in the 10th round, Johnson was rushed to Atlantic City Medical Center. A day later, doctors drilled two
holes in his skull to siphon fluid in the hope of relieving
pressure.<p></p>
<p></p>

   He contracted pneumonia during the Thanksgiving weekend and
underwent a tracheotomy to help him breathe. He rallied briefly
last week -- a CAT scan showed reduced swelling -- but died about
5:45 p.m. Sunday.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "The Ring" boxing almanac estimates that Johnson was one of
four professional boxers worldwide to die from injuries in the ring
this year.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "It's just devastating whenever this happens to anybody in the
sport," said Craig Hamilton, Vader's co-manager. "It's a terrible
thing for him, for his family, for the sport."<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson, a journeyman 154-pounder who turned pro in 1987, was
hospitalized briefly after being knocked out by Fitz Vanderpool in
an April 14 fight in Toronto.<p></p>
<p></p>

   He underwent a CAT scan and was cleared to fight again. But
Canadian authorities put him on medical suspension, which is
standard for fighters who are stopped or knocked out.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson underwent a variety of tests aimed at measuring memory and motor skills to have his name removed from the suspension list.<p></p>
<p></p>

   He submitted only the CAT scan, however, and its results were
"borderline," Hayashi said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson remained on the suspension list compiled by Fight Fax
Inc. until September. But he managed to get licensed for an Aug. 7 fight in Greenville, S.C., which he won by decision.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Georgia's boxing commissioner said Monday that Johnson's name still appeared on the list Sept. 22, but it was taken off three
days later. Only then was he cleared for an Oct. 6 fight against
Calvin Moody in Albany, Ga., which Johnson won by a knockout,
commissioner Tom Mishou said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   He was not on the suspended list for his last fight.<p></p>

               Hayashi said South Carolina boxing authorities told Fight Fax to
remove him from the list. James Knight, a spokesman for the State
Athletic Commission, denied that. He also said Johnson passed
physicals, omitted any reference to the problems after his Toronto
fight and was cleared by South Carolina authorities.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "The commission, based on Mr. Johnson's statements and the
medical history on his application as well as the results of his
exams, felt he was in condition to fight," Knight said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   There was one question on the form Johnson completed Aug. 6 that asked whether there was any other information not covered by the
other questions, Knight said. Johnson left it blank. He was
examined by a certified physician, who cleared him, and he
submitted the results of a CT scan as part of his application.<p></p>
<p></p>

   In New Jersey, Johnson underwent a CAT scan, an
electrocardiograph and an eye test before the Vaden fight and
passed all three, the Athletic Control Board said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "He was fine," said Dr. Frank Doggett, a retired physician who
gave Johnson his heart exam during the physical. "His accident
occurred in the ring itself."<p></p>
<p></p>

   Johnson grew up in Brooklyn but lived in Queens. He billed
himself as being from Brooklyn because he thought it sounded
tougher, said his manager, Kenneth Woods.<p></p>
<p></p>

   He worked as a boxing instructor at Equinox Fitness Centers in
Manhattan, where he was known as a quiet, modest man who loved to
teach. The mood there was somber Monday, general manager David
Fowler said.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Employees and students had been planning a videotape of
greetings to be played in Johnson's hospital room. Instead, they
began collecting donations for his family.<p></p>
<p></p>

   Doggett, a former ringside physician, said such fatalities might
be inevitable.<p></p>
<p></p>

   "I don't know how you're going to prevent this type of
accident," he said. "Some people say helmets, but helmets aren't
going to prevent it. In all these years, they've never come up with
anything worthwhile."<br><br>
