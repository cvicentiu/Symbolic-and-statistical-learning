        Posted October 26, 2002<br>
        </strong><small><br>
        It has recently been revealed that a fighter named Juan Carlos Rubio was fighting under
        suspension when he scored a ten-round decision over prospect Francisco Bojado on February
        16 of this year - not for the first time, but for the second. The New Jersey commission
        had put Rubio on suspension on October 6, 2000, after his two-round KO loss to Teddy Reid,
        remarking that he &quot;needs EKG, CAT-scan, and neuro&quot;. <br>
        <br>
        In the interim, Rubio was permitted to fight in California on September 7, 2001, when he
        kayoed Luis Montes, and in Connecticut (at the Mohegan Sun Casino), when he registered the
        upset of the previously-unbeaten Bojado.<br>
        <br>
        Rubio's suspension had not been lifted, in fact, until October 10 of this year - one day
        before he fought Alejandro Jiminez in San Antonio. <br>
        <br>
        Clearly, neither the California commission nor the one in Connecticut had contacted Larry
        Hazzard's office in New Jersey, as required by federal law, in order to execute the steps
        necessary to take Rubio off the suspension list. And that was wrong. As Tim Lueckenhoff,
        the current president of the Association of Boxing Commissions told reporter Andre
        Courtemache, &quot;The federal law requires that all commissions honor medical
        suspensions. In this case Rubio should not have been allowed to fight.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        That's right, Tim. Non-communication among boxing commissions is a major problem. And I've
        got news for you - it has happened more often than you realize. Perhaps you want to place
        a call to Harrisburg and ask one of your colleagues about it. Better yet - let me save you
        the long distance charges. <br>
        <br>
        Accompany me, if you will, on a trip back in time................<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It was an otherwise lazy Sunday morning - April 30 of 2000, to be precise. I had just
        finished updating the links on &quot;The Fight Page&quot;, when I spotted a rather strange
        e-mail message in my bin.<br>
        <br>
        A commission administrator from Georgia - a man named Tom Mishou - was writing me to
        discuss a matter that he felt carried some degree of importance. <br>
        <br>
        Mishou had noticed that on the Fox Sunday Night Fight series that evening, a boxer named
        Santiago Samaniego was being matched against Kenny Ellis, in a fight that was to take
        place in conjunction with the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Ill. <br>
        <br>
        Mishou communicated to me that Samaniego was at that time suspended by his commission
        (Georgia) - the result of a TKO loss to Vernon Forrest the previous August in which
        Samaniego had incurred an eye injury, and that he (Mishou) had not received as much as a
        courtesy call from the Illinois commission in order to take the fighter off the suspension
        list, as was required by Federal law. <br>
        <br>
        Not only that, but this was the third time this had happened with Illinois.<br>
        <br>
        And I'll tell you the funny thing about that - I had seen Samaniego's name on at least one
        America Presents press release during the previous week, and while fishing around the
        ABC's suspension list, looking for someone else, I had run across Samaniego, with two
        references next to his name - one for the medical suspension in Georgia, the other for
        failure to renew a Federal ID card. I was considering putting together a short story on
        this apparent snafu.<br>
        <br>
        So it was like &quot;deja vu&quot; that Mishou had made his attempt to contact me.<br>
        <br>
        In subsequently chatting with Mishou, and taking a look the Professional Boxer Safety Act
        of 1996, I found him to be exactly correct. I also found him to be very straight-forward;
        someone who did things by the book and who knew exactly who to operate, both by law and by
        protocol.<br>
        <br>
        Recognizing that the sport of boxing had just gone through a ring tragedy with the death
        of Stephan Johnson, and that there seem to be varying degrees of respect among commissions
        (generally in relation to how much boxing takes place there), I decided to write a piece
        that illustrated what seemed to be a spirit of non-cooperation and non-communication among
        commissions who were supposed to showing a spirit of unity.<br>
        <br>
        The last few lines of my story read like this:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Now, I have no doubt that Samaniego has renewed his Federal ID card. Renewal is a
        mere formality, and you simply can't fight without it. But the question is, how does he
        have the Federal ID card - in effect, a passport to fight, which is administered under the
        authority of the ABC - if he has the existing suspension on his record, and it has not
        been erased by an ABC-member commission? It indicates that perhaps someone is asleep at
        the wheel. And it's an issue I'm going to ask the ABC's Greg Sirb (at that time president
        of the organization) to answer to. Before the next Stephan Johnson meets an ugly
        fate.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Well, apparently Greg Sirb didn't feel too comfortable being answerable to ANYONE. And so
        either he subsequently contacted Larry Hamel of the Chicago Sun-Times, or Hamel contacted
        him - I don't know, or care, how that chain of events went.<br>
        <br>
        The end result of their communication was a piece by Hamel which appeared in the Sun-Times
        a few days later, in which he essentially criticized me for the story, inferring that I
        basically lied in my assessment of the situation.<br>
        <br>
        I can assure anyone who reads the piece with any comprehension whatsoever that this wasn't
        the case, and that there is very little room for misinterpretation. Unfortunately, Hamel
        misinterpreted it - completely.<br>
        <br>
        His story contains a quote from Sirb, alleging my story simply wasn't true:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Illinois correctly followed procedure,&quot; Sirb said. &quot;The fighter was not on
        suspension,&quot;&nbsp; followed by Hamel's own ill-informed opinion:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Sure, it's fashionable to turn over rocks looking for corruption in boxing, but it
        helps if the facts support the story.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Whether he was directed by Sirb to do so or not, the poor schmuck Hamel, incredibly,
        sought to blame GEORGIA:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;If there is fault to be assigned, and I question whether any should be, wouldn't it
        be more appropriate to blame the folks in Georgia for issuing such an ambiguously written
        condition as &quot;DOC MUST OK LEFT EYE&quot;?<br>
        <br>
        Obviously this guy wasn't too familiar with the ABC's suspension list.<br>
        <br>
        The most interesting thing about all this is that the morning after Samaniego's fight, I
        went to the suspension list. Sure enough, the name Santiago Samaniego had been taken
        completely off the list, as though it had never been there in the first place. I
        immediately called Mishou. He told me he had not officially taken Samaniego off suspension
        yet, because although he was expecting it, he had not yet received any materials or
        notification from Illinois that would have led him to do so (he did later that day). <br>
        <br>
        That left me with just one conclusion as to who had done it................<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        So just a couple of days after Hamel's story, during which time I had numerous talks with
        Mishou, I fired off the following letter to Sirb:<br>
        <br>
        ___________________________________________________________________________<br>
        </small><br>
        <em><br>
        <strong><small>Mr. Sirb,<br>
        <br>
        In my limited conversations with you I have found you to be most amicable and forthcoming.
        At the same time, though, I feel you were being rather disingenuous in your quotes to
        Larry Hamel of the Chicago Sun-Times with regard to Santiago Samaniego. I get the
        impression from these comments that 1) you unilaterally decided Samaniego was off
        suspension, and 2) that my report was a lie. </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Yet in checking with Tom Mishou of Georgia, who is probably the most
        straightforward person I have met in boxing, he tells me that his jurisdiction still had
        Samaniego under suspension as of the time of his Sunday fight, citing lack of any
        notification or consultation with him AS THE SUSPENDING JURISDICTION as per Section 7,
        4-B-b-1 of the Professional Boxing (sic) Safety Act of 1996, which is the enabling
        legislation of the ABC, is it not?<br>
        <br>
        Because Mishou levied the suspension, I would tend to consider his ruling as the ONLY
        valid one in this case, and if other commissions had not followed the proper procedure
        WITH HIM, no decisions made by commissions, doctors, your office, or anyone else really
        means a thing, in terms of the strictest adherence to the Federal law in effect.
        Unfortunately, Mr. Hamel did not do a very good job of reporting; he felt it not
        necessary, for some reason, to make an effort to contact Mr. Mishou regarding the
        suspension HE imposed and STILL had in effect, at least officially on the record.<br>
        <br>
        That having been said, I have some direct questions for you:<br>
        <br>
        -- Do you have the authority to overrule the medical suspensions of your member state
        commissions unilaterally, and without notification, whether written or verbal, to the
        suspending commission? In other words, is there some kind of amendment to the governing
        law that I am not aware of?<br>
        <br>
        -- Do state commissions have the authority to unilaterally lift suspensions imposed by
        other commissions, without regard to procedures as set forth in the Professional Boxing
        Safety Act?<br>
        <br>
        -- If medical suspensions on the part of one commission are not followed TO THE LETTER by
        other commissions, and if such commissions are not compelled to honor them in reciprocal
        fashion, what purpose is there for the ABC's existence?<br>
        <br>
        -- Did Santiago Samaniego appeal to the ABC for direct action in lifting the suspension,
        as is provided for in Section 7, 4-B-b-2 of the Professional Boxing Safety Act, and if
        so.................<br>
        What were the &quot;insufficient grounds&quot; under which you overturned his suspension?
        What &quot;improper purposes&quot; were cited in the Georgia suspension? Why wasn't
        written notification given? <br>
        <br>
        If so, do you have written notarized documentation of such an appeal? And would you be
        kind enough to furnish it to me?<br>
        <br>
        My guess is that there was no appeal, since I can't imagine any grounds under which
        Samaniego could successfully file it. And the appeal, while provided for, is for
        extraneous circumstances at best.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        -- You are quoted in the Hamel article as stating that Illinois &quot;used proper
        procedures&quot; in clearing Samaniego to fight. Let me quote verbatim from the
        Professional Boxing Safety Act --<br>
        <br>
        Section 7, 4-B-b-1<br>
        <br>
        &quot;1) for any reason other than those listed in subsection (a) if such commission
        notifies in writing and consults with the designated official of the suspending State's
        boxing commission prior to the grant of approval for such individual to participate in
        that professional boxing match&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Subsection (a) refers to conditions under which a boxer can revoke a suspension. But in
        cases of suspensions from another state, they STILL must provide this critical
        notification to the suspending commission. And that certainly is the case in Georgia. I'm
        sure you have a copy of their regulations on file. <br>
        <br>
        Given these parameters, did Illinois really follow &quot;proper procedure&quot; in
        allowing Samaniego to fight, not once, not twice, but THREE times? Did Nevada? I can
        assure you they never contacted the suspending commission, because the suspending
        commissioner TOLD ME they didn't. And unless Tom Mishou is flat-out lying to me, it's
        really a cut-and-dried issue, isn't it?<br>
        <br>
        Honestly, I think all of us can agree that Samaniego was physically fit to fight.
        Samaniego, in this specific instance, was not the big issue. In fact, no one was looking
        to prevent him from fighting. <br>
        <br>
        I'm more concerned with the bigger picture. When Stephan Johnson was suspended by the
        Ontario commission, with their own requests for contact from other commissions, were they
        not ignored? Did Stephan Johnson not pass all the &quot;required&quot; tests in South
        Carolina and New Jersey, thereby creating the facade that he was in proper physical
        condition and ready to fight? And did Stephan Johnson not die from ring injuries that
        could have been avoided had one commission decided to &quot;follow proper procedure&quot;
        and contact another?<br>
        <br>
        Here's an excerpt from a Toronto Star story, published while Johnson was still fighting
        for his life:<br>
        <br>
        .............&quot;Ontario athletics commissioner Ken Hayashi said yesterday he'd received
        billing from Johnson for only a CAT scan, so Johnson was still technically suspended when
        he won fights in South Carolina in August and another in Georgia in October before taking
        the fateful fight last month in New Jersey. <br>
        <br>
        ``South Carolina took the radiologist's report and took him off the suspended list. . . .
        They should have checked (with Ontario) first,'' Hayashi said. ``And I know I wouldn't
        have released the suspension based on that report (the CAT scan alone). . . . Basically,
        any state commission is not supposed to let any fighter fight while he's under medical
        suspension. That's an American federal law - out of courtesy they would observe our
        Canadian suspension.'' <br>
        <br>
        Added Hayashi: ``Nobody thought to call me. I'm disappointed. (But) with the amount of
        fights going on, it can happen. I would have advised them not to let him fight. I wouldn't
        have released my suspension (based) on that radiologist's report
        alone.''........................<br>
        <br>
        Different injuries? Yes. Greater severity? Certainly. But the same potential
        cause-and-effect -- no communication, no reciprocation, no respect among boxing
        commissions that are supposed to be fighting for the same cause - fighter safety. Sure,
        there was no real danger with Samaniego. But perhaps next time a commission ignores
        &quot;proper procedure&quot; there will be a more tragic effect. Do we have to wait for
        that next time to happen?<br>
        <br>
        How many more Stephan Johnsons do we need?<br>
        <br>
        Why can't we, for once, be PRO-active, instead of RE-active? Why should we wait for a
        tragedy to strike before taking steps to prevent others? Let's take the pre-emptive steps
        now, and let's make it an item for discussion at your annual meeting in Denver in July. <br>
        <br>
        There's no place in boxing for individual jurisdictions, not to mention an umbrella
        organization (ABC), who eschew the very rules they have established, for the sake of
        convenience. And there is no room for apologists after the fact. Sadly, Mr. Hamel did not
        understand this &quot;greater issue&quot; when he wrote his unfortunate Chicago Sun-Times
        piece. I'm hoping, for the sake of the sport, that YOU do.<br>
        <br>
        Your prompt response to my direct questions would be greatly appreciated. <br>
        <br>
        And oh by the way, one day after the Samaniego-Ellis fight, which was also one day after
        my piece on Samaniego ran (not coincidentally, I'm guessing), Tom Mishou informed me that
        his office FINALLY received the required medical reports to facilitate his rescindment of
        Samaniego's suspension. <br>
        <br>
        Under different circumstances, it could have been a day too late. <br>
        <br>
        Think about it.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,<br>

        <br>
        I meant it then. I mean it now.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>And for the record, I couldn't care less whether Stephon Johnson's fatal injuries
        had anything to do with a previous ring injury. The NON-COMMUNICATION between these
        commissions is the material issue to me. The bottom line is that shirking responsibilities
        can create more situations that put a fighter in peril.<br>
        <br>
        What I found ironic, and at the same time rather pathetic, was that I had to actually
        school the reigning president of the Association of Boxing Commissions on what the federal
        law was - even if I did not quite call it by its correct name. <br>
        <br>
        Another thing that is extremely important to note is that when I ask questions like I
        asked in the letter, I'm not interested in anything but an e-mail response; that way,
        there can be no mistaking what is asked or answered. Verbatim questions and quotes offer
        the best protection to BOTH parties - I deal with Bob Yalen of ESPN the same way, since I
        refuse to yield to the network's requirement that interviews with him be
        &quot;chaperoned&quot; by one of its PR people.<br>
        <br>
        It is not inconsequential to acknowledge that although I didn't have a particular feeling
        about him, one way or another, it had been recommended to me that this was the best way to
        nail Sirb down to a quote that couldn't possibly be denied later.<br>
        <br>
        Well, I've never received an answer to my questions - to this day.<br>
        <br>
        My point to this whole thing is two-fold -- 1) If you're the president of a national
        organization, even a trade association (the ABC) devoted in some way to the regulation of
        boxing, it is imperative that you know the federal law, and tragic if you don't; and 2)
        Not to sound too arrogant about it, but if you're going to contradict me on something like
        this - in public - it's best to be about one-thousand percent correct.<br>
        <br>
        So I came away from the experience wondering - isn't it odd that there wasn't an awareness
        of the federal laws concerning boxing, that anyone would circumvent those laws to cover up
        for a mistake made by others, and that someone would misrepresent proper procedure in
        talking to a reporter?<br>
        <br>
        And ever since, I'm asking myself if those are the kinds of things we're looking for in a
        &quot;national boxing czar&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Maybe John McCain or Ken Nahigian can come up with an answer to that.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Also interesting - about 4-1/2 months after all this had happened, I was sitting in a
        Miami Beach coffee shop, having breakfast with Marc Ratner, executive director of the
        Nevada commission. At the outset of our conversation, he mentioned to me that he had just
        gone through a situation with a tribal commission in Washington where he had to be
        notified before releasing Roberto Duran to fight. Duran was on an active suspension in
        Nevada as a result of his August 1998 title bout against William Joppy, and Ratner pointed
        out that by federal law, he had to give consent for Duran to take part in any contest.<br>

        Ding, ding, ding!<br>

        Keeping in mind that Nevada was one of the states that had let Samaniego fight while he
        was suspended by Georgia, I asked Ratner if he now understood the point I was trying to
        make back on April 30.<br>
        <br>
        He acknowledged he did.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        And here's the post-script on Larry Hamel, to give you an idea of what &quot;command&quot;
        he has over his subject matter - <br>
        <br>
        In a June 1 column, in which he was trying to explain that the Ali Act would actually HURT
        fighters, Hamel wrote, &quot;The act, which passed both the Senate and the House and has
        been sent to President Clinton, would place a one-year limit on the length of contracts
        between promoters and fighters.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Well, anyone who has read what was posted at TotalAction knows that the Ali Act doesn't
        say that at all - what it says is that &quot;coercive&quot; contracts, i.e., contracts
        with options, usually as a result of title fights, can not last more than one year. <br>
        <br>
        Just another case of a &quot;boxing writer&quot; who either doesn't know HOW to read, or
        WHAT to read.<br>
        <br>
        Mercifully, Hamel has been taken off the boxing beat by the Sun-Times. <br>

        <small>By the way, Larry, I'm told I turn up some pretty good rocks.</small><br>

        Finally, in perhaps the most ironic twist of all, it was the first week of August and I
        was looking at a fight schedule, when I noticed that Santiago Samaniego was slated to
        fight on August 10 in Marseille, France, against welterweight contender Mamadou Thiam.
        When I poked around a little further I found that Samaniego was, as of that date, under an
        indefinite suspension in the state of Texas, and an &quot;ID card&quot; suspension in
        California. <br>
        <br>
        This is what the entry looked like:<br>
        <br>
        <em>Samaniego, Santiago (FL006244) TX 01/21/01 indefinite<br>
        Samaniego, Santiago (FL006244) CA 12/07/01 must renew Fed ID card<br>
        </em><br>
        Well, despite these sanctions, Samaniego wound up having his fight, and in fact, came from
        behind to knock Thiam out, claiming the WBA &quot;interim&quot; junior middleweight crown.<br>
        <br>
        Naturally, I sat there wondering - did someone illegally erase THAT suspension too, just
        to spite me?<br>
        <br>
        Hmmmmmmm.<br>
