		<p><font color="blue" size="4" font>Silent Steel : The Mysterious Death of the 
Nuclear Attack Sub USS Scorpion<br>
by Stephen Johnson</font> <br>
USS Scorpion, a 3500-ton Skipjack class nuclear-powered attack submarine built 
at Groton, Connecticut, was commissioned in July 1960. Assigned to the Atlantic 
Fleet, she took part in the development of contemporary submarine warfare 
tactics and made periodic deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and other areas 
where the presence of a fast and stealthy submarine would be beneficial. 
Scorpion began another Mediterranean cruise in February 1968. The following May, 
while homeward bound from that tour, she was lost with her entire crew some 400 
miles southwest of the Azores. In late October 1968, her remains were found on 
the sea floor over 10,000 feet below the surface by a towed deep-submergence 
vehicle deployed from USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11). Photographs taken then and later 
showed that her hull had suffered fatal damage while she was running submerged 
and that even more severe damage occurred as she sank. The cause of the initial 
damage continues to generate controversy more than three decades later. 
(Excerpt: history.navy.mil) A new book Silent Steel due to release in December 
2005 is an investigative journey of over 500 interviews, recently released data, 
personal archives and never before seen photographs on the USS Scorpion tragedy. 
Stephen Johnson the author of Silent Steel is a newspaper journalist with over 
25 years experience and author of several other books. He has covered a myriad 
of news stories from homicides to politics and military events. In a 
correspondence with The Sub Report, Johnson shares the following about his new 
book: &quot;In 1987 I was telephoned by a former Scorpion electrician's mate named 
Dan Rogers who told me of how much he hated serving aboard the Scorpion. He was 
angered to learn that people believed the Scorpion had been sunk by its own 
torpedo. He ultimately got transferred from the boat by disqualifying himself 
from submarine duty only to be placed aboard another submarine due to the 
shortage of nuclear-trained sailors. Rogers drew me into the story of the 
Scorpion, though I didn't write anything until 1993 when a less classified 
version of the inquiry transcripts became available.&quot; &quot;Even Rogers did not 
realize how complicated the Scorpion's story was, although I credit him with 
making me aware of this unresolved mystery.&quot; &quot;In 1994 SUBLANT at first claimed 
it did not have the maintenance records of the Scorpion, but accidentally 
discovered they had not been destroyed as they believed and they were forced by 
the CNO to turn them over to me. I wrote an additional story outlining the odd 
circumstances surrounding the Scorpion's final overhaul which was drastically 
reduced.&quot; &quot;After writing a couple of general interest books with the last one 
being an engineering history called the Encyclopedia of Bridges and Tunnels, 
Wiley asked me to write a book on the Scorpion in 2002. This has been a nearly 
three-year effort to tell the story of this ill-fated boat.&quot; &quot;My view of this 
disaster deviates from the position held by many who are convinced they have 
&quot;the answer.&quot; I don't know what happened to the Scorpion, but the story behind 
her finals days, her loss, the investigation and the miraculous effort to find 
her is astonishing.&quot; Some reviews from Amazon.com &quot;The magnitude of the tragedy 
of the USS Scorpion is matched only by the depth of the mystery surrounding her 
loss. Stephen Johnson has done a remarkable job of shining new light on this 
dark moment in U.S. submarine history.&quot;- Sherry Sontag, co-author, Blind Man's 
Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage 
------------------------------------------------------ &quot;Stephen Johnson has 
crafted a forensic masterpiece that leads the reader back through time to 
unravel the gnawing enigma of the tragic 1968 loss of the nuclear attack 
submarine USS Scorpion. Sifting through a maze of conflicting theories, he 
meticulously lays out a tale of undersea detectives searching for conclusive 
evidence to one of the most baffling mysteries of the cruel sea.&quot; -- Rear 
Admiral Thomas Evans, author, analyst specializing in submarine history and 
operations, and former officer on the Scorpion 
----------------------------------------------------- &quot;The manuscript arrived 
with yesterday's afternoon mail. I finished reading it by nightfall. It's that 
good! Thoroughly researched, impeccably documented, with an appealing and 
literate style, Silent Steel should become essential reading for submarine 
enthusiasts and for anyone else who enjoys an engaging and informative yarn.&quot; -A.J.
