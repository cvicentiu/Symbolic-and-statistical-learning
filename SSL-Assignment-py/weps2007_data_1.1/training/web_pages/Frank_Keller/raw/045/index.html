Frank KellerThis is my best written reference to date and comes from an event where Bell West hired me for a nominal fee, and sold readings to their employees at a reduced rate with the proceeds going to the United Way.  The following is an excerpt from Christine's letter of reference.     Thanks Christine!"I received a great deal of positive feedback about Frank from many employees who attended one of his sessions.  He acts in a professional manner and takes his occupation very serious.  He was so good, we asked him back for a second time to do some readings for the employees that missed him the first time around and he will definitely be asked to come back in the future.If you are thinking of hiring Frank for a party, fundraiser or corporate event I guarantee you will be very impressed.  The following are some first hand testimonials that I received after some employees had their sessions with Frank":Christine Purdy  Bell West  United Way Fundraiser…           " I was nervous going in to see Frank, only because I had heard how good he was.  Everything I heard was true.  It was the most eye-opening experience in a short 10 minutes!  Frank knew things about me that only I did…and he was able to tell me why I did what I did in my life.  I'd go see him again and again…""I read my own tarot cards.  Frank knows what the combination represent and told me things like the fact that I grew up with a single mom and what was currently going on in my relationships.  Can you tell that by looking at a person?  I don't think so.""Frank is Amazing!  He knows things about me that I wouldn't tell my mother.  After seeing Frank, I feel a lot better about myself…He totally uplifted my spirit.  I definitely recommend him."The history and origins of Tarot and Palm readings predate the Ancient Egyptians. They both provide ways of exploring the circumstances surrounding our life and bringing us to an understanding of the forces that affect us.  The philosophy of Tarot is that of ancient symbols and our inherent response to them, our natural knowing,  in cohesion with the Natural Law that the "universe is always unfolding in a fashion to fully explain it's self".  There are no accidents, everything happens for a reason.  No matter how you choose the card, the card tells the right story.Palm readings are similar in that the idea is all our energy moves through our hands and shapes our hands like a river shapes its bed.  Hand reading is  used to analyze our basic personality and character.  Our hands also reveal personal assets and liabilities, allowing us to realize previously unknown potentials as well as disclosing fates and outcomes previously chosen.  Everything is shown in the hands.Frank Keller's expertise is shown in his ability to read the Backside of your Hand as well as the lines of your palm.  The advantage to which is seen every time someone shows their hands. and is an incredible tool for any persons involved in sales or negotiations.  Once the hand is seen it can be read, nothing is secret after that.  Frank has read hundreds of hands through photos and web cam images.  Ask him if you want to learn how.A Tarot Reading is an in-depth, accurate way of studying our motivations, past present and future experiences.  It also reveals the fundamentals of our relationships with our parents and the roles they play, as well as how we handle money.  Tarot is the living example of a Metaphor.   There are many individual practices and ideologies, I however analyze these influences with the aid of Jungian philosophy and my own life The Transformational Arts refers to the process when we ascend from one level of consciousness to another.  When we learn from our experience, and mature emotionally, mentally and spiritually.  This is a process of discovering and discerning the truth, which me must then apply to our lives.To do all this we must look at how we have evolved from an innocent, idealize child, only to be molded by our environment and reactions to it, and became the person we are today.  Facing that reality, we can learn to see how our actions will affect our future.  Change is achieved through the process of understanding the truth, making our choices becomes extremely clear.Thus we begin to understand ourselves and gain an understanding of the circumstances around us.  We must finally come to face the difference between perspective and reality.The true art is to discover a process that is natural and allows us to understand and resolve our emotions enabling us to flow with life.Frank Keller has resided in Calgary since 1970 and is currently 40 years old.  Attending St. Augustins Elementary & Jr. High and Henry WiseWood Senior High,  he chose not to graduate after fully experiencing both educational systems.  Born an Aquarius Frank strongly resisted "being taught" and has learned on his own with little formal study.  More accurately he has learned through the process of studying other people and his own inner most nature.  He proudly say's "I've completed fewer than 50 books".  Please note, to date, Frank has performed more than 27,000 individual readings.   At 24 years old (1987) Frank accidentally began a process of self discovery, awareness and actualization through an experiential form of Jungian psychology.  After ten years and many life changes, by "chance", on an impulse Frank bought his first set of Tarot cards.  Within six months he became employed as a psychic reader on a 900 line and provided more than 14,000 telephone readings in his first three years. After his very first telephone reading he knew he had found his life path. "Even with all the heavy changes, my first three years reading where my most transformational."  In March 1999 he established his reading "shop" called The Art of Tarot on trendy 17th Avenue and in July began his own Psychic 900 Service.  His plans include an International Service employing more than 20 readers.Having a diligent nature, Frank has worked since he was twelve with a paper route, trucking company and at 18, hired on with the CPR as a Brakeman.  In 11 years he worked his way to Conductor and Locomotive Engineer.  In that time he volunteered with the Union serving in various positions.  He was also active on the Employees Assistance Committee serving as Secretary for his last year.  Prior to his psychic endeavors Frank spent 3 years selling life insurance, mutual funds and financial products, which seemingly put some of the final touches on his "Material" education.  Frank concedes, "there was a lot of formal training in those twelve years and many experiences better than school". Frank has written over 1000 poems, and countless short stories and articles since 1997.  He uses this writing to reflect on the reader his impressions of the world, his emotional center and personal beliefs.  What follows are several selections from his published work.  The River is ExtremeLike golden water fire on the sunlit moonHoneysuckle rainbows as your lipsMouth the tuneSinging like an angelStarbursts on the groundAn ever contradicting storyAs what's lostIs foundA contradicting storyThe quiet of the soundLike solid wet crystal honeyPouring on the ground..Light streaks and rays of lightGlowing flakes in the sunLike rain that gently flutters downA force of gravity will succumbLike solid wet crystal honeyMelting in the sunEverything keeps coming aroundUntil it's done.There's a sound that comes from distant soulsLike the roar of the oceans forever oldThere's a gust of wind with uprooted treesAnd a million flapping wings the call of the geeseThere's a fire that burns hot embers and molten coreA raging desire to learn of you moreThere's a lake as calm as a sleeping baby's peaceWhere the waters are warm and endlessly deepThere's a heart the beats like heaven's thunder drumListening brings reliefCloser to succumbThe heavens have a hammer ringing like a gongThe angels have their gentlenessExpressed in your songThe elements have mixed an alchemical stewNot much left having looked at youYou're fire and brimstoneLightning at the coreWhat am I supposed to doYour voice is in my bones and my soul calls for more.A nightingale sings her panting hearts quipLooking across the room trying to keep her gripLooking in his eyes his sun filled glowing hairSomething so unsettled peeling round and staredSomething seemed so glowingSomething in the airSomething when she clichéd her fingers   Waved them through her hairA psychic shock wave sizzled   Electrifying the airAll that one could see   Sudden plain and fair   Golden strands of starlight hair The Art of Tarot offers both a Walk in Service and Online Readings providing in depth character and life analysis through Tarot and Palm readings.My primary intention is to provide a firm understanding through which individuals are able to examine and accept themselves and to easily move through any emotions encountered.  This is the Ancient Art of "Alchemy" & "Transcendence" as well as a path to enlightenment.1-877-331-9397
