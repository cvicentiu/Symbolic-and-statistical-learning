<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font color="#408080">Suspense/Mystery. Frank Keller (Pacino) is an NYPD homicide detective investigating
    a string of killings. All the victims were men who put rhyming ads in the personals, so
    Keller and his partner Sherman (John Goodman) put in an ad of their own. They go out on
    dates with all the women who answer the ad. Soon Keller finds himself having a steamy
    affair with one of the suspects, Helen (Ellen Barkin).</font></p>

<p align="left"><i><font color="#000080" size="3">Movieline article on the 10
All-Time Greatest Movie Kisses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></i></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">
A kiss can be a beginning, an end, a lie. Some kisses are so intense
  that there is no tomorrow. These are kisses that never leave you, no matter how long you
  live; kisses that come out of the deep passion of loneliness rather than love. As a rule
  such kisses get you into trouble. <strong><em><a
  href="pac_sol4.jpg"><img
  src="pac_sol4.jpg" width="106" height="150"
  align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a></em></strong>But they're also the only kind
  that really matter. Sea of Love has one of those kisses. Al Pacino is a middle-aged,
  divorced, alcoholic, New York cop on the hunt for a serial killer who responds to men's
  personal ads and then shoots the individuals who've placed them. Ellen Barkin is a
  divorced toughie who talks of &quot;animal attraction&quot; and sees a world full of male
  &quot;creeps&quot; and &quot;manipulators&quot;. She's also Pacino's number one suspect.
  But that mass of honey hair, those asymmetrical lips, the beckoning eyes-he can't deny
  her. Thus, eventually, the kiss. It's 3 a.m. in Pacino's bachelor apartment. They're
  boozy, all over each other. He pins her against the wall, but it is really she who's the
  aggressor. Animal-like she attacks with her lips, then pulls back in a moment of
  indecision and stalks around the room until she makes up her mind, at which point she
  flings off her jacket and comes at him. Boosting herself up, she clamps her legs around
  his waist, letting him bury his face in her chest. Part of her, though, is watching from
  some remove, fighting her own lack of control as he seeks refuge in her from all the cop
  shit that has claimed his life. A kiss, a killer, the urgent need of two lonely people. A
  simple change up for the traditional femme fatale? Maybe. For the moment, Pacino doesn't
  care. One of those kisses that really matter has hold of him. He's ignoring the
  possibility that this creature with a mouth could be the killer he's been pursing, and
  that she could be his own killer too. Those who like their sex dangerous on cold, rainy
  nights understand. <i>Movieline, Feb 2000</i> </font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Teasing about Barkin's Strip&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does Al Pacino measure up to Ellen Barkin's other on screen lovers?
  Certainly the duo generates enough screen chemistry to rival infamous sessions with Dennis
  Quaid in the 1987 hit &quot;The Big Easy&quot;. In a memorable mock-cop interrogation,
  Barkin strips down as she pins Pacino against the wall. Then she whispers, mock-tough,
  'What are you looking for?&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barkin points out that she always gets queried about the sex scene and
  Pacino doesn't. &quot;And he doesn't even take off his clothes,&quot; she says
  exasperatedly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was intentional,&quot; Pacino says.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Her without her clothes and me with my clothes on was part of an
  idea we had. It's got a twist to it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><i><font color="#000080">Interview with Richard Price, screenwriter for Sea of
Love for &quot;Movieline&quot;, by F.X. Feeney. I don't know the date. (I've only included
the Al-related excerpts)</font></i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font size="3"><b>
Q: &quot;What about when the story gets altered
  to fit the marketplace and actually becomes less of a story? </b></font> <font size="3"><br>
  A: The illusion is, &quot;Gee, if were a director I'd have more power.&quot; That's false,
  The director is just as much under the gun. Take Sea of <i>Love. </i>There's not one word
  in it that I didn't write, but when I saw it, I was all freaked out-I never mean it to be
  a &quot;thriller.&quot; I mean it to be two hours of high mopery. Very angsty. It probably
  would not have had as big an audience. I might have been more literate. More original. But
  hey, I'm working with Universal. It got shoehorned into a thriller-mode so that they could
  sell it. So you think, &quot;That fuckin' director- that fuckin' Casey Silver, that
  fuckin' Universal, that fuckin' Marty Bregman, that fuckin' Al Pacino.&quot; But to come
  back to Harold Becker, the director, the illusion is that Harold could have made any kind
  of picture he wanted to. And yet he's just as much under the gun in that editing room and
  behind that camera, to make Universal happy, as anybody. And I wouldn't have shot the
  picture anywhere near as good. My thing would have looked like you'd just held a script to
  the camera and flipped the pages. Follow the bouncing ball. What do I know? So thought to
  myself, &quot;Grow up. You want the money, I want the big studio, you want the
  accessibility, you want the star system - that's the price.&quot;<br>
</font><b><font size="3">Q: How did <i>Sea of Love </i>get turned into a
  thriller?</font></b><font size="3"><strong><em><a href="pac_sol1.jpg"><img
  src="pac_sol1.jpg" width="119" height="150"
  align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a></em></strong><b><br>
  </b>A: My first draft was naive. Dustin Hoffman was going play it but by the time I
  completed the draft, he was al tangled up with <i>Rain Man. So I </i>became the writer on <i>Rain
  Man </i>for six weeks, )but then I quit, because I 1couldn't stand it. After that, things
  kind of cooled between us, and he decided to back away from <i>Sea of Love. </i>And then I
  just hand delivered it to Al Pacino, myself. In this first draft, the woman character did
  not come in until pages - 90. It was all like, &quot;Woe is me,&quot; for 90 pages of
  really good scenes, but it was a character study. And then, finally, when this guy can't
  stand it anymore, he runs into Miss Wrong, and the whole thing happens in one explosive
  night. The last 15 minutes of the movie are him saying, &quot;I don't care if I die, I've
  got to get laid, I've got to have some contact.&quot; So all this Did-She-orDidn't-She was
  shoved to the end. So everybody says to me, &quot;Hey, the babe doesn't come in till 90,
  who are we going to get for that? She's got to be there from the giddyap.&quot; So I says,
  &quot;All right, but not from page one. How about if I bring her in at 30? &quot; They
  said okay-finally-but even then they were kind of hinky about it. Now, the point is, if
  I've got a story where the organic structure of it is that the woman comes in on page 90,
  and all of I can't tell you --&nbsp; sudden I've got to bring her in on 30, what the fuck
  am I going to do with her for 60 pages? That's when I had to spin a whole line of
  Did-She-or-Didn't-She bullshit.<b><br>
Q: Were you completely alienated from, the project at
  that point? </b><br>
  A: I no longer felt involved with it. What do they say? Comedy is Tragedy plus Time?
  Everybody's telling me I've got to turn my movie into <i>Fatal Attraction. </i>Next thing
  I know, about year later, I'm at a party and I run into James Dearden - the guy that wrote
  <i>Fatal Attraction. </i>And I said, &quot;Oh. So you're the prick who wrote that thing. I
  can't tell you how miserable that made my life, I had to make my story like yours.&quot;
  And he said, &quot;Look. I've just got a job directing a movie&quot; - I forget the title,
  something with Matt Dillon and Sean Young - &quot;and everybody's telling me I've got to
  make it like <em>&quot;Sea of Love&quot;.</em></font><b><font size="3"><br>
Q:</font></b> <font size="3"> <b>You've partly answered this by discussing
  your research methods, but when I asked, &quot;What does this do to your head?&quot; I was
  really asking, what it does to your ability to see the world through the eyes of people
  who still have to struggle for a living. Is there a danger of being cut off from your best
  material?</b><br>
  A: Not at all. In fact, the good thing about <i>Sea of Love, </i>it gave me the cachet to
  have access to the world of Jersey City. This drug dealer who's in my book said to me,
  &quot;If God invented anything better than dope, he kept it to himself.&quot; <i>[Laughs] </i>When
  I heard that I thought, &quot;Yeah, that's pretty good.&quot; But then it occurred to
  me-there is one thing that's more powerful than dope, and that's movies. Because even
  people who don't like dope love movies. Everybody loves movies. All you've got to say <i>is,
  &quot;Sea of Love,&quot; </i>or <i>&quot;Color of Money,&quot; </i>and people look at you.
  They go weak in the knees. Like, &quot;Would you call him Al, or would you call him Mr.
  Pacino?&quot; All of a sudden you're like this bridge standing between them and this dream
  factory we all grew up on. And we're all dopey about. And you've actually been there. You
  know, it's like when you meet somebody who's actually been in combat in Vietnam. And you
  just get real quiet. And you look at the guy kind of differently. Everybody's conditioned
  in this society to be stunned by Hollywood, by the bigness of it. And that gave me access
  like you can't believe! If I say to them, &quot;Hey. I'm a writer,&quot; they're going to
  look at me strange. &quot;What the fuck do you mean, you're a writer?&quot; &quot;I mean I
  wrote <i>Sea of Love.&quot; &quot;You </i>wrote <i>Sea of Love?&quot; </i>&quot;YES. And
  now I'm interested in ... YOU.&quot; &quot;Yeah? No shit?? Well fuck, man. WHAT DO YOU
  WANT TO KNOW??? &quot; What I want is a ticket in-and by that I don't mean a ticket in to
  hang out with Felix Rohatyn or David Dinkins. I've never been interested in how it works
  at the top. I've always been interested in how it works at the bottom. That's not going to
  change because of all this money. And I spread around a lot of cash on <i>Clockers. </i>Anybody
  I could help, I did, though ironically the people who need money the most are the last to
  accept it-they don't want handouts. So I would find other ways to be helpful. I financed a
  barbecue for a whole housing project. My attitude was, &quot;You're doing so much for me,
  what can I do for you I've got my checkbook, I've got my mouth. How can I help?&quot;</font></p>

<u> (major spoilers for those who haven't seen it)</u></font></i></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#800000">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Sea of Love&quot; tells an ingeniously constructed
  story that depends for its suspense on the same question posed by &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;
  and &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;: What happens when you fall in love with a person who may
  be quite prepared to murder you? The movie stars Al Pacino, looking older and a little
  lined but more convincing than in most of his other recent roles as a homicide detective
  who is assigned to a messy murder case. The victim is a male who has been shot in his own
  bed, and the killer, it appears, was a woman. Tracking down leads, Pacino crosses paths
  with another detective (John Goodman) handling a similar case. They discover that both of
  their victims had placed rhyming ads in one of those singles magazines where people
  advertise for partners. Lacking any other clues, Pacino has a brainstorm: Why don't he and
  Goodman place an ad of their own, <strong><em><a
  href="pac_sol3.jpg"><img
  src="pac_sol3.jpg" width="130" height="150"
  align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a></em></strong>and then date all of the women who
  answer it? By getting the women's fingerprints on wine glasses, the cops may be able to
  discover the murderer. This notion leads to one of the movie's better sequences, as Pacino
  devotes half an hour apiece to assembly-line dates with a series of lonely hearts, while
  Goodman plays the waiter at his table. Then something unexpected happens. There is
  chemistry between Pacino and one of the women (Ellen Barkin), and although it is
  unprofessional and possibly dangerous, he sees her again and they find themselves
  powerfully attracted to one another. The movie uses this attraction to set a frankly
  manipulative plot into motion. Is Barkin, in fact, the killer? Various hints are dropped,
  various clues are planted. Pacino is meanwhile portrayed as so seriously disturbed within
  himself that he would almost prefer to die at this woman's hands than surrender his love.
  (The situation has an uncanny parallel with Glenn Close's feelings for Jeff Bridges in
  &quot;Jagged Edge.&quot;) The purely plot elements in &quot;Sea of Love&quot; work well
  enough until the very end of the movie, I suppose, when the solution turns out to be a red
  herring. But what impressed me most in the film was the personal chemistry between Pacino
  and Barkin. There can be little doubt, at this point, that Barkin is one of the most
  intense and passionately convincing actresses now at work in American movies. Her
  performance in &quot;The Big Easy&quot; (1987) was Oscar caliber, and again this time she
  seems to cross some kind of acting threshold. When she roughly embraces Pacino, and then
  stalks around the room like a tigress in heat before returning to her quarry, there is an
  energy that almost derails the movie. For Pacino, &quot;Sea of Love&quot; is a reminder of
  the strong presence he established in street roles in the 1970s, before he drifted away
  into an unfocused stardom in too many softer roles. This time he seems sharp, edgy,
  complicated and authentic. Goodman (who plays Roseanne Barr's husband on TV) makes a good
  partner for him, especially in the scenes where he stands by helplessly while his friend
  apparently chooses to be in love with a murderess. Movies like this need to work on two
  levels. The human elements should feel right, and the initial complications of the plot
  should not be shortchanged at the end. I think the ending of &quot;Sea of Love&quot;
  cheats by bringing in a character from left field at the last moment. Part of the fun in a
  movie like this is guessing the identity of the killer, and part of the problem with
  &quot;Sea of Love&quot; is that the audience is not fairly treated. Technically, I
  suppose, the plot can be justified. But I felt cheated. I had good feelings for the
  characters and their relationships, but I walked out feeling the plot played fast and
  loose with the rules of whodunits. </font></p>
