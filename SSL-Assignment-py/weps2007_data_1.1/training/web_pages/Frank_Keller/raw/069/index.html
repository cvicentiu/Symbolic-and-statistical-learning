            <h4>By Allan Burke</h4>

            <h4><i>Emmons County Record</i>, Linton, North Dakota, September 12, 
              1995, Pages 11 &amp; 12</h4>
            <font size="1"> 
            <hr>
            </font> 
            <p> Dr. Edward Keller, a Dickinson dentist and Emmons County native, 
              has written a book about his experiences growing up in the Rosenthal 
              community between Strasburg and Linton.
            <p>The 76-page book, &quot;My first World,&quot; chronicles the first 
              14 years of Dr. Keller's life and life in the community, from 1927-1941, 
              and focuses on the 28 families who lived in the seven-square mile 
              area west and south of Sacred Heart Church, the Rosenthal Parish. 
              The book is dedicated to the descendants of those families.</p>
            <p>Although he has not lived in Emmons County since 1941, Keller said, 
              &quot;I have never lost my love for the area and the people. I learned 
              so much that I have always used and still use today in my life.&quot;</p>
            <p>He explained, &quot;I love the `My First World' area and often 
              visit it. I love to walk on the land and drive through it. I can 
              feel the spirits of my forefathers whose bones rest there. I especially 
              love my farm home land. I remember every hill and valley, the large 
              unmovable rocks, the gopher and badger hole areas, the cactus patches, 
              pot holes, chokecherry and Juneberry groves and the rock <br>
              piles I played on at my farm.&quot;</p>
            <p>Keller said he wrote &quot;My First World&quot; after a family 
              history he prepared for his relatives was well received. &quot;I 
              decided to do a little bit about each of the 28 families I grew 
              up with,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p><b>Background</b></p>
            <p>Keller is the son of the late Frank and Helen (Schneider) Keller, 
              and he grew up on the farm now occupied by his brother and sister-in-law, 
              Debert and Alice (Welk) Keller. He had three sisters--Wilma, Mary 
              and Eleanor--and three brothers--Frank, Debert and Willie.</p>
            <p>His grandfather, Debertius Schneider, and his uncle, Louis Schneider, 
              were blacksmiths at Hague and forged many of the now famous iron 
              crosses found in German-Russian cemeteries in the area. The Schneiders 
              are noted in the N.D. Council on Arts book, &quot;Iron Spirits,&quot; 
              which is about the handmade markers.</p>
            <p>Keller attended Wells School No. 18 near the Wendelin Klein farm 
              for eight years and spent one year at Linton High School. He was 
              encouraged by Father Charles Meyer, who served the Rosenthal Parish, 
              to attend a Catholic school at the seminary in Canton, Ohio.</p>
            <p>Keller remembers that his father could not read or write. &quot;While 
              he served in the U.S. Army in World War I, his buddies read him 
              letters from my mother and wrote letters for him to her. A more 
              humbling experience I could not imagine,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
              listened to my mother read the Emmons County Record and a German 
              newspaper, The Dickinson Herald, to my father many times. At a restaurant, 
              a menu meant little to him. I remember him telling the waitress 
              that he wanted meat and potatoes. I read road signs for him along 
              the highway. This left an indelible impression on me. School became 
              important to me at a very early age. All of the people of `My First 
              World' held education in the highest esteem but had little means 
              to accomplish the task.&quot; He said he was fortunate to have the 
              priest take an interest in his education.</p>
            <p>He recalled, &quot;I moved nine hundred miles (to Ohio) and as 
              many cultures away from `My First World'.&quot;</p>
            <p>After high school, he served in the U.S. Army from 1946-49 as a 
              dental technician. He studied pre-dental at St. Thomas College in 
              St. Paul from 1949-51 and studied dentistry at Marquette Dental 
              School in Milwaukee, Wis., where he met his future wife, Shirley.</p>
            <p>&quot;One of my teachers at the seminary encouraged me to study 
              dentistry, and that encouragement combined with my work in the Army 
              charted my career,&quot; Dr. Keller explained.</p>
            <p>Like his parents, the Kellers have seven children. Edward, a graduate 
              of St. Thomas College in St. Paul, Minn., lives with wife Cathy 
              and son Loren in St. Paul. Ann Marie, a graduate of Moorhead State 
              University, lives in Mandan with her husband, Tim Simmons and their 
              two children, Nadeen and Weston. John, a graduate of St. Thomas 
              College and the University of Minnesota, resides with his wife Laurie 
              and children Megan, Ben and Brian in Anoka, Minn. Mary, a graduate 
              of Moorhead State University, lives with her husband Joe Torgerson 
              and their children Susan, Beth and Christina in Philomath, Ore. 
              Tom, a graduate of St. Thomas College, resides with his wife Renee 
              and son Austin in Plymouth, Minn. Joe, a graduate of St. Thomas 
              College, lives with his wife Dawn and children Gabriella and Georgia 
              in Plymouth, Minn. Paul, a graduate of the University of Minnesota, 
              lives in San Jose, Calif.</p>
            <p>Dr. Keller has been involved in the practice of dentistry for 40 
              years and practices by himself in Dickinson. Shirley is a Registered 
              Nurse in Home Health Care.</p>
            <p><b>The families</b></p>
            <p>Of the 28 farms in &quot;My First World&quot; only one changed 
              hands during Keller's years there. The farm nearest the Kellers' 
              was once owned by his grandfather, Mike Keller. The families who 
              lived on the farm during the 1930s were Peter and Magdalena Keller 
              (Dr. Keller's uncle) and their five children, Mike and Mary Ann 
              Vetter and their eight children and Frank and Mary Ann Jahner and 
              their seven children.</p>
            <p>Just south of the Keller farm was the Peter and Agnes Kraft place. 
              &quot;I saw this farm develop and then disappear. One day a house 
              appeared, then a barn along with some horses and cows and there 
              was a farm,&quot; Keller remembered. &quot;At my age then, I just 
              thought that farms always were. I had never given a thought to how 
              they were formed or discontinued.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Krafts and their two children moved after about five years, 
              and the house and barn were moved away.</p>
            <p>Teachers at the Wells school boarded at nearby farms. Keller's 
              first teacher, Miss Wells, stayed at the Wendelin and Bridget Klein 
              farm with the Kleins, and their five children. Two other teachers, 
              Rosina and Mary Eva Vetter, boarded with their brother's family, 
              Frank and Jenny Vetter, who had eight children.</p>
            <p>Keller said Wendelin stands out among the farmers in &quot;My First 
              World&quot; because he was &quot;bookish.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;He was known to read a book while driving a team of horses 
              during field work,&quot; Keller said.</p>
            <p>Another farmyard Keller passed through on his way to school was 
              that of Frank and Rosina Hagel, who had four children.</p>
            <p>&quot;The Hagels kept an eye out for me on stormy school days,&quot; 
              Keller said. &quot;One stormy morning the road, on the steep hill 
              after the bridge crossing, just past their house, was plugged with 
              four feet of snow. `Dave,' my horse, was in to his shoulders with 
              snow and the two-wheeled trailer was high-centered. Tony and John 
              Hagel shoveled snow and begged, coaxed and cheered Dave until finally 
              we got to the top and on to school.&quot;</p>
            <p>He said Frank went barefoot in the summer and would stand on a 
              piece of sheep fur on the iron header platform during harvest.</p>
            <p>John married Keller's sister, Wilma, and they raised nine children 
              on the Hagel farm.</p>
            <p>Just north of the school was the John Horner farm where John and 
              Barbara Horner raised 11 children. Keller said the granary on the 
              farm (the farm is now owned by John's grandson, John) was the site 
              of church fairs and was like a neighborhood hall. Bill Langer, the 
              fiery North Dakota governor and U.S. Representative, spoke there 
              a number of times. </p>
            <p>West of the &quot;Red Bridge&quot; northwest of the Rosenthal church 
              was the George and Philipena Bosch farm. He was one of five Bosch 
              brothers who settled along Beaver Creek. He was one five Bosch brothers 
              who settled along Beaver Creek. Keller said the Bosch brothers spoke 
              with a different German dialect and were nicknamed &quot;Crimmers&quot; 
              because they were from the Crimean area of Russia. Others in the 
              area were from Odessa, Russia, and were called &quot;Odessers,&quot; 
              he said.</p>
            <p>West on Beaver Creek was the Anton and Catherina Kelsch farm. They 
              had 10 children. Next came the John and Catherine Schiele farm, 
              where they raised five children.</p>
            <p>Next was the Anton and Christine Bosch farm, home to eight children. 
              West of Anton's was the Fred and Magdelina Bosch place where they 
              raised seven children.</p>
            <p>Andrew and Elizabeth Bosch and their nine children lived the farthest 
              west of all the Rosenthal parishioners. The fifth Bosch brother 
              was Ignatz. He and his wife, Margaret, and their 10 children lived 
              on Highway 13 just below a large hill. People referred to him as 
              &quot;Ignatz on the Hill,&quot; Keller remembered.</p>
            <p>Joe and Katie Hager and their six children lived on the Petrie 
              farm west of Andrew Bosch, and the farm stretched to Seeman Park 
              in Linton.</p>
            <p>Southeast of the Keller farm was the John and Frances Lauinger 
              place where they raised 10 children.</p>
            <p>The next farm south was the John and Magdalina Schwab farm, which 
              was home to 10 children. &quot;John was the most accomplished accordion 
              player around, and he had many students who would stay at his home 
              while he instructed them,&quot; Keller said. &quot;Lawrence Welk 
              was an accordion buddy of John Schwab's, and they enjoyed many a 
              `jam session' together.&quot;</p>
            <p>Keller said Schwab could play his accordion so loud that his music 
              at the Blue Room could be heard &quot;the minute you cross the tracks 
              into Strasburg.&quot;</p>
            <p>Northeast of the John Schwabs was the Igidi and Agatha Schwab farm, 
              home to 12 children.</p>
            <p>Buddy and Barbara Feist and their seven daughters lived near the 
              Schwab corner. Nearby was the Peter and Julie Kraft farm, home to 
              13 children. </p>
            <p>West of the Keller farm was the Adam and Magdalina Wolf farm where 
              they raised 11 children. Joe and Albert Wolf were gopher catching 
              buddies of Keller's.</p>
            <p>&quot;Adam sent many of his children to the Catholic school in 
              Strasburg because of his unusual interest in a good education,&quot; 
              Keller remembered. &quot;Adam once said that when he was younger 
              he thought you could never get to heaven unless you were a Democrat 
              and a Catholic. But as he got older he found that this was not true. 
              You didn't have to be Catholic. He also said that in all of the 
              Bible readings he never read that Jesus rode into town on an elephant.&quot; 
              Albert is now a prominent Bismarck attorney and active in politics.</p>
            <p>West of the Wolf place was the Steve and Eva Lipp farm, where they 
              had six children. The road to Highway 83 went past the Lipp farm, 
              and the road was a two-track trail in Keller's time.</p>
            <p>Next was the Peter and Catherine Lipp farm, home to eight children.</p>
            <p>South near the Strasburg road was the Wendelin and Barbara Wikenheiser 
              farm, home to seven children.</p>
            <p>Next was the Jack and Elizabeth Bauman farm, home to six children. 
              Jack was the son of Sebastian Bauman, one of the five original German-Russian 
              &quot;scouts&quot; who visited the area before people began to come 
              from Russia to Emmons County.</p>
            <p>The final farm south belonged to Carl and Catherine Keller, and 
              they raised 16 children in their large, two-story house.</p>
            <p><b>Much more</b></p>
            <p>&quot;My First World&quot; contains much information about life 
              in the 1920s and 30s, the Great Depression, rural schools, Germans 
              from Russia history and Emmons County history.</p>
            <p>Keller said he enjoyed writing the book. &quot;In knowing the history 
              of my ancestors, I can understand myself better in the present and 
              am more able to ponder the future,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>He said he has a &quot;bug to write&quot; and would like to do 
              a book about his years in dentistry. He enrolled in a journalism 
              course at Dickinson State University and would like to get into 
              writing short biographies for people.</p>
            <p>&quot;I get a high when I write, and write like I am writing to 
              somebody,&quot; Keller said. &quot;When I wrote my family's history, 
              I did it like I was writing to my grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&quot;</p>
