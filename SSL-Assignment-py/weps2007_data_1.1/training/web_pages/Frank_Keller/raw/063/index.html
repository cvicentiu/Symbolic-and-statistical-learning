<p>FRANK KELLER.  A good and substantial man, a patriotic citizen, a thrifty and industrious farmer, and one whose labors have been wisely bestowed for the development of this country, it is fitting that the subject of this article be accorded consideration in the history of the county of Nez Perces.
<p>Frank Keller was born in Tama county, Iowa, on October 3, 1866, being the son of Joseph and Sarah (Mericle) Keller, natives of Ohio. The father, born in 1844, was a pioneer to Iowa and now lives in Alabama, having wrought through life as a blacksmith. The mother's father, John Mericle, was a pioneer to Iowa. In 1881 the family removed to Cowley county, Kansas, where the father took land and there our subject grew to manhood and received the finishing part of his education in the common schools.  When twenty-one he stepped from the parental roof and inaugurated independent action.  He wrought at the stock business for four years and in 1891 sold out and came west to Elgin, Oregon.  For a time he farmed there and then made another move, this time to the county of Latah, and settled in the vicinity of Palouse, where he farmed for six years. It was in 1898 that he came to the reservation and selected a homestead four and one-half miles east from Melrose. He has opened up a farm and has a good orchard and in addition to general farming Mr. Keller raises cattle. He is prosperous and handles his business affairs with wisdom.
<p>In June, 1893, Mr. Keller married Miss Lona, daughter of Granville and Leona (White) Long, natives of Indiana, and the father a farmer.  Mrs. Keller was born in Indiana, in 1874, and has three brothers, Cornelius, Schuyler and Clyde.  Mr. Keller has the following brothers and sisters:  Martin, Jacob, Manuel, Joseph, Emma Kimball, and Pearl Sanderson. Two children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Keller, Esther and Clara.  Mr. Keller is a member of the M.W.A., at Melrose.  Mrs. Keller is a member of the Christian church. Mr. Keller is also a member of the school board and devotes time and attention to improving the school facilities.  He is a Democrat, but not bound by party ties, so that he feels at liberty to vote for the man he desires.
