              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Frank's interest 
                in railroading began at the age of 15 when when he bought the 
                November 1978 issue of Trains magazine in a Downey, California 
                hobby shop. Frank admits that he was completely hooked and soon 
                began spending his spare time </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
                hanging around the local railroad tracks waiting for trains.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Frank's interest 
                in the Rio Grande &quot;developed&quot; from a photography class 
                at Cerritos College where he met another person who liked trains. 
                Frank's new friend, today a lifelong friend, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">had 
                a deep rooted interest in the Rio Grande and it rubbed off. </font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Frank 
                and his friend planned their first railfan trip outside of California, 
                the Rio Grande was was a natural target and they decided to travel 
                to Denver to ride the Rio Grande Zephyr in March, 1983. This turned 
                out to be fortunate since roughly two weeks later, the Thistle 
                mudslide all but ended the the RGZ. Frank subsequently made dozens 
                of trips to Rio Grande country to photograph the railroad. Luckily, 
                Frank learned his lessons well in that photography class and he 
                has become a prolific and talented photographer of the Rio Grande 
                as well as other railroads. In 1994 his employer transferred him 
                to Colorado Springs and he was able to pursue his passion for 
                the Rio Grande more conveniently. </font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Frank owns 
                Primary Residential Mortgage Corporation in Colorado Springs. 
                He and his wife Kris have been married 15 years and have two daughters, 
                Hannah 6, and Ashley 10. While neither his wife nor his daughters 
                share his enthusiasm for the Rio Grande, they are very tolerant 
                of his interests.</font> </p>
