He is a, brother of Joseph and Frank Keller, Sr., and was the youngest son of
George and Barbara (Dorsch) Keller. He attended the Parochial School in his
native village, and after receiving a practical education, was employed at
common labor.  June 3rd. 1853, he in company with several acquaintances from
his home, left Bremen for the United States. They arrived in New York on August
1st, and immediately started for Buffalo, their place of destination being
Sandusky. Mr. Keller, however, came to Upper Sandusky, making this his
permanent place of residence.  He obtained employment on train "A," doing
construction work on the Pennsylvania Railroad.  Four years later he received
a promotion to section manager. September, 1861, he enlisted in the Fifty-fifth
Ohio Volunteer Infantry, under Captain Robbins. His company served at times
under Generals McClelland and Pope. The company left for the seat of war by
way of Wheeling, West Virginia.  He got his first war experience in skirmishes
at Culpepper Station, and Mannasas Junction, participated in the battle of
"Bull Run," in which battle his company lost in killed and wounded twenty-two.
Shortly after he was taken sick, remaining at the hospital four months; not
properly regaining his former good health, he received an honorable discharge
and returned to Upper Sandusky. He is an honored member of Robbins Post, Grand
Army of the Republic, and only lately received a pension, though in poor
health ever since serving in the army.<BR><P>
