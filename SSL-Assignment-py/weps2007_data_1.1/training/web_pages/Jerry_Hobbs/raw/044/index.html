Natural language understanding in general is a very hard problem,
because of the high degree of ambiguity in language and the large
amount of world knowledge required for understanding it.  However, in
the last few years significant progress has been in made in one
application -- information extraction.  The who, what, where, and when
of specific types of events of interest can be recognized and
extracted from texts with a moderate degree of accuracy, and entered 
into a structured database.

<p>
In this talk I will review this technology, especially with regard to
SRI's FASTUS system.  It works essentially as a cascaded,
nondeterministic finite-state automaton.  There are five stages in the
operation of FASTUS.  In Stage 1, names and other fixed form
expressions are recognized.  In Stage 2, basic noun groups, verb
groups, and prepositions and some other particles are recognized.  In
Stage 3, certain complex noun groups and verb groups are constructed.
Clause-level patterns for events of interest are identified in Stage 4
and corresponding ``event structures'' are built.  In Stage 5,
distinct event structures that describe the same event are identified
and merged, and these are used in generating database entries.  This
decomposition of language processing enables the system to do exactly
the right amount of domain-independent syntax, so that
domain-dependent semantic and pragmatic processing can be applied to
the right larger-scale structures.  FASTUS is very efficient and
effective, and has been used successfully in a number of applications.

<p>
In addition, I will discuss current and future research directions,
focusing especially on greater ease of use by naive users, easier
acquisition of new domains, and extension to other media besides text.
