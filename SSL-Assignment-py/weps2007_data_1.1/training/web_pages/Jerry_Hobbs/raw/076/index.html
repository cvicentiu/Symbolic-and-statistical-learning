TEMECULA<p>
 Jerry Hobbs said he resigned from the Temecula Valley school board, in part, because other trustees would not consider switching from trimesters to semesters in high schools.<p>
 Hobbs said Superintendent David Allmen, apparently on the instructions of new board President Rick Shafer, rebuffed his attempt to put the issue on the school board's agenda.<p>
 Hobbs announced his resignation from the Temecula Valley Unified School District board Tuesday. On Wednesday he said had anticipated stepping down before the end of his term in November 2001, because of work and family considerations.<p>
 However, he said his decision to resign sooner was cemented by what he characterized as the board's refusal to confront an important yet controversial educational issue.<p>
 &quot;I don't have the time, the energy or the patience to be on a board that is unwilling to tackle such a serious problem,&quot; he said.<p>
 Shafer disagreed with Hobbs' characterization. The board is interested in discussing the trimester system, but raising the issue Tuesday may have sent the wrong signal during difficult teacher-contract negotiations, Shafer said.<p>
 &quot;He had a valid issue and we were going to discuss it,&quot; Shafer said. &quot;It was just the timing.<p>
 &quot;Jerry has always been used to his timing, not someone else's timing,&quot; Shafer said.<p>
 Hobbs said that while Temecula elementary students rank in the top third of a national sample on standardized tests, high school students are roughly average. Part of the problem appears to be a trimester system in high school that gives students more choices in elective classes at the expense of core academic subjects, Hobbs said.<p>
 Hobbs, a former Temecula Valley High School teacher, also said counselors spend so much time coordinating students' schedules under the trimester system that they have less time for academic counseling.<p>
 Meanwhile, two other trustees said Wednesday that the high cost of holding a special election likely will prompt the board to appoint Hobbs' successor.<p>
 A special election to replace Hobbs would cost about $100,000, roughly twice that of a regular election, according to district officials.<p>
 &quot;I don't think there would be any support to hold a special election,&quot; said Trustee Barbara Tooker. &quot;It is too expensive and we can't share that expense with another agency.&quot;<p>
 While Tooker and trustee Ed Elder disagree on the term of the appointment, both said the appointed person must help mend fences, not revive past disputes that factionalized the previous board.<p>
 &quot;I think we have all seen the destructive nature of animosity,&quot; Tooker said. &quot;I would personally not want to fill the position with someone who would be hostile to a team approach.&quot;<p>
 She said the board should appoint someone for the rest of Hobbs' term. Elder prefers appointing someone until November 2000, when a regular election that would cost about $50,000 could be held to pick someone to serve the final year of Hobbs' term.<p>
 Trustees are expected to review the laws that govern filling a board vacancy when they meet at 8 a.m. Saturday at the district office. Tooker said she does not expect the board to decide then whether to appoint a new trustee or schedule an election. Trustees have 60 days to name Hobbs' successor or schedule an election.<p>
 Two residents said Wednesday they would apply for Hobbs' seat if it is filled by appointment and a third said he might.<p>
 Douglas Blois, who finished fifth out of six candidates in the Nov. 2 election, said he would apply. Rodolfo &quot;Rudy&quot; Martinez, who dropped out of that campaign but still received nearly 8 percent of the votes, said he would run again and may apply if one or more trustees encourage him to do so.<p>
 Kenneth Ray, who has been active in school issues, said he would apply and there are probably several other interested residents.<p>
 &quot;At this point,&quot; it's wide open,&quot; Ray said.<p>
