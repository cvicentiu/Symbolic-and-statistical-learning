<h2> A General Theory of Parallelism and the Special Case of VP
Ellipsis </h2>
<h3>Jerry R. Hobbs, SRI International, Menlo Park CA</h3>
</center>
<p>

I will provide a general account of parallelism in discourse, and
apply it to the special case of resolving possible readings for
instances of VP ellipsis, showing how several problematic examples are
accounted for in a natural and straightforward fashion in this
framework.  By combining this with accounts of other, interacting
phenomena, a greater range of cases is handled than in previous
approaches.  The generality of the approach makes it directly
applicable to a variety of other types of ellipsis and reference in
discourse.  This is a joint work with Andrew Kehler.
