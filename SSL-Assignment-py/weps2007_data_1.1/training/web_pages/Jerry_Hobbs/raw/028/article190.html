<b>Jerry Hobbs; A Good Example Of Why We Have A Death Penalty</b>
<br><br></center>

<i>By Wayne Adkins</i>
<br>May 14, 2005
<br><br>
Jerry Hobbs is a perfect example of why there is
a death penalty and why there always should be. Here
is a man who has admitted to the brutal beating and
stabbing to death of his own daughter and her best
friend on Mother&#8217;s Day. He had previously served time
for assault and had once chased his neighbors with a
chainsaw. Jerry Hobbs deserves to die.<br><br>
     There are those who would say that the death
penalty is just vengeance killing; a murder for a
murder. They would argue that to take any life
devalues human life. I would argue that not avenging
the heinous deaths of two second grade girls would
devalue their lives. Jerry Hobbs let us all know how
much value he places on a human life, even the life of
his own daughter. Is there any reason why society
should place a higher value on his life than he placed
on his victims lives? Hobbs has allegedly told police
that he was enraged because his daughter had taken
forty dollars from her mother&#8217;s purse. He gave his own
daughter and her best friend the death penalty for
petty theft.  He made a decision about what life is
worth when he hacked those two children to death and
we should hold him to that decision. If alleged petty
theft warrants death in his mind, then double murder
should warrant no less.<br><br>
     I&#8217;ll go a step further. As soon as he enters a
guilty plea he should be executed within the week. The
families of those victims should not have to work
every day and pay taxes to house, feed, educate and
provide medical care and legal representation for
their daughter&#8217;s killer. I shouldn&#8217;t either. In fact,
there should be far fewer life in prison sentences and
a lot more death penalty recipients. When a person
does something like this and admits it to police and
pleads guilty to it in a court of law they should die
immediately. It&#8217;s a simple matter of expedience at
that point. We already know this person will die in
prison. It&#8217;s just a matter of whether we get it over
with or drag it out for decades while tax payers bear
the burden and other criminals, perhaps some like
Jerry Hobbs, are released because we don&#8217;t have the
space or resources to keep them in jail for their
entire sentences. Let&#8217;s free up some of that space and
resources. Let&#8217;s find our collective backbone and give
those criminals what they have coming to them. And
most of all, let&#8217;s give the victims and their families
the justice they have coming to them. <br><br>
     Our system of justice is not perfect. But it is
not in the trial or sentencing phases that the biggest
problem resides. It is in the punishment phase that
our system falls apart. The death penalty is just
that, a penalty. Allowing condemned men to live out
their natural lives means that they have not paid the
penalty they were sentenced to. We all die eventually.
The death penalty means nothing if we keep the guilty
on death row until they die of natural causes.
Granted, death row is not a pleasant place to spend
ones life, but I&#8217;m sure it beats being stabbed to
death when you&#8217;re in the second grade.
