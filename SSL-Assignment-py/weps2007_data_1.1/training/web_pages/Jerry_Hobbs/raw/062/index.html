<p><h2> PROJECT SUMMARY </h2>

The long-range project goal is to create a unified architecture for
interactive discourse, incorporating both interpretation and
generation.  The immediate goal is to develop an environment for
simulating and testing dialog in cooperative planning environments.

The project focuses on four theoretical problems: (1) the recognition
by the hearer of the speaker's plan; (2) a formalization of the
notion of the "conversational record"; (3) a computational treatment
of discourse structure; and (4) the analysis of quantity implicatures
and other phenomena that crucially involve interactions between the
processes of generation and interpretation.  At the same time, the
project is developing an environment for tracking coordination in
human task-oriented discourse.  Using abductive reasoning as a
framework, we are extending this environment to develop a discourse
simulator for the domain.

The basis of our approach to interpretation is the abductive model of
Jerry Hobbs and his associates at SRI.  The basis of our approach to
generation is the plan-based approach of Johanna Moore.  Ideas about
the conversational record are based on work of Robert Stalnaker, David
Lewis, Herbert Clark, and Richmond Thomason.

<h2>
AREA BACKGROUND
</h2>

	Rather than working in the context of an established
framework, we are trying to develop a combination of theoretical
ideas and empirical methods for the study of discourse which will
inform the design and testing of interactive systems based on 
natural language.  

	Some leading ideas are: (1) The importance of combining
simulation techniques with corpus analysis in testing hypotheses
about discourse; (2) an architecture that provides thorough
integration of the representations and reasoning used in
interpretation and generation; (3) the use of the conversational
record to record the common information that is established in 
the course of a discourse.
