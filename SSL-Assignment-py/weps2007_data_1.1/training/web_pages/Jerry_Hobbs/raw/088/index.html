				<div id="Print1_divStory" class="gtv_body">WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- The man accused of stabbing to death his 8-year-old daughter and her best friend hunted his child down in a park in a fit of rage because she was supposed to be grounded for stealing money, prosecutors said Wednesday.<br><br>A judge denied bail for 34-year-old ex-convict Jerry Hobbs after prosecutors said he admitted in videotaped and written statements to beating and stabbing his daughter Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old<br>Krystal Tobias on Mother's Day.<br><br>He claimed the older girl pulled a knife on him, but prosecutors said they doubt that.<br><br>The girls were found dead Monday in a park in Zion, the day after they never came back from a bike ride. They had more than 30 stab wounds between them, and Laura was stabbed in each eye,<br>prosecutors said.<br><br>"You can see through the injuries to these two individuals the rage that was exhibited. This was a slaughter of two little girls," prosecutor Jeff Pavletic said.<br><br>Hobbs, who had been released from a Texas prison last month, said he thought Laura had stolen money from her mother, prosecutors said. She was supposed to be grounded on Mother's Day, but her<br>mother let her go out and play, so Hobbs went out to find her and bring her home, Pavletic said.<br><br>"Mr. Hobbs believed that her mother was too lax in her supervision of Laura," the prosecutor said.<br><br>But when Hobbs found the girls, Laura refused to go home, and he beat and stabbed the girls with a small kitchen knife, prosecutors said. Hobbs then allegedly dragged them into the woods and left<br>them side-by-side.<br><br>Hobbs told investigators that Krystal pulled the knife to defend her friend, and he wrested it away. But prosecutors said they doubt the little girl was carrying a blade.<br><br>"It was a brutal beating, repeated punching of the two little girls and then repeated stabs. It's pretty horrible," State's Attorney Michael Waller said.<br><br>Public Defender David Brodsky said he had not seen details of the case and had no comment, but he said he would assign two capital defenders to represent Hobbs.<br><br>Hobbs has a long criminal history dating to 1990 in Texas, including arrests for assault and resisting arrest.<br><br>Just last month, he was released from a Texas prison after serving time for an assault in 2001. He had argued with Laura's mother, Sheila Hollabaugh, then grabbed a chain saw and chased<br>neighbors until someone hit him in the back with a shovel, according to prosecutor Rick Mahler in Texas. No one was injured.<br><br>Hobbs was sentenced to 10 years' probation but failed to appear for required meetings and was thrown in prison in 2003.<br><br>Outside the home where Jerry Hobbs and Sheila Hollabaugh had lived with their children, a man who identified himself as a family spokesman Wednesday read a brief statement and said they would have no other comment.  "The entire family wants to express their deepest sympathy for<br>the Tobias family," Jeremy Harter said. "They wanted to thank the Zion community for all their support throughout this trying time."<br><br>Zion, along Lake Michigan, was founded in 1901 by a faith healer. It has about 22,000 residents but retains a quiet -- at times, rural -- feel despite being on the edge of both the Chicago<br>and Milwaukee metropolitan areas.</div>
