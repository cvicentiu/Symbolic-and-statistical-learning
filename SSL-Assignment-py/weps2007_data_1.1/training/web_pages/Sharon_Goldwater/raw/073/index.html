          BOYS' LIFE is presented by arrangement with Dramatists Play Service, 
          Inc. in New York.<br>
          <br>
          BOYS' LIFE was presented by Lincoln Center Theater at the Mitzi E. Newhouse

          DIRECTOR'S NOTE<br>
          <br>
&quot;Name three things that happened in the Eighties. You have one 
          minute.&quot;<br>
          <br>
&quot;Let's see. . .Ronald Reagan . . . and . . . and . . . and . . 
          . the Soviet Union?<br>
          <br>
          . was that still the Eighties? . . . and . . . and . . .did I say Ronald 
          Reagan?&quot;<br>
          <br>
&quot;Give up?&quot;<br>
          <br>
&quot;That wasn't a minute!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          The Eighties. Can it be possible that a play set in the late Eighties 
          is already a period piece? Howard Korder's caustic comedy would seem 
          to support that theory. Things are moving so fast, as we catapult toward 
          the new millennium, that even a decade ago feels like a quarter century, 
          at least.<br>
          Here are some of the remarkable things the Boys' Life cast has realized 
          about the ancient world of the Eighties: There were no cell phones to 
          speak of. Almost no one had a CD player yet. The answering machine which 
          you could access from afar was a relative novelty. Very few people had 
          a personal computer. No home shopping on the cable. No voice mail. No 
          surfing the net. As one person put it, &quot;Who knew from dot com?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          And remember the clothes in the Eighties? Big-shouldered power suits? 
          Dangerous looking leather? Heavy metal sequined dresses? Jewel-tone 
          colors? Eighties fashion was a clear reflection of the almost universal 
          lust for money and power. The yuppies were working out at the gym, and 
          their clothes were designed to reveal--or, if necessary, to create the 
          illusion of--a powerful V-shaped body. The huge shoulder pads in women's 
          workaday clothing were designed to send the message that the wearer 
          was no one to be pushed around. High heels were still regulation office 
          wear, but there was a revolution in the making: for the first time women 
          were seen on the streets of America's cities, walking to work in that 
          incongruous combination of &quot;full corporate battle gear&quot; and 
          Reeboks.<br>
          <br>
          Gender roles were being radically redefined with battalions of women 
          entering the corporate world. But as they scrambled up the rungs of 
          the corporate ladder, home and family seemed to drag them back by the 
          ankles. Professional women found that &quot;having it all&quot; usually 
          meant having two full-time jobs: one in the office, the other in the 
          kitchen. Yet, for the first time, a few couples in the vanguard were 
          reversing the traditional roles of husband and wife: he was the one 
          at home with the kids; she was bringing home the bacon. But at what 
          cost?<br>
          <br>
          The battle of the sexes was heating up to a fever pitch. Sure, it was 
          still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, but the rules 
          of combat were changing. And the worst part was that in this war, there 
          seemed to be no victors. Sometimes it was even hard to tell the villains 
          from the good guys, the war criminals from their innocent victims.<br>
          <br>
          It is on this ever-shifting battlefield that Howard Korder set his comedy 
          of sexual insecurity, which a reviewer for The New Yorker called &quot;the 
          most balanced and intelligent comment on the battle of the sexes I've 
          seen in a long time&#133;&quot;. Like all good comedy, Boys' Life is 
          both funny and sad. As our all-too-human foibles are exposed and ridiculed, 
          we find ourselves laughing one minute and mourning the next. And, if 
          all goes well, we leave the theatre gladder but wiser. --Lowry Marshall<br>

            DIRECTOR'S NOTE<br>
            <br>
            A Yoruba proverb states that &quot;The White man who made the pencil 
            also made the eraser.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            How does one recapture an erased history?<br>
            <br>
            In the library of St. Genevieve in the Latin Quarter of Paris, there 
            is a simple unsigned portrait of an African woman in nun's habit: 
            Louise Marie Therese, the Black Nun of Moret (1664-1732). Cloistered 
            all her life, this African-featured nun took the veil at the late 
            age of 31 in 1695. Journals and diaries attest to her having been 
            visited throughout her life by important personages from the royal 
            Court. A folder at St. Genevieve bears the title, &quot;Documents 
            Concerning The Princess Louise Marie, Daughter of Louis XIV and Marie 
            Theresa.&quot; The folder is empty.<br>
            <br>
            On November 1664, after a pregnancy marked by &quot;dark forebodings,&quot; 
            Maria Theresa, the pious and devoted Queen of the notoriously philandering 
            Louis XIV, gave birth to a baby daughter. Laughter is said to have 
            greeted her birth. Rumors ran wild in the court. The child was said 
            to have been born &quot;black as ink from head to toe,&quot; covered 
            with hair, a monster. Shortly after birth, the child was pronounced 
            dead by a grief-stricken King.<br>
            It was rumored at Court that the child was fathered by an African 
            dwarf named Nabo, a young man from Dahomey presented to the Queen 
            by relatives in Spain. Soon after his arrival, Nabo had become the 
            Queen's favorite companion. Perhaps, it was discretely suggested, 
            a penetrating glance from this slave had corrupted the royal womb. 
            Nabo was sent for by the King. He disappeared.<br>
            Joseph Roach, in his recent Cities of the Dead: Circum-Atlantic Performance, 
            (Routledge 1996), suggests that such disappearances are frequent in 
            the annals of European history. The following lines are cobbled together 
            with apologies from various chapters of his book, representing one 
            of the several through lines of thought in an elegant argument.<br>
            <br>
            Memory is a process that depends crucially on forgetting. [There are] 
            persistent Atlantic occasion[s] particularly subject to forgetting: 
            encounters between and among white, red, and black peoples. In representations 
            of such encounters, at least one of the parties seems fated to disappear 
            from the selective memory of another. On the one hand, forgetting 
            is an opportunistic tactic of whiteness. Such disappearances are necessary 
            to ensure the untroubled performance of a dominant trope: that of 
            genealogical succession, imagined as a stately procession, as an everlasting 
            club whose members succeed one another as if on parade. On the other, 
            the vast scope of the project of whiteness?and the scope of the contacts 
            amongst cultures that it required?limited the degree to which its 
            foils could be eradicated from the memory of those who had the deepest 
            motivation and the surest means to forget them. In a world continuously 
            reinvented by intercultural propinquity?and that is precisely what 
            the circum-Atlantic world was and is?the order of any procession may 
            be threatened with interruption or usurpation. There is a pressure 
            exerted by this implicit menace of usurpation. The fear that blood 
            will be mixed, a fear that intensifies the ritual expectation that 
            blood must be shed, haunts these representations like a vengeful ghost: 
            the specter of future generations threatening to be born.<br>
            <br>
            How does one recapture a history erased in &quot;the project of whiteness&quot;? 
            One way is by refiguring it as fiction, in the subjunctive, as fantasy 
            and play?piecing together bits and pieces of dialogue noted in journals 
            and diaries, restaging encounters noted but not described, and letting 
            imagination, humor, and rage flood into the spaces left empty by the 
            human shredding machines of history's spin doctors.<br>
            <br>
            And why name a play about events that may have taken place in a French 
            Court after a Spanish masterpiece painted by someone who never even 
            visited France? Perhaps, because Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, too, was 
            concerned with the backstage to history, with what is revealed, what 
            is hidden, and what gets seen in a distorted mirror. Perhaps, because 
            Maria Theresa and Louise Marie?close kin of the Spanish royal family 
            being prepared for history in Las Meninas (which has sometimes been 
            translated as The Ladies in Waiting)?are themselves ladies in waiting: 
            each waiting for love, for personal narrative, for her story to be 
            lived and performed.<br>

            this fall. It is an honor and a pleasure to present the world premiere 
            of Las Meninas. On Tuesday, October 2nd, while this production was 
            in rehearsal, Lynn and her husband, Tony Gerber (also Brown 1987) 
            brought their own daughter into the world: Ruby Gerber. The production 
            is dedicated to her. -- JE<br>

            DIRECTOR'S NOTE<br>
            <br>
            To travel to the other side of imagination, to find a magical world 
            existing beyond the knowledge of the everyday, is a trend running 
            through the hopes of childhood - searching for that which has been 
            called impossible.<br>
            <br>
            To deal with the world at hand, find a creative solution, and remember 
            the mystical illusion in all that is beyond belief, is so uncommon 
            to adulthood - no longer taking the time to imagine that which is 
            deemed impossible.<br>
            <br>
            Every journey results in accumulation. We are so accustomed to this 
            build-up of both objects and ideas that there is no pattern to which 
            we can turn to get rid of our candy wrappers and our leftover beliefs.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps, as adults, we no longer closely examine what someone once 
            told us was impossible. Is the solution that we need to be found only 
            if we look inside of ourselves, inside of each other, inside of a 
            cactus? -- Eric Green and Nancy Johnston</b></font></p>

            Choreographer's Note:<br>
&quot;THE ORACLE&quot; deals with man's quest to understand the paradox 
            of life and death, our fear and attraction to sexuality and our communion 
            with the unknown power that drives us. It was inspired by the oracle 
            at Delphi in Greece, a cave where deities were consulted.<br>
            (Lyrics by Tiye Giraud)<br>
            I am the caller<br>
            I have always been there<br>
            Asking the same questions<br>
            Giving the very same answers<br>

  DIRECTOR&#146;S NOTE<br>
            <br>
            Theatre is a collaborative process, and the production of a full-scale 
            musical of the magnitude of Sweeney Todd demonstrates that truism 
            to the maximum. In this collaboration we have been blessed with talented 
            actors/singers, musicians, scenic and costume artists, technicians, 
            and all of the other positions necessary to make this performance 
            a reality. And perhaps most significantly, this effort has been possible 
            because of the equal support of the Departments of Music and Theatre, 
            Speech and Dance. All of us are indebted to the unflagging support 
            of our chairs, Nancy Dunbar (Theatre) and Gerald Shapiro (Music). 
            We were also extraordinarily fortunate to have as part of our team 
            the phenomenal designer Eugene Lee, not only a local theatre treasure 
            (he has been Resident Designer at Trinity Rep for 30 years and is 
            now a visiting member of the Brown theatre faculty) but a national 
            and international presence with designs for the recent revival of 
            Show Boat and the current Ragtime (see display in the lobby), as well 
            as landmark productions of Candide and, of course, the original Sweeney 
            Todd, among many other credits. It was great fun giving Eugene another 
            go at Todd on a stage so dramatically different from that of Broadway&#146;s 
            Uris Theatre (now the Gershwin). Thanks Eugene!<br>
            <br>
            Now a note on Sweeney Todd. The original story, dating back to 14th 
            century French legends, became part of British lore via early 19th 
            century British ballads. Despite popular belief, there is no evidence 
            that there ever was a real Sweeney. In 1847 George Dibdin Pitt turned 
            the story of a murderous barber and his meat-pie baker neighbor into 
            a popular melodrama, which in turn was based on a horror story (&#147;The 
            String of Pearls&#148;) by Thomas Peckett Prest published the year 
            before in The People&#146;s Periodical, a &#147;penny dreadful&#148;. 
            At least seven other theatrical versions of the tale have been seen 
            in England since Pitt&#146;s first text.<br>
            <br>
            Among twentieth-century treatments of the tale the best know are William 
            Latimer&#146;s 1900 play, a 1936 British film, and a ballet choreographed 
            in 1959 by John Crank. In most instances, versions after 1973 chose 
            to make fun of the exaggerated horror and romance. British playwright 
            Christopher Bond, however, chose in 1973 to return the story to its 
            original, serious intent, making Sweeney an ordinary man whose happiness 
            has been destroyed by a corrupt social order, rather than simply a 
            greedy murderer. It was this version that inspired Stephen Sondheim 
            to adapt the work for the musical stage in collaboration with director 
            Harold Prince and librettist Hugh Wheeler.<br>
            <br>
            The original production won eight Tony awards. A simplified 1989 revival 
            Off Broadway was especially notable for its focus on the dark heart 
            of the text. Sweeney Todd is now a staple for opera companies around 
            the world, and its reputation has risen to that of an acknowledged 
            classic. And, I might add, an extraordinary challenge for an academic 
            theatre to produce. --DBW <br>
            <br>
            MUSICAL DIRECTOR&#146;S NOTE<br>
            <br>
            As a student in New York, I had the very good fortune to see Sweeney 
            Todd on Broadway a few days after it opened at the Uris Theatre on 
            March 1, 1979. The intensity of the story, the grandeur of the stage 
            production, and above all, the beauty and power of the music had a 
            tremendous impact upon me. I recall walking 60 blocks uptown back 
            to my upper West Side apartment afterwards in a kind of daze, dazzled 
            by Stephen Sondheim&#146;s brilliant score. Now, almost exactly 19 
            years later, it is a long-awaited pleasure to help bring this great 
            work to the stage here at Brown.<br>
            <br>
            With masterly concision, the music of Sweeney Todd precisely conveys 
            the nature of each of the main characters - Anthony&#146;s optimism 
            and confidence, Sweeney&#146;s darkly cynical world view, Mrs. Lovett&#146;s 
            gossipy chatterbox personality, and so on - but it does far more than 
            this. The use and recurrence of musical motifs adds a richness to 
            the musical language that one usually associates with opera rather 
            than Broadway musicals. In this &#147;musical thriller&#148;, as Sondheim 
            called it, the music even more than the words provides the &#147;clues&#148; that reveal the plot, so listen carefully!<br>
            <br>
            The score, deftly orchestrated by longtime Sondheim associate Jonathan 
            Tunick, resonates with the many musical styles from which Sondheim 
            has drawn - English music hall (&#147;Pirelli&#146;s Miracle Elixir&#148;, 
            &#147;God, That&#146;s Good!&#148;, &#147;By The Sea&#148;), English 
            folk ballad (&#147;Parlor Songs&#148;), Italian verismo opera (&#147;The 
            Contest&#148;), and Strauss waltz (&#147;A Little Priest&#148;) - 
            not to mention Richard Wagner, Bernard Herrmann, and Igor Stravinsky. 
            The most seminal musical motif in the score is taken from the ancient 
            Dies irae (&#147;day of wrath&#148;) plainchant from the Requiem mass 
            for the dead. As Stephen Banfield has shown in his authoritative study 
            of Sondheim&#146;s musical language, it forms the core of &#147;The 
            Ballad of Sweeney Todd&#148; and is present virtually throughout the 
            score.<br>
            I wish to acknowledge the tremendous contribution of stage director 
            Don Wilmeth, set designer Eugene Lee, and everyone in the Department 
            of Music and the Department of Theatre, Speech and Dance who has played 
            a part in this production, and to thank all of the marvelously talented 
            students in the cast who have made working on this production such 
            a joy. Finally, I especially want to thank those wonderful students 
            in the Brown University Orchestra who have lent their time and talent 
            so generously to this production. --Paul Phillips <br>

            THE ORACLE<br>
            Choreography by Anita Gonzalez<br>
            Music by Tiye Giraud<br>
            DANCERS:<br>
            THE SATYR James Brown<br>
            WOMEN Jessica Gaynor, Alison Harris, Brandeis Johnson, Leta Malloy, 
            Daryl Springer, Jessica Zenk, Michelle Bach-Coulibaly<br>
            Choreographer's Note:<br>
&quot;THE ORACLE&quot; deals with man's quest to understand the paradox 
            of life and death, our fear and attraction to sexuality and our communion 
            with the unknown power that drives us. It was inspired by the oracle 
            at Delphi in Greece, a cave where deities were consulted.<br>
            (Lyrics by Tiye Giraud)<br>
            I am the caller<br>
            I have always been there<br>
            Asking the same questions<br>
            Giving the very same answers<br>
