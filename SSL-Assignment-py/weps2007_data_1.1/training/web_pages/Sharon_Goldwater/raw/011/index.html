<h2>	<A NAME="software">Software</a> </h2>

Some of my statistical parsers are available for research use.
Please look at the Brown Computer Science Homepage, under Software
Catalog, and then under <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.brown.edu/pub/nlparser/">
nlparser</a>.
Unfortunately I cannot really
support them, so I will almost certainly not
respond to e-mails for help unless the problem looks particularly interesting.
<p>
To inspire research into parsing, I thought it might be interesting
to publicize a list of sentences on which my parser performs
poorly.  <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/ec/papers/badPars.txt.gz">Look here.</a>

<h2> <A NAME="biography">Biographical Material</a></h2>

<p>

Eugene Charniak is Professor of <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu"> Computer
Science</a>.  
and Cognitive Science
at Brown University.
He received an A.B. degree in Physics from University of
Chicago and a Ph.D. from M.I.T. in Computer Science.  He has
published four books: <cite>Computational Semantics</cite>, with
Yorick Wilks (1976); <cite>Artificial Intelligence Programming</cite>
(now in a second edition) with Chris Riesbeck, Drew McDermott, and
James Meehan (1980, 1987); <cite>Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence</cite> with Drew McDermott (1985); and <cite>Statistical
Language Learning</cite> (1993).  He is a Fellow of the American
Association of Artificial Intelligence and was previously a Councilor
of the organization.  His research has always been in the area of
language understanding or technologies which relate to it, such as
knowledge representation, reasoning under uncertainty, and learning.
Over the last few years he has been interested in statistical
techniques for language understanding.  His research in this area has
included work in the subareas of part-of-speech tagging,
probabilistic context-free grammar induction, and, more recently,
syntactic disambiguation through word statistics, efficient syntactic
parsing, and lexical resource acquisition through statistical means.
