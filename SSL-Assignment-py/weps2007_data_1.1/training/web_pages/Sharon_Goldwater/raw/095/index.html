                             Call for Papers 

                             HLT-NAACL 2006 

                           Eighth Meeting of the 
                        ACL Special Interest Group 
                        in Computational Phonology 

                          New York City, NY, USA 
                              June 8, 2006 


Workshop Description and Motivation 
----------------------------------- 
Eighth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational
Phonology 

The workshop will be devoted to all areas of computation, as applied 
to contemporary phonology and morphology. Papers will be on 
substantial, original, and unpublished research on any aspect of 
computational phonology and computational morphology. 

Preference will be given to high-quality papers which address the role 
of computational morphology and phonology in NLP.  In particular, we 
looking for work which shows how (or if) morphology and phonology are 
useful in larger problems such as machine translation, speech 
recognition, OCR, or sentence-level parsing. 

Other topics include, but are not limited to, those listed below, 
focusing on recent developments since our last meeting at ACL 
(Barcelona) in 2004. 

* Speech technologies relating to phonology 
* Unsupervised learning of phonotactics, morphology, and phonology 
* Stochastic or probabilistic phonology 
* Computational evolutionary modeling of phonological systems 
* Language-independent learning algorithms relating to computational
* phonology 
* Finite-state formalizations of phonology 
* Computational morphology and morphological modeling 
* Speech generation 
* Assistive learning tools for second language speakers 

One of the missions of SIGPHON is to encourage interaction between 
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonology, 
in the hope that both fields profit from the interaction.  In 
addition, SIGPHON continues to promote work in computational 
morphology, seeking to fill in for the absence of an analogous 
SIGMORPH group.  Our recent meetings have been successful in both 
regards, and we hope to see this continue in 2006.  Many mainstream 
phonologists are employing computational tools and models that are of 
considerable interest to computational linguists more generally, and 
our intention is that this workshop should be a forum to bring this 
work to the attention of a wider range of computational linguists. 

This workshop will be the eighth meeting of SIGPHON, the ACL Special 
Interest Group in Computational Phonology. We will hold a full-day 
workshop consisting of approximately 12 half-hour presentations plus 
an invited speaker. 

The principal goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in 
the area of computational phonology. Computational phonology is an 
important and recognized subfield of computational linguistics, but
has 
received little attention at recent ACL meetings. We expect the
workshop 
to facilitate interactions among computational phonologists who are 
attending ACL, and to attract more attendance by computational 
phonologists. 

The workshop will be held on June 8, immediately after the HLT-NAACL 
2006 meetings in New York City.

Organizers and Program Committee 
-------------------------------- 

SIGPHON has sponsored seven previous workshops, most recently 
co-located with ACL in Barcelona is 2004, and including Philadelphia 
(ACL) in 2002, Luxembourg (COLING) in 2000, and Montreal (ACL) in 
1998. 

The members of the SIGPHON Executive Committee have a wide range of 
research experience, covering not only computational phonology and 
morphology, but also related areas such as phonological field work, 
phonetics, statistics, psycholinguistics, and engineering. They are: 

Paul Boersma, University of Amsterdam (paul dot boersma at uva dot nl) 
Julie Carson-Berndsen, University College Dublin
(julie dot berndsen at ucd dot ie) 
John Coleman, University of Oxford (john dot coleman at phon dot ox dot ac dot uk) 
Jason Eisner, The Johns Hopkins University (jason at cs dot jhu dot edu) 
John Goldsmith, University of Chicago (ja-goldsmith at uchicago dot edu) 
Richard Wicentowski, Swarthmore College (richardw at cs dot swarthmore dot edu) 

The organizers will be Richard Wicentowski and Grzegorz Kondrak 
(kondrak at cs dot ualberta dot ca). 

The Executive Committee will appoint a program committee that will be 
responsible for selection of the papers. The program chair may invite 
additional reviewers as necessary to obtain relevant expertise and 
avoid conflicts of interest. 

The program committee will consist of all members of the executive 
plus, and the following individuals: 

Adam Albright, University of California at Santa Cruz 
Anja Belz, University of Brighton 
Steven Bird, University of Melbourne 
Mathias Creutz, Helsinki University of Technology 
Sharon Goldwater, Brown University 
Lauri Karttunen, Palo Alto Research Center 
Mike Maxwell, Linguistic Data Consortium 
Kemal Oflazer, Sabanci University 
Gerald Penn, University of Toronto 
Vito Pirrelli, I. di Linguistica Computazionale 
Richard Sproat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 

Important Dates 
--------------- 
* Submission Deadline: March 2, 2006 
* Notification: April 3, 2006 
* Camera-ready Copy Due: April 21, 2006 
* Workshop: June 8, 2006 


Paper Submission 
---------------- 
Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work 
is preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should
clearly 
indicate the state of completion of the reported results. 

Dual Submission: Papers which are submitted to the ACL 2006 general 
conference may not be also submitted to SIGPHON 2006. 

Length: Submissions should be full-length papers, up to a maximum of 8 
pages. (The final version in the proceedings should incorporate 
reviewers' suggestions and may be up to 10 pages.) High-quality short 
papers of 4 to 5 pages will also be considered. 

Layout: Except for length, papers must conform to HLT-NAACL 2006 
formatting guidelines, available at <a  href="http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/hlt-naacl06/">http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/hlt-naacl06/</a> 

Electronic Submission: All submissions will be electronic. Reviews 
will be blind, so be careful not to disclose authorship or 
affiliation. PDF submissions are preferred over PostScript 
submissions and will be required for the final camera-ready copy. 
Submissions should be sent as an attachment to 
sigphon06 at cs dot swarthmore dot edu dot  Please be sure to include accurate 
contact information in the body of the email.
