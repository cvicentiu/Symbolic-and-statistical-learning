href="http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~c.walshaw/abc/">Chris Walshaw's 
site</a>: ""abc" is a language designed to notate tunes in an ascii 
format. It was designed primarily for folk and traditional tunes of 
Western European origin (such as Irish, English and Scottish) which 
can be written on one stave in standard classical notation. However, 
it is extendible to many other types of music. Since its introduction 
at the end of 1991 it has become very popular and there now exist 
several PC and UNIX based tools which can read abc notation and 
either process it into staff notation or play it through the speakers 
of a computer." Chamber's collection includes <a
