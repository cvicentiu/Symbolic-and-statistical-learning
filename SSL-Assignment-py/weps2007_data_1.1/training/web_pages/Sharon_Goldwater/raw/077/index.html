Parsing with Treebank Grammars: Empirical Bounds,
Theoretical Models, and the Structure of the Penn Treebank.
Dan Klein and Christopher Manning.
Available at: <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/exhaustive-parsing.ps">http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/exhaustive-parsing.ps</a>

This paper presents empirical studies and closely corresponding
theoretical models of the performance of a chart parser exhaustively
parsing the Penn Treebank, using the Treebank's own CFG grammar.  We
show how parser perfomance is dramatically affected by rule
representation choices, and analyze the value of top-down vs. bottom-up
strategies.  We discuss grammatical saturation, including analysis of
the strongly connected components of the phrasal nonterminals in the
Treebank, and present evidence that as sentence length increases, the
effective grammar size increases as regions of the grammar are 
unlocked,
yielding super-cubic observed time behavior in some configurations.

Presentation by Tolga Ilhan

In this paper, we present and compare various single-word based alignment 
models for statistical machine translation. We discuss the five IBM 
alignment models, the Hidden-Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques 
and various modifications. We present different methods to combine 
alignments. As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting 
Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We 
show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model lead 
to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, 
which are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies.

We present a system for identifying 
the semantic relationships, or semantic 
roles, filled by constituents of a sentence 
within a semantic frame. Various lexical 
and syntactic features are derived from 
parse trees and used to derive statistical 
classifiers from hand­annotated training

Abstract: STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a language independent system for 
automatic discovery of text in parallel translation on the World Wide Web. 
This paper extends the preliminary STRAND results by adding automatic 
language identification, scaling up by orders of magnitude, and formally 
evaluating performance. The most recent end-product is an automatically 
acquired parallel corpus comprising 2491 English-French document pairs, 
approximately 1.5 million words per language.

Chris Callison-Burch, Raymond S. Flournoy. A Program for Automatically
Selecting the Best Output from Multiple Machine Translation Engines 
Presentation by Chris Callison-Burch.

<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/AmikaiMT.rtf">http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/AmikaiMT.rtf</a>

This paper describes a program that automatically selects the best
translation from a set of translations produced by multiple
commercial machine translation engines.  The program is simplified
by assuming that the most fluent item in the set is the best
translation.  Fluency is determined using a trigram language
model.  Results are provided illustrating how well the program
performs for human ranked data as compared to each of its
constituent engines.

J. Dowding, B.A. Hockey, M.J. Gawron,

for Speech Recognition". To be presented at ACL 2001.
Presentation by John Dowding.
Available at: <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/jdowding.pdf">http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/jdowding.pdf</a>

Current alternatives for language modeling are statistical
techniques based on large amounts of training
data, and hand-crafted context-free or finite-state grammars that
are difficult to build and maintain. One way to address the problems
of the grammar-based approach is to compile recognition grammars from
grammars written in a more expressive formalism.   While theoretically
straight-forward, the compilation process can exceed memory and time
bounds, and might not always result in accurate and efficient speech
recognition. We will describe and evaluate two approaches to this
compilation problem.  We will also describe and evaluate additional
techniques to reduce the structural ambiguity of the language model.

Including Biological Literature Improves Homology Search
by Jeffrey T. Chang, Soumya Raychaudhuri, and Russ B. Altman. 
Presented by Jeff Chang.
Annotating the tremendous amount of sequence information being generated
requires accurate automated methods for recognizing homology.  Although
sequence similarity is only one of many indicators of evolutionary
homology, it is often the only one used.  Here we find that supplementing
sequence similarity with information from biomedical literature is
successful in increasing the accuracy of homology search results.  We
modified the PSI-BLAST algorithm to use literature similarity in each
iteration of its database search.  The modified algorithm is evaluated and
compared to standard PSI-BLAST in searching for homologous proteins.  The
performance of the modified algorithm achieved 32% recall with 95%
precision, while the original one achieved 33% recall with 84% precision;
the literature similarity requirement preserved the sensitive
characteristic of the PSI-BLAST algorithm while improving the precision.

presentation by David Bree This paper presents a method for extracting

frequently used to convey temporal information and so a solution to its
semantics will be a good guide to the semantics of other propsitions
that are used temporally.  The method takes the form of a set of rules
and heuristics.  It is derived from an analysis of a one-million word
corpus of English texts.

Abstract:  We explain the dialogue modelling and management techniques
used in a multi-modal interface for conversations with autonomous agents.
This setting presents important challenges for dialogue system engineers.
We describe some general problems, and their solution in a conversational
interface to a robot helicopter (or UAV). Its main innovation is a
dialogue manager which implements a dynamic information state model of
dialogue."

Annotating the CallHome Japanese speech corpus.
John Fry, Stanford Linguistics Dept.

The CallHome Japanese (CHJ) corpus consists of transcripts and
digitized speech data for 120 spontaneous telephone conversations
between native speakers of Japanese (LDC 1996).  The CHJ corpus was
originally collected for research on large-vocabulary speech
recognition.  For the last two years, however, my colleagues and I
have been annotating the CHJ transcripts with lexical, prosodic, and
semantic information in order to make the corpus a useful resource for
other areas of linguistic research such as ellipsis, topicalization,
and speaker disfluencies.  Our annotations include: (i) the
pronunciation and POS of each word in the corpus; (ii) acoustic and
prosodic data like duration, fundamental frequency, and energy; (iii)
the semantic properties (e.g., human, inanimate, etc.) of 46,000
nouns; and (iv) verb senses and basic predicate-argument structure for
24,000 verbs.  Some of these annotations could be generated
automatically, while others relied the judgments of native speakers.
After describing how the annotations were (or in some cases, are still
being) carried out, I will discuss potential research applications for
the annotated corpus.

Cosmin Popovici and Paolo Baggia: Language Modelling for Task-Oriented
Domains.  Proceedings of EUROSPEECH'97, Rhodes, Greece, vol. 3, pp. 1459-1462

This paper is focused on the language modelling for task-oriented
domains and presents an accurate analysis of the utterances acquired by
the Dialogos spoken dialogue system. Dialogos allows access to the
Italian Railways timetable by using the telephone over the public
network. The language modelling aspects of specificity and behaviour to
rare events are studied. A technique for getting a language model more
robust, based on sentences generated by grammars, is
presented. Experimental results show the benefit of the proposed
technique. The increment of performance between language models created
using grammars and usual ones, is higher when the amount of training
material is limited. Therefore this technique can give an advantage
especially for the development of language models in a new domain.

Challenges in Adapting an Interlingua for Bidirectional
English-Italian Translation.  Proceedings of AMTA 2000.
Violetta Cavalli-Sforza (San Francisco State University)
Krzysztof Czuba, Teruko Mitamura, Eric Nyberg  
(Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University).
Paper presented by Violetta Cavalli-Sforza.

We describe our experience in adapting an existing high-quality,
interlingual, unidirectional machine translation system to a new
domain and bidirectional translation for a new language pair (English
and Italian). We focus on the interlingua design changes which were
necessary to achieve high quality output in view of the language
mismatches between English and Italian. The representation we propose
contains features that are interpreted differently, depending on the
translation direction. This decision simplified the process of
creating the interlingua for individual sentences, and allows the
system to defer mapping of language-specific features (such as tense
and aspect), which are realized when the target syntactic feature
structure is created. We also describe a set of problems we
encountered in translating modal verbs, and discuss the representation
of modality in our interlingua.
