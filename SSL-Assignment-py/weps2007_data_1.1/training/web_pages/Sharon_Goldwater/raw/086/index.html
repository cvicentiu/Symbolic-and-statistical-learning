<BR>Workshop Description and Motivation
<BR>-----------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>Eighth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology
<BR>
<BR>The workshop will be devoted to all areas of computation, as applied
<BR>to contemporary phonology and morphology. Papers will be on
<BR>substantial, original, and unpublished research on any aspect of
<BR>computational phonology and computational morphology.
<BR>
<BR>Preference will be given to high-quality papers which address the role
<BR>of computational morphology and phonology in NLP.  In particular, we
<BR>are looking for work which shows how (or if) morphology and phonology
<BR>are useful in larger problems such as machine translation, speech
<BR>recognition, OCR, or sentence-level parsing.
<BR>
<BR>Other topics include, but are not limited to, those listed below,
<BR>focusing on recent developments since our last meeting at ACL
<BR>(Barcelona) in 2004.
<BR>
<BR>* Speech technologies relating to phonology
<BR>* Unsupervised learning of phonotactics, morphology, and phonology
<BR>* Stochastic or probabilistic phonology
<BR>* Computational evolutionary modeling of phonological systems
<BR>* Language-independent learning algorithms relating to computational phonology
<BR>* Finite-state formalizations of phonology
<BR>* Computational morphology and morphological modeling
<BR>* Speech generation
<BR>* Assistive learning tools for second language speakers
<BR>
<BR>One of the missions of SIGPHON is to encourage interaction between
<BR>work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonology,
<BR>in the hope that both fields profit from the interaction.  In
<BR>addition, SIGPHON continues to promote work in computational
<BR>morphology, seeking to fill in for the absence of an analogous
<BR>SIGMORPH group.  Our recent meetings have been successful in both
<BR>regards, and we hope to see this continue in 2006.  Many mainstream
<BR>phonologists are employing computational tools and models that are of
<BR>considerable interest to computational linguists more generally, and
<BR>our intention is that this workshop should be a forum to bring this
<BR>work to the attention of a wider range of computational linguists.
<BR>
<BR>This workshop will be the eighth meeting of SIGPHON, the ACL Special
<BR>Interest Group in Computational Phonology. We will hold a full-day
<BR>workshop consisting of approximately 12 half-hour presentations plus
<BR>an invited speaker.
<BR>
<BR>The principal goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in
<BR>the area of computational phonology. Computational phonology is an
<BR>important and recognized subfield of computational linguistics, but has
<BR>received little attention at recent ACL meetings. We expect the workshop
<BR>to facilitate interactions among computational phonologists who are
<BR>attending ACL, and to attract more attendance by computational
<BR>phonologists.
<BR>
<BR>The workshop will be held on June 8, immediately after the HLT-NAACL
<BR>2006 meetings in New York City.

<BR>Organizers and Program Committee
<BR>--------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>SIGPHON has sponsored seven previous workshops, most recently
<BR>co-located with ACL in Barcelona is 2004, and including Philadelphia
<BR>(ACL) in 2002, Luxembourg (COLING) in 2000, and Montreal (ACL) in
<BR>1998.
<BR>
<BR>The members of the SIGPHON Executive Committee have a wide range of
<BR>research experience, covering not only computational phonology and
<BR>morphology, but also related areas such as phonological field work,
<BR>phonetics, statistics, psycholinguistics, and engineering. They are:
<BR>
<BR>Paul Boersma, University of Amsterdam (paul.boersma_AT_uva.nl)
<BR>Julie Carson-Berndsen, University College Dublin (julie.berndsen_AT_ucd.ie)
<BR>John Coleman, University of Oxford (john.coleman_AT_phon.ox.ac.uk)
<BR>Jason Eisner, The Johns Hopkins University (jason_AT_cs.jhu.edu)
<BR>John Goldsmith, University of Chicago (ja-goldsmith_AT_uchicago.edu)
<BR>Richard Wicentowski, Swarthmore College (richardw_AT_cs.swarthmore.edu)
<BR>
<BR>The organizers will be Richard Wicentowski and Grzegorz Kondrak
<BR>(kondrak_AT_cs.ualberta.ca).
<BR>
<BR>The Executive Committee will appoint a program committee that will be
<BR>responsible for selection of the papers. The program chair may invite
<BR>additional reviewers as necessary to obtain relevant expertise and
<BR>avoid conflicts of interest.
<BR>
<BR>The program committee will consist of all members of the executive
<BR>plus, and the following individuals:
<BR>
<BR>Adam Albright, University of California at Santa Cruz
<BR>Anja Belz, University of Brighton
<BR>Steven Bird, University of Melbourne
<BR>Mathias Creutz, Helsinki University of Technology
<BR>Sharon Goldwater, Brown University
<BR>Lauri Karttunen, Palo Alto Research Center
<BR>Mike Maxwell, Linguistic Data Consortium
<BR>Kemal Oflazer, Sabanci University
<BR>Gerald Penn, University of Toronto
<BR>Vito Pirrelli, I. di Linguistica Computazionale
<BR>Richard Sproat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
<BR>
<BR>Important Dates
<BR>---------------
<BR>
<BR>* **Extended** Submission Deadline: March 20, 2006
<BR>* Notification: April 3, 2006
<BR>* Camera-ready Copy Due: April 21, 2006
<BR>* Workshop: June 8, 2006
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Paper Submission
<BR>----------------
<BR>
<BR>Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work
<BR>is preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should clearly
<BR>indicate the state of completion of the reported results.
<BR>
<BR>Dual Submission: Papers which are submitted to the ACL 2006 general
<BR>conference may not be also submitted to SIGPHON 2006.
<BR>
<BR>Length: Submissions should be full-length papers, up to a maximum of 8
<BR>pages. (The final version in the proceedings should incorporate
<BR>reviewers' suggestions and may be up to 10 pages.) High-quality short
<BR>papers of 4 to 5 pages will also be considered.
<BR>
<BR>Layout: Except for length, papers must conform to HLT-NAACL 2006
<BR>formatting guidelines, available at <A HREF="http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/hlt-naacl06/">http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/hlt-naacl06/</A>
<BR>
<BR>Electronic Submission: All submissions will be electronic. Reviews
<BR>will be blind, so be careful not to disclose authorship or
<BR>affiliation. PDF submissions are preferred over PostScript
<BR>submissions and will be required for the final camera-ready copy.
<BR>Submissions should be sent as an attachment to
<BR>sigphon06_AT_cs.swarthmore.edu. Please be sure to include accurate
<BR>contact information in the body of the email.
