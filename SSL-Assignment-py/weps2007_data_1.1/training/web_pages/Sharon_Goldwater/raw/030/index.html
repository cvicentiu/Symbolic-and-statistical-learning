    <center><h1>My Model of the CIT</h1></center>

    <p> Below are two pictures; one is the real Center for Information
      Technology, the other is
      my model. See if you can tell which is which! (OK, so the
      reflection of me taking the picture gives it away.) I also have
      some
      <a href="http://www.sgwater.org/citPics.html">more pictures</a> and a
      <a href="http://www.sgwater.org/citInfo.html">description</a>
      of the model and its construction. You can visit my model in person on the 4th
      floor of the real CIT-- I donated the model to the Brown CS
      Department upon graduation.
