<h3 align=center>Current Life</h3>

<p>I work in the Spoken Language Systems group of the
<img align=right src="plum2.gif" alt="plum">
<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/">Artificial Intelligence Center</a> at
<a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI International</a>, a
research, development, and consulting organization based in Menlo
Park, CA. I'm working on a computer dialog system called Gemini,
adding robustness so it can deal with out-of-grammar utterances.

<h3 align=center>Previous Life</h3>

<p>
<img align=left src="apple2.gif" alt="apple">
I grew up in
<a href="http://www.westmass.com/towns/amherst.html">Amherst,</a>
MA, and graduated
from
<a href="http://www.arhs.net/">Amherst Regional High School</a> in 1994. My older brother,
<a href="http://fatmac.ee.cornell.edu/~goldwada/">Dan,</a>
is just one of many other fascinating 
<a href="http://k12s.phast.umass.edu/~arhs/alumni/">alumni.</a>
I attended
<a href="http://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> 
in Providence, RI, and graduated in May '98 with an Sc.B. in
<a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/">mathematics</a>-
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/">computer science</a>
and a strong interest in
<a href="http://www.cog.brown.edu/">linguistics</a>.
You can take a look at my

there, at least until my account disappears.

<h3 align=center>Projects and Papers</h3>

<p>
<img align=right src="cherries2.gif" alt="cherries">
<ul>
<li> My lego robots, <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/robots.html">Pico and ChiaPet</a>. I made
them in Fall '96 for my Building Intelligent Robots class.
<li> A paper on <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/quantum.html">quantum cryptography</a>, written
as part a group independent study on cryptography.
<li> An introduction to <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/math/knots/">knots and surfaces</a>. This
was my final project for Combinatorial Topology, Fall '96.
<li> An investigation into the <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/math/curves/">intersection of curves</a>. Another project from topology, parts of which I presented at the
Hudson River Undergraduate Math Conference.
<li> A <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/cit.html">model of the CIT</a>. My final project for
Contemporary Architecture, it now resides on the 4th floor of the real CIT.
<li> <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/wvlc98.ps">"Edge-Based Best-First Chart Parsing."</a>
(PostScript format). With
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/ec/">Eugene Charniak</a> and
<a href="http://www.cog.brown.edu/~mj/">Mark Johnson</a>.
Presented at the sixth Workshop on Very Large Corpora (following
COLING-ACL '98).
<li> My <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/Thesis.ps">senior thesis</a>, by the same name
(PostScript format). It describes the same research as the above paper,
but with more background information. Aimed at the general CS audience
rather than statistical natural language researchers.
<img align=left src="orange3.gif" alt="orange">
<li> A paper about <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/OCR.ps">Optical Character Recognition</a>
(PostScript format). With
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/seh/">Sam Hazlehurst</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/ajm/">Andy Miller</a>. It was
the final project for our Machine Learning class, and we could have
used a little more time...

<h3 align=center>Summer Log</h3>

<p>
<img align=right src="kiwi1.gif" alt="kiwi">
I spent the summer of 1997 at Brown doing research in the computer science
department, dealing with the trials and tribulations of my new
apartment, and hanging out with my friends. If you're interested, you
can take a peek at the blow-by-blow of
