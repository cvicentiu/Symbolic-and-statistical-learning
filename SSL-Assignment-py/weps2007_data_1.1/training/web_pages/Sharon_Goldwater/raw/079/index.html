  &quot;Anonymization Techniques for Published Data&quot;</p>
<p>Many organizations publish and distribute non-aggregate personal data for purposes including medical, demographic, and public health research.  For legal and ethical reasons, it is important that these organizations take steps to protect the identities of individuals, as well as their sensitive personal information. At the same time, concern for privacy must be balanced with the need to provide useful, high-quality data.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will first give a brief overview of the anonymity problem in data publishing.  Then I will describe a new multidimensional generalization approach (also commonly called &quot;recoding&quot;) and greedy algorithmic framework.</p>
<p>The contributions of this work span two key dimensions: First, there are a seemingly infinite number of ways to measure data quality.  I will take a very direct evaluation approach, based on a target workload of queries and data mining tasks, and I will describe some ways to directly incorporate knowledge of a workload into the anonymization process.  Second, as more and more personal information is collected, it is important to develop algorithms that are both efficient and scalable.  In the latter part of the talk, I will describe techniques for incorporating scalability into our algorithmic framework.</p>

  &quot;Improving the Performance of Highly Reliable Software  Systems&quot;</p>
<p>Commodity operating systems still retain the design principles developed when processor cycles were scarce and RAM was precious. These out-dated principles have led to performance/functionality trade-offs that are no longer needed or required; I have found that, far from impeding performance, features such as safety, consistency and energy-efficiency can often be added while improving performance over existing systems.</p>
<p>I will describe my work developing Speculator, which provides facilities within the operating system kernel to track and propagate causal dependencies.  Using Speculator, I will show that distributed and local file systems can provide strong consistency and safety guarantees without the poor performance these guarantees usually entail.</p>

<p>&quot;Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks as a Knowledge Representation Paradigm and Interlingua for Meaning Representation&quot;</p>
<p>The talk gives an overview of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (abbreviated MultiNet), which is one of the most comprehensively described knowledge representation paradigms used as a semantic interlingua in large-scale NLP applications and for linguistic investigations into the semantics and pragmatics of natural language.</p>
<p>As with other semantic networks, concepts are represented in MultiNet by nodes, and relations between concepts are represented as arcs between these nodes. Additionally to that, every node is classified according to a predefined conceptual ontology forming a hierarchy of sorts, and the nodes are embedded in a multidimensional space of layer attributes and their values.</p>
<p>MultiNet provides a set of about 150 standardized relations and functions which are described in a very concise way including an axiomatic apparatus, where the axioms are classified according to predefined types. The representational means of MultiNet claim to fulfill the criteria of universality, homogeneity, and cognitive adequacy. In the talk, it is also shown, how MultiNet can be used for the semantic representation of different semantic phenomena.</p>
<p>To overcome the quantitative barrier in building large knowledge bases and semantically oriented computational lexica, MultiNet is associated with a set of tools including a semantic interpreter NatLink for automatically translating natural language expressions into MultiNet networks, a workbench LIA for the computer lexicographer, and a workbench MWR for the knowledge engineer for managing and graphically manipulating semantic networks.</p>
<p>The applications of MultiNet as a semantic interlingua range from natural language interfaces to the Internet and to dedicated databases, over question-answering systems, to systems for automatic knowledge acquisition.</p>

&quot;Virtualizable Architecture for High Performance Network  Stack&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  The Networking stack in Solaris 10 uses a new architecture for doing network processing where the NIC is controlled by the network and the transport layers creating a per CPU vertical perimeter. The network stack is able to schedule the receive-side packet processing by dynamically controlling the rate of packet arrival from individual receive rings on the NIC. The architecture minimizes context switches and allows processing of packets without losing CPU affinity or contending for any locks.</p>
<p>The network processing for a connection is performed from a vertical perimeter, which is implemented by a serialization queue and consists of one or more threads bound to a CPU for better locality.</p>
<p>There is, at most, one queuing, and a packet once picked up for processing is processed all the way to the socket layer on the inbound case, and all the way to the NIC on the outbound case without needing to contend for additional locks or switch context.</p>
<p>The stack also provides the building blocks for network virtualization and resource control by creating virtual stacks around any service (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, NFS, etc.), protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP, etc.), or Virtual machines like Containers or Xen.</p>
<p>Each virtual stack can be assigned its own priority and band-width on a shared NIC without causing any performance degradation.  The architecture dynamically manages priority and bandwidth resources, and can provide better defense against denial-of-service attacks directed at a particular service or virtual machine by isolating the impact just to that entity. The virtual stacks are separated by means of H/W classification engine such that traffic for one stack does not impact other virtual stacks.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;The Computational Problem of Natural Language Acquisition&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>The talk reviews work-in-progress on language acquisition in children and robots using combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), building on work by Siskind, Villavicencio, and Zettlemoyer, among others.</p>
<p>CCG is a theory of grammar in which all language-specific grammatical information resides in the lexicon. A small universal set of strictly type-driven, non-structure dependent, syntactic rules (based on Curry's combinators B, S, and T) then &quot;projects&quot; lexical items into sentence-meaning pairs. The task that faces the child in the earliest stages of language acquisition can therefore be seen as learning a lexicon on the basis of exposure to (probably ambiguous, possibly somewhat noisy) sentence-meaning pairs, given this universal combinatory &quot;projection principle&quot;, and a mapping from semantic types to the set of all universally available lexical syntactic types.</p>
<p>The talk argues that a very simple statistical model allows children to arrive at a target lexicon without navigation of subset principles, or attention to any attendant notion of trigger other than the notion &quot;reasonably short sentence in a reasonably understandable situation&quot;. The model explains the pattern of errors that have been found in elicitation experiments. The linguistic notion of &quot;parameter&quot; appears to be redundant to this process.</p>
<p>The talk goes on to consider some more general implications of the theory, including its application to the phenomenon of &quot;syntactic bootstrapping,&quot; touching on the question of the prelinguistic origin of the combinatory projection principle itself.</p>

  &quot;Analyzing Properties of Systems&quot;</p>
<p>As the complexity of and the dependence on engineered systems rises, correctness becomes ever more important. Verification aims to prove or to disprove that a system's implementation meets its specification. A specification asserts a set of properties that should hold on all executions of the system. Two areas of research are fundamental to verification: invariant generation and decision procedures. In this talk, I describe progress in both.</p>
<p>I first present a strategy for letting properties guide an invariant generation procedure, a form of static analysis. I then exhibit two instances of the strategy. The first augments generation of affine inequality invariants to be property-directed. For the second instance, I introduce a procedure for generating clausal invariants of finite-state systems such as hardware circuits and show how to make it property-directed.</p>
<p>Arrays are ubiquitous data structures in software and in hardware specifications. I present a decision procedure for a fragment of a theory of arrays that allows some quantification. Besides being expressive, this fragment is interesting because it lies on the edge of decidability: natural and simple extensions produce undecidable fragments.</p>
<p>Finally, I briefly discuss my work with Zohar Manna on developing a new undergraduate course at Stanford. Our course and accompanying forthcoming text, both entitled &quot;The Calculus of Computation&quot;, cover first-order logic; decision procedures; and software specification, verification, and analysis.</p>

  &quot;Democratizing Content Distribution&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  In order to reach their large audiences, today's Internet publishers primarily use content distribution networks (CDNs) to deliver content. Yet the architectures of the prevalent commercial systems are tightly bound to centralized control, static deployments, and trusted infrastructure, thus inherently limiting their scope to ensure cost recovery.</p>
<p>This talk describes a number of techniques (and the resulting systems) that realize highly-scalable cooperative content distribution. I show how to build a fully self-organizing CDN that efficiently delivers content using unreliable nodes, describe how to transparently dispatch clients to nearby servers, and touch on how to securely incentivize resource sharing.</p>
<p>These ideas have been implemented, deployed, and tested in production systems currently serving several terabytes of data to more than a million people every day. The view of the Internet gained from deploying these systems answered long-standing questions about network configuration, while providing important insights that helped evolve our systems'  designs.</p>

  &quot;Core Fusion: Accommodating Software Diversity in Chip Multiprocessors&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) hold the prospect of delivering long-term performance growth by integrating more cores on the die with each new technology generation. In the short term, on-chip integration of a few relatively large cores may yield sufficient throughput when running multiprogrammed workloads. However, harnessing the full potential of CMPs in the long term makes a broad adoption of parallel programming inevitable.</p>
<p>We envision a CMP-dominated future where a diverse landscape of software in different stages of parallelization exists at all times.  Unfortunately, in this future, the inherent rigidity in current proposals for CMP designs makes it hard to come up with a &quot;universal&quot; CMP that can accommodate this software diversity.</p>
<p>In this talk I will discuss Core Fusion, a CMP architecture where cores can &quot;fuse&quot; into larger cores on demand to execute sequential code very fast, while still retaining the ability to operate independently to run highly parallel code efficiently. Core Fusion builds upon a substrate of fundamentally independent cores and conventional memory coherence/ consistency support, and enables the CMP to dynamically morph into different configurations to adapt to the changing needs of software at run-time. Core Fusion does not require specialized software support, it leverages mature micro-architecture technology, and it can interface with the application through small extensions encapsulated in ordinary parallelization libraries, macros, or directives.</p>

&quot;S^3: A Scalable Sensing Service for Monitoring Large Networked Systems&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Efficient operation of large-scale distributed systems such as enterprise networks, grid systems, and sensor networks is a grand challenge. One of the crucial reasons is the lack of current and accurate knowledge of the global state of the individual components in the system including both network and individual machine attributes. Most commercial network management systems monitor only a subset of system metrics and also at a relatively coarse grain timescales to be able to collect and process the measurements at a central location. This impedes decision making at very fine timescales, which is important for several emerging applications like interactive multi-media services and early-anomaly detection systems. We provide a Scalable Sensing Service (S^3) that the network management subsystem as well as individual applications/services can subscribe to and securely get customized information at very fine timescales suitable for their purposes. For scalable operation, S^3 provides the sensing service in a decentralized manner, eliminates unnecessary duplicate measurements by consolidating sensing requirements of different applications, and provides inference engines to estimate network metrics with high accuracy while avoiding quadratic all-pair measurements load. S^3 can be used for a number of management tasks such as failure or anomalous behavior detection, resource location and placement, and network route setup for optimal performance.</p>

  &quot;Can We Teach Computers to Write Fast Libraries?&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  As the computing world goes multicore, high performance library development finally becomes a nightmare. Optimal programs, and their underlying algorithms, have to be adapted to take full advantage of the platforms parallelism, memory hierarchy, and available instruction set. To make things worse, the best implementations are often platform-dependent and platforms are constantly evolving, which quickly renders libraries obsolete. As a consequence, developers are forced to permanently re-implement and re-optimize the same functionality and often even revert to assembly coding just as 50 years ago.</p>
<p>A number of research efforts have started to address this problem in a new area called Automatic Performance Tuning with the common goal to rethink the way libraries are created. In this talk we present Spiral (www.spiral.net), a program generation system for linear transforms. Spiral generates highly optimized, platform-tuned implementations of transforms directly from a problem specification. For a user-specified transform, Spiral generates alternative algorithms, optimizes them, compiles them into programs, and intelligently searches for the best match to the computing platform. The main idea behind Spiral is a mathematical, declarative framework to represent algorithms and the use of rewriting systems to generate and optimize algorithms at a high level of abstraction. Optimization includes parallelization for vector architectures, shared and distributed memory platforms, GPUs, and even FPGAs. Experimental results show that the code generated by Spiral competes with, and sometimes outperforms, the best av.<br>

&quot;Algorithm Engineering&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  I will introduce some of the techniques and optimizations developed/used for two examples: All-Pair Shortest Path (APSP) and Strassen Matrix multiplication (SMM). These techniques improve the performance, the code portability and  the code maintainability ( e.g.,; they simplify the code) and they open new opportunities for aggressive compiler optimizations.</p>
<p>I show that these two examples (APSP and SMM) build on top of highly tuned routines such as GotoBLAS and ATLAS enhancing their application range and performance.  Also, I will address issues such as algorithm correctness and numerical stability for APSP and SMM.</p>

<p align="center">Talk Title:  &quot;Improved Algorithms for Path, Matching, and Packing  Problems&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Improved randomized and deterministic algorithms are presented for well-known NP-hard Path, Matching, and Packing problems. Our randomized algorithms are based on the divide-and-conquer technique, and improve previous best algorithms for these problems. For example, for the k-Path problem, our randomized algorithm runs in time $O(4^k k^{2.7}m)$ and space $O(nk\log k + m)$, improving the previous best randomized algorithm for the problem that runs in time $O(5.44^kkm)$ and space $O n (2^k k n + m)$. To achieve improved deterministic algorithms, we study a number of previously proposed derandomization schemes, and show how they can be improved and effectively used to achieve efficient deterministic algorithms. This study results in the following deterministic algorithms: one of time $O(4^{k+o(k)}m)$ for the k-Path problem, one of time $O(2.80^{3k} k n \log^2 n)$ for the 3-D matching problem, and one of time $O(3.2^{3k}n)$ for the 3-Set Packing problem. All these significantly improve previous best deterministic algorithms for the problems.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Even though Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) is well-understood (the Inside-Outside algorithm can do this efficiently from the terminal strings alone) the inferred grammars are usually linguistically inaccurate. In order to better understand why maximum likelihood finds poor grammars, this talk examines two simple natural language induction problems: morphological segmentation and word segmentation. We identify several problems with the MLE PCFG models of these problems and propose Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) models to overcome them. In order to test these HDP models we develop MCMC algorithms for Bayesian inference of these models from strings alone. Finally, we discuss to what extent the lessons learnt from these examples can be put into a unified framework and applied to the general problem of grammar induction.<br>

  &quot;Which Supervised Learning Method Works Best for What?<br>
  An Empirical Comparison of Learning Methods and Metrics++&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Decision trees are intelligible, but do they perform well enough that you should use them? Have SVMs replaced neural nets, or are neural nets still best for regression, and SVMs best for classification? Boosting maximizes margins similar to SVMs, but can boosting compete with SVMs? And if it does compete, is it better to boost weak models, as theory might suggest, or to boost stronger models? Bagging is simpler than boosting -- how well does bagging stack up against boosting? Breiman said Random Forests are better than bagging and as good as boosting. Was he right? And what about old friends like logistic regression, KNN, and naive bayes? Should they be relegated to the history books, or do they still fill important niches?</p>
<p>In this talk we compare the performance of these supervised learning methods on a number of preformaance criteria: Accuracy, F-score, Lift, Precision/Recall Break-Even Point, Area under the ROC, Average Precision, Squared Error, Cross-Entropy, and Probability Calibration. The results show that no one learning method does it all, but some methods can be &quot;repaired&quot; so that they do very well across all performance metrics. In particular, we show how to obtain the best probabilities from max margin methods such as SVMs and boosting via Platt's Method and isotonic regression. We then describe a new ensemble method that combines select models from these ten learning methods to yield much better performance. Although these ensembles perform extremely well, they are too complex for many applications. We'll describe a model compression method we are developing to fix that. Finally, if time permits, we'll discuss how the performance metrics relate to each other, and which of them you probably should (or shouldn't) use.</p>

  Rich Caruana is a professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at Cornell University. He obtained his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 1997. Most of his research is in machine learning, data mining, and medical decision making. In machine learning he works on inductive transfer (a.k.a. multitask learning), ensemble learning, model calibration (predicting good probabilities), feature selection, missing values, and artificial neural networks. In general, he likes to work on real problems, and develop new learning methods by abstracting what is required to make machine learning work well on those problems.</p>

  &quot;Biologically Inspired Machine Vision&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  The early vision system of insects as well as many higher level organisms exhibit interesting phenomena and features such as analog preprocessing, parallel structure, and sub-pixel resolution.  Early vision is defined as the vision processes that occur within the first few cellular synapses beyond the photoreceptor layer. These features allow for the rapid extraction of image primitives: object edges, boundaries, image segmentation, and movement parameters.  This analog, parallel approach to vision provides advantages over current digital-based imaging system.  The same type of object information can be extracted with a digital-based system; however, extraction usually requires multiple passes of image processing techniques that must be exhaustively applied pixel-by-pixel to an image.  We propose a new approach to the challenge of vision sensor development which takes its inspiration from the obvious success of biological vision systems. This project will use a similar evolutionary, system-level development that has resulted in robust, adaptable vision for so many biological organisms. In this biologically-based systems approach, the sensor (the &quot;eye&quot;) and the computational subsystem (the  &quot;visual cortex&quot;) will be developed together. The sensor design and the computational algorithm design will be made to evolve together as a synergistic, mutually optimized pair; we believe this will greatly increase the probability that successful computer vision will be achieved for a wide variety of medical, commercial, and military applications. This project will advance the state of science in several ways.  First, greater understanding of biological vision will be a benefit. The preprocessing in retinal neural layers and the final processing in the visual cortex is only partially understood today.  By creating analog circuitry that accomplishes some of the preprocessing and computational algorithms that implement the final processing, more complete knowledge of biological vision will be obtained. Second, a more capable and robust computer vision system suitable for intelligent navigation to be achievable for a wide variety of mobile applications such as autonomous wheelchairs and robot movement in hazardous areas is expected.  Furthermore, we believe this research will provide the foundation for the development of a vision prosthetic system.</p>

We propose a new approach to the challenge of vision sensor development which takes its inspiration from the obvious success of biological vision systems. This project will use a similar evolutionary, system-level development that has resulted in robust, adaptable vision for so many biological organisms. In this biologically-based systems approach, the sensor (the &quot;eye&quot;) and the computational subsystem (the &quot;visual cortex&quot;) will be developed together. The sensor design and the computational algorithm design will be made to evolve together as a synergistic, mutually optimized pair; we believe this will greatly increase the probability that successful computer vision will be achieved for a wide variety of medical, commercial, and military applications. This project will advance the state of science in several ways.  First, greater understanding of biological vision will be a benefit. The preprocessing in retinal neural layers and the final processing in the visual cortex is only partially understood today.  By creating analog circuitry that accomplishes some of the preprocessing and computational algorithms that implement the final processing, more complete knowledge of biological vision will be obtained. Second, a more capable and robust computer vision system suitable for intelligent navigation to be achievable for a wide variety of mobile applications such as autonomous wheelchairs and robot movement in hazardous areas is expected.  Furthermore, we believe this research will provide the foundation for the development of a vision prosthetic system.<br>

<p align="center">&quot;Biomechanics of Engineered Heart Valve Tissues&quot;<br>
  Dr. Michael S. Sacks - W.K. Whiteford Professor, Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh<br>
  <strong>February 8, 2007 - 3:30 p.m. - ACE 2.302</strong></p>
<p> On the most basic functional level, heart valves are essentially simple-check valves that serve to prevent retrograde blood flow.  This seemingly simple function belies the structural complexity, elegant solid-fluid mechanical interaction, and durability necessary for normal valve function.  For example, valves are capable of withstanding 30-40 million cycles per year, resulting in a total of ~3 billion cycles insingle lifetime.  No valve made from non-living materials has been able to demonstrate comparable functional performance and durability. However, this staggering level of performance can be cut short by aorticvalve disease, the most common form being stenosis resulting from calcification. Currently, the treatment of aortic valve disease is usually complete valve replacement.  First performed successfully in 1960, surgical replacement of diseased human heart valves by valve prostheses is now commonplace and enhances survival and quality of life for many patients. However, they continue to have significant clinical problems and there is a profound need for new approaches to valve therapies based on sound scientific and engineering principals.</p>
<p> Tissue engineering represents a spectrum of cross-disciplinary technologies aimed toward the repair, replacement, or enhancement of native valve function. Nonwovens fabricated from bioresorbable synthetic polymers (e.g., polyglycolic acid (PGA)) represent one of the earliest, and to date, most ubiquitous biomaterials used as tissue engineering scaffolds.  Their amenability to tissue development, however, belies their intricate microstructure and the concomitant complexity of mechanical interactions occurring between scaffold, cellular, and extracellular matrix constituents in an engineered tissue construct. Mathematical models that simulate the composite mechanical behavior of the scaffold and the developing tissue could potentially facilitate the design of engineered tissues and mechanical conditioning regimens.  Such models could thus play a pivotal role in the design and development of an engineered heart valve. </p>

  ACES 2.402<br>
Host: Lorenzo Alvisi</p>
<p align="center">Talk Title: &quot;Distributed Systems as Databases: Specification, Execution, Debugging&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Developing, deploying, and monitoring the execution of distributed algorithms is a tough job, whether in the context of routing protocols and group communication, within general-purpose overlays, or deeply within focused distributed applications. In P2, a joint research project at Intel Research Berkeley and UC Berkeley, we start with the premise that it is desirable to trade off some design freedom for a more manageable cycle of design, deployment, and testing. Specifically, we treat distributed systems design, at a high level, as a sequence of asynchronous read-modify-write transformations of global ground state --physical connectivity, available resources, policy constraints, past history -- much like how query processors regard traditional database problems. P2 translates such pseudocode-level system specifications into software dataflow graphs made of small, interlinked, reusable components, which it then executes to &quot;run&quot; the specified system. By managing the level of specification -- at pseudocode level, at dataflow graph level, at traditional programming language level -- a programmer can range from a rough-and-ready rapid prototyping experience to an increasingly tuned distributed application.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present an overview of the architecture, design, and implementation of P2. I will then focus on the exciting implications of a highly observable run time system for distributed debugging, on-line global invariant checking, and causality tracking. Finally, I will briefly describe promising preliminary results on specifying global optimization and adaptation tasks as P2 queries themselves, as well as our current directions towards automatic parallelization and causally consistent execution.</p>

<p align="center">Talk Title:  &quot;Monitoring-based Programming and Analysis &quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  We present a tool-supported formal software development framework in which runtime monitoring is a basic design principle, called monitoring-oriented programming (MOP).  In MOP, the developer specifies desired properties using definable formalisms, along with<br>
  code to execute when properties are violated or validated. MOP automatically generates monitors from the specified properties and integrates them together with the user-defined code into the original system.  When used for detecting errors in concurrent systems, monitoring suffers from the same limited coverage as testing. We also present a predictive runtime analysis technique that significantly increases the analysis coverage of monitoring in the context of bug-detection in multithreaded systems, having at its core an improved happen-before causality sliced using static.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Project Fortress&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Fortress is a new programming language designed for high-performance computing with high programmability. In order to explore breakaway approaches to improving programmability, the Fortress design has not been constrained by legacy language syntax or semantics; all aspects of language design for high-performance computing have been rethought from the ground up. As a result, we are able to support features in Fortress such as transactions, specification of locality, and implicit parallel computation, as integral features built into the core of the language. Other features, such as the Fortress component system and test framework, facilitate program assembly and testing, and enable powerful compiler optimizations across library boundaries. Even the syntax and type system of Fortress are custom-tailored to modern high-performance computing, supporting mathematical notation and static hecking of properties such as physical units and dimensions, statictype checking of multidimensional arrays and matrices, and definitions of domain-specific language syntax in libraries. Moreover, Fortress has been designed with the intent that it be a &quot;growable'' language, gracefully supporting the addition of future language features. In fact, much of the Fortress language itself (even the definition of arrays and other basic types) is encoded in libraries atop a relatively small core language. In this talk, we provide a brief overview of Fortress, and discuss the future of the project.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio:<br>
  Eric Allen is a research scientist at Sun Microsystems, where he is a principal investigator of the Fortress project. He is concerned with the design, analysis, and implementation of new language features to increase program robustness and programmer productivity.</p>
<p>Before joining Sun, Eric was an implementor of the NextGen programming language, an extension of the Java^(TM) Programming Language with added experimental features. He was also one of the original programmers on the DrJava project, an open-source IDE designed for interactive, test-driven development, hosted at Rice University. He was the Lead Java Programmer at Cycorp, Inc., and is also author of the book &quot;Bug Patterns in Java&quot;, which discusses common bugs and how to avoid them. He has moderated forums for the online magazine JavaWorld, and has written many online articles on effective programming and debugging.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  This talk will describe my group's ongoing research on effectivelyand practically parallelizing general purpose programs to small scale parallel systems (on the order of about 8 single-threaded superscalar cores). Our approach to this problem has been &quot;careful&quot; speculative parallelization. Data dependences are learned dynamically,to avoid relying on &quot;brittle&quot; compiler analyses and transformations, but enforced conservatively to avoid the low probabilities inherentin techniques like value speculation.  I will describe the compiler techniques we use to find thread boundaries that allow complete control independence of threads, the dynamic slicing technique we use to implement an efficient dynamic dataflow engine, and the dependence prediciton mechanism we use to perform accurate pointer analysis. Together these mechanisms allow us to effectively parallelize general purpose programs without dramatically increasing the number of instructions speculatively fetched or executed.</p>

&quot;How Well Can Physical Machines Approximate the Ideal RAM?&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  It is widely agreed that machines based on sequential programming are increasingly inadequate to fully exploit the potential of present and forthcoming technologies.  However, a rigorous quantitative assessment of the inherent limitations of the sequential approach does not seem to be available.  In this context, we take a look at two interrelated issues:</p>
<p>(a) How well can a physical machine, where information has bounded density and speed, approximate the performance of the ideal Random Access Machine?</p>
<p>(b) How well can the properties of an algorithm that allow for fast execution be encoded in a sequential program, in ways that a machine can automatically exploit?</p>
<p>We will discuss some results shedding light on the above questions, based on novel memory and processor organizations and related algorithm optimization techniques.</p>

<p align="center">Talk Title: &quot;Machine Learning in Web 2.0: Analyzing Dynamic Content- driven Social Networks&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  In the last decade, machine learning and data mining techniques have seen widespread successful application to different Internet technologies, including web search, product recommendation, spam detection, spelling correction, and news clustering. However, the web is fast undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from being a mechanism for delivering static web-content in the existing Web 1.0 model to a platform facilitating dynamic collaborative content creation in the emerging Web 2.0 paradigm. This trend is reflected in the growing popularity of new social web-services, for example, tagging (Flickr) compared to photo editing (Ofoto), and blogging (Blogger) compared to <br>
  homepage hosting (Geocities).</p>
<p> This talk will outline how this new emphasis on rapid creation and sharing of consumer-generated data (CGM) over large social networks has given rise to dynamic content-driven social networks, and a new set of challenging machine learning problems in this context. Focusing on a project (iLink) that the speaker is currently working on, the talk will discuss research problems like online learning of topic models over streaming text, large-scale topic analysis over social networks, and learning to route messages in a social query model.<br>

</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:</p>
<p>This talk presents a novel replicated data protocol that was designed for the WinFS distributed storage system and is being adopted by a variety of Microsoft applications. To meet its scalability demands and support disconnected operation, WinFS selected a weakly-consistent replication model that allows update operations to be performed on any machine without locking.  The replication protocol achieves flexibility from peer-to-peer communication, robustness through its knowledge-driven design, and scalability by utilizing a state-based architecture.  Peer-to-peer means that the protocol allows pairs of machines to synchronize updates independently, thereby sending updated items through an application-specific overlay network.  Knowledge-driven means that sites maintain and exchange summaries of the updates they know, and sites use this information when deciding what items to send during synchronization.  State-based means that sites send updated items from their local databases rather than the sequence of operations that produced those items; the protocol does not rely on a write log but instead utilizes a small amount of metadata associated with each database entry.  The technical contributions of the protocols design include minimizing replication-specific state and efficiently propagating updates while allowing arbitrary synchronization topologies, detecting conflicting updates, supporting automatic conflict resolution, and guaranteeing eventual convergence.<br>

<p align="center">&quot;Organizing P2P Anonymity Systems with Salsa&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Highly distributed anonymous communications systems have the promise of better distribution of trust and improved scalability over more centralized approaches. Existing distributed approaches, however, face security and scalability issues. Requiring nodes to have full knowledge of the other nodes in the system, as in Tor and Tarzan, limits scalability and leads to intersection attacks inpeer-to-peer configurations. MorphMix avoids giving nodes complete system knowledge, but new research shows that a collaborating fraction of the peers can control the paths of many users.</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, we propose Salsa, a structured  approach to organizing highly distributed anonymous communications systems for scalability and security. Salsa is designed to select nodes to be used in anonymous circuits randomly from the full set of nodes, even though each node has knowledge of only a small subset of the network. It uses a distributed hash table based on hashes of the nodes' IP addresses to organize the nodes into groups. With a virtual tree structure, limited knowledge of other nodes is enough to route node lookups throughout the system. We use redundancy and bounds checking when performing lookups to prevent malicious nodes from returning false information without detection. We show that our scheme prevents attackers from biasing path selection, while incurring moderate overheads, as long as the fraction of malicious nodes is less than 20\%. Additionally, the system prevents attackers from obtaining a snapshot of the entire system until the number of attackers grows too large (e.g. 15\% of 10000 peers, given 256 groups). The number of groups can be used as a tunable parameter in the system, depending on the number of peers, that can be used to balance performance and security.</p>

<p align="center">&quot; Cache Oblivious Stencil Computations&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  A stencil describes the computation of a grid point at time step t 1 as a function of neighboring grid points at time step t. This computational pattern arises frequently in scientific computing,for example in explicit finite-difference methods for solving differential<br>
  equations.</p>
<p>In this talk, we discuss a novel algorithm for stencil computations that applies to arbitrary stencils in n-dimensional space. On a machine with an ``ideal cache'' of size Z, for sufficiently large problems, the algorithm computes M grid elements while incurring O(M /Z^{1/n}) cache misses, which matches the lower bound of [Hong and Kung, 1981]. The algorithm is ``cache oblivious:'' it does not contain the cache size Z as a parameter. We also present a cache oblivious multithreaded version for parallel machines, which is capable of amortizing communication latencies.</p>
<p>We applied our algorithms to several applications including LBMHD, a hydrodynamics program from the HPCC suite of DARPA benchmarks. Our cache oblivious sequential version obtains a speedup of 7x with respect to the original code. The performance of our multithreaded version demonstrates that the algorithm relieves the parallel programmer from worrying about data distributions and processor locality. We conclude with a brief discussion of the potential of cache oblivious programs to exploit accelerators, such as FPGA's, with reasonable programming effort.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  When Darwin first proposed his theory of evolution by natural selection, he realized that it had a problem explaining the origins of traits of &quot;extreme perfection and complication&quot; such as the vertebrate eye. Over the years, critics of Darwin's theory have latched onto this perceived flaw as proof that Darwinian evolution is impossible. In anticipation of this issue, Darwin described the perfect data needed to understanding this process, but lamented that such data are &quot;scarcely ever possible&quot; to obtain. In this talk, I will discuss research where we use digital organisms (populations of self-replicating and evolving computer programs) to elucidate the process by which new, highly-complex traits arise, drawing inspiration directly from Darwin's wistful thinking and hypotheses. I will also explore some of the implications of this research to other aspects of evolutionary biology and new ways that these evolutionary principles can be applied toward solving computational problems.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Securing Operating System Integrity Using Binary  Rewriting Techniques at Web Proxies&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Binary rewriting techniques have been developed to allow users to enforce security policies directly on mobile code. However, the performance overheads incurred for improved security, particularly in large organizations with many end-hosts, accentuate the inherent challenges of code rewriting and limit the rate of improvement in these systems. We integrate a binary code rewriter with a web caching proxy and build the security system called PB-JARS, a Proxy-based JAva Rewriting System. PB-JARS compliments existing JVM security mechanisms by placing another line of security defense in the code path code associated with code downloads. It gives system administrators centralized security control at the level of administrative domains at proxy servers. We evaluated PB-JARS using real Java binary traffic models derived from analyzing real web trace records. Our experimental results show that the overhead added by binary rewriting can be significantly amortized by web caching and PB- JARS adds negligible performance impact on proxy servers. The outcome of this research shows that operating system integrity can be significantly improved with ancillary security support that can be provided through perimeter defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Content-based filtering using attack signatures is a widely-adopted defense mechansim against worm attacks and other malware attacks. However, so far, the core of this defense mechanism, signature generation, has largely been a manual process, which can be slow, tedious, inaccurate, and have fundamental limitations to scalability and complexity. In this talk, I will present our recent works towards automatic generation of worm signatures.</p>
<p>I will first talk about pattern-extraction based signature generation where we use machine learning techniques to extract distinguishing features of attack packets to create signatures. I will then talk about some of the fundamental limitations of such pattern-extraction based approach in defending against polymorphic attacks and other malicious attacks. Finally, I will introduce our new approach, language-based methods for automatic generation of vulnerability signatures. A vulnerability signature matches all exploits of a given vulnerability, even polymorphic or metamorphic variants. We propose new techniques using data-flow analysis and constraint solving for automatically generating vulnerability signatures. Our experiments show that we can automatically generate a vulnerability signature using a single exploit which is of much higher quality than previous approaches, demonstrating our approach is a promising direction towards automatic generation of worm signatures. Finally, our techniques have wide applicability beyond signature generation, and I will give some example applications including application dialogue replay.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Many aspects inherent to continued deep-submicron scaling collude to impair the reliability of future microprocessor implementations. This talk develops the idea of &quot;fingerprinting&quot; as an important ingredient for efficient error detection. A fingerprint is a hashed signature of internal state changes of a digital system. For example when applied at the architectural level, one may compute the fingerprint of the register file and/or cache updates. For the purpose of detecting differences in the mirrored operation of two processors, comparing their fingerprints for agreement is nearly as effective as the daunting alternative of comparing instantaneously all their internal states. We present two applications of fingerprinting. The first employs architectural fingerprinting to support dual-modular-redundant execution in a multi-core processor. Fingerprinting and other techniques combine to enable two mirrored cores to maintain redundant execution and checking without requiring them to be microarchitecturally deterministic or to be in precise locked-step. The second work applies microarchitectural-level fingerprinting to extremely-high-coverage detection of transient failures in the datapath that would normally be masked and gone unnoticed at the architectural level. This capability is central to our approach to preemptively detect the on-set of transistor wear-out failures. This talk presents joint work with Prof Babak Falsafi in the TRUSS project (http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~truss/) at the Computer Architecture Lab at Carnegie Mellon (CALCM).</p>

  &quot;Testing Dictators (and hardness of approximating Max-Cut-Gain)&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  &quot;Dictator functions&quot; are functions f : {0,1}^n -&gt; {0,1} of the form f (x) = x_i. Given an unknown function f, a &quot;dictator test&quot; involves querying f(x) at an extremely small number of random points x and performing a test on the results. The test should pass with significantly higher probability when f is a dictator function than when f is far from being a dictator function. The main interest in highly query-efficient dictator tests is that they can usually be transformed into hardness-of-approximation results for basic algorithmic problems like Max-3LIN, Min-Vertex Cover, etc. (using PCP technology).</p>
<p>In this talk we will review some known 2-query and 3-query dictator tests. We will then describe a new 2-query dictator test and show how it leads to an optimal new hardness-of-approximation result for the Max-Cut-Gain problem.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Efficient execution of computationally intensive algorithms requires adapting the code both to the problem and the underlying execution platform. We focus on two important machine resources: processor and memory. In this talk we will present our work on the creation of efficient inner kernels based on a set of simple codes written in a high level language, and letting the compiler do the code optimizations. We then use these kernels in both sparse and dense fields. We will show the process of fine tuning a sparse Cholesky factorization based on a Hypermatrix data structure. We will also present our work on nonlinear data layouts for dense matrix computations.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Automatic Meaning Analysis of Free Text: Small Steps  Towards a Big Goal&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Viewed as a whole, the problem of doing an automatic meaning analysis of free text is huge. But maybe the problem can be carved up in more manageable pieces: Recently several approaches to an automatic predicate-argument structure analysis have been proposed, what has been called a &quot;who does what to whom&quot; analysis. This can be seen as a first building block in a modular meaning analysis (where other, very much necessary, building blocks would include negation and modals). It is an important building block, which focuses on lexical semantics and on the link to semantic taxonomies -- and a building block that has recently become much more accessible, with the availability of manually annotated corpora.</p>
<p>In this talk I first take a closer look at the data for predicate-argument structure, from the viewpoint of a manual annotation effort, where we annotated a German corpus with FrameNet-style information. I then present a system for automatic predicate-argument structure analysis, its architecture and the statistical modeling for its subtasks. Lastly, I discuss a study on cross-lingual semantic analysis -- which opens up the possibility of deriving cross-lingual paraphrases.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  This research offers a fundamental new view of topology optimization. To date, topological synthesis approaches are simply augmentations of existing stochastic optimization techniques. The generic approach defined here combines aspects of existing optimization techniques, graph theory, mathematical programming, artificial intelligence, and shape and graph grammars. Graph transformation research has existed for nearly 40 years in an esoteric corner of artificial intelligence but only recently has the work been deemed useful in design automation as knowledge and heuristics of a particular problem domain can be encapsulated into rules. In this presentation, various example problems are presented that are in the process of being solved by these newly defined search methods.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio:<br>
  Dr. Campbell joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin in 2000, and is currently an Associate Professor in the Manufacturing and Design area. His research focuses on computational methods that aid the engineering designer earlier in the design process than traditional optimization would. To date, he has been awarded $1.57 million in research funding, including the CAREER award for research into a generic graph topology optimization method. This research represents a culmination of past computational synthesis research including the automatic design of sheet metal components, multi-stable MEMS devices, MEMS resonators, function structures, and electro-mechanical configurations. Dr. Campbell is a member of the AAAI, the AIAA, Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, Pi Tau Sigma Mechanical Engineering Honorary Fraternity, the ASME, the ASEE, and the Design Society and has been acknowledged with best paper awards at conferences sponsored by the latter three.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Efficient Software Transactional Memory&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Programmers have traditionally used locks to synchronize concurrentaccess to shared data. Lock-based synchronization, however, has well-known pitfalls including the lack of composability and the possibility of deadlock. Transactional memory provides an alternate concurrency control mechanism that avoids these pitfalls and <br>
  significantly eases concurrent programming. Transactional memory language constructs have recently been proposed as extensions to existing languages or included in new concurrent language specifications, opening the door for new optimizations that target the overheads of transactional memory. In this talk, I discuss compiler and runtime optimizations for transactional memory language constructs and present the high- performance software transactional memory system (STM) being developed at Intel's Programming Systems Lab. Our system, which is integrated into a managed runtime environment, efficiently implements nested transactions that support both composition of transactions and partial roll back. Our JIT compiler is the first to optimize the overheads of STM, and we show novel techniques for enabling JIT optimizations on STM operations. We measure the performance of our optimizations on a 16-way SMP running multi-threaded transactional workloads. Our results show that these techniques enable transactional memory's performance to compete with that of well-tuned synchronization. I will conclude with a discussion of ongoing work on supporting extensions such as strong atomicity and open nested <br>
  transactions in an STM setting.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio:<br>
  Vijay Menon is a research staff member at the Intel Santa Clara labs. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and his PhD from Cornell where he worked with Keshav Pingali on fractal symbolic analysis. He is known for his contributions to software transactional memory and JIT compiling. He will give two talks this Thursday on recent work that has appeared in PLDI and POPL.</p>

<p align="center">Title: Robust Methods for Locating Multiple Dense<br>
  Regions in Complex Datasets<br>
  <strong>Oct 30, 12:30PM, ACES 6.304</strong></p>
<p>Below is an abstract of the thesis. </p>
<p>PS: I will also be presenting just the nonparametric method and a detailed demo of the Gene DIVER product<br>
  at the next BioDM meeting on Nov 3. So there is only a partial overlap between the two talks. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
  Gunjan</p>
<p>A key application of clustering data obtained from sources such as DNA microarrays, protein mass spectroscopy, and phylogenetic profiles is the detection of functionally related genes. Typically, only a small number of functionally related genes cluster into one or more groups, and the rest need to be pruned. For such situations, this thesis presents several techniques that cluster only a subset of the data.</p>
<p>We first develop a very general parametric approach called Bregman Bubble Clustering that can find multiple dense regions, and can scale to very large datasets. By using a fast iterative relocation based approach combined with a novel concept for improving local search called Pressurization, Bregman Bubble Clustering extends density-based clustering to a much larger set of problems. We also develop a seeding algorithm that can automatically determine the number of clusters, and make the results deterministic. </p>
<p>We then describe a more focussed non-parametric alternative called Automated Hierarchical Density Shaving (Auto-HDS), a framework that consists of a fast, hierarchical, density-based clustering algorithm and an unsupervised model selection strategy. Auto-HDS can automatically select between clusters of different densities, present them in a compact hierarchy, and rank individual clusters using an innovative stability criteria. The Auto-HDS framework also provides a simple yet powerful 2-D visualization of the hierarchy of clusters that is useful for further exploring the dense clusters in high-dimensional datasets. We also developed a robust, memory efficient, platform independent, and open source Java based implementation of Auto-HDS called Gene DIVER (Gene Density Interactive Visual Explorer) that provides interactive clustering capabilities for high-throughput biological datasets. </p>
<p>For problems where finding small dense regions is important, the parametric approach is applicable to a wide variety of scenarios and is scalable to very large datasets. On the other hand, Auto-HDS, the non-parametric approach, provides a powerful visualization, a compact clustering hierarchy, and interactive clustering: properties that are useful for biologists interested in finding and understanding small dense clusters of genes. Together, the two approaches greatly extend the scope of density based clustering in three different dimensions; the diversity of problems that density-based clustering can now be used with, the expanded capability to quickly understand and analyze the clusters in the data, and the scale of the problems that are now within reach of modest computing resources. </p>

<p>Abstract: </p>
<p>We will discuss the work of the Quake Project on large-scale forward and inverse earthquake modeling. After some initial comments on forward modeling, we will focus on the inverse problem of estimating the earth model from observations of ground motion of past earthquakes. We will discuss such compounding issues as extreme large scale, ill-posedness, discontinuous solutions, multigrid optimization preconditioners, nonlinear convergence difficulties, and multiple local minima, as well as techniques for addressing them on multi-thousand processor terascale supercomputers. We will end with a discussion of some outstanding challenges and the prospects for earthquake inversion to frequencies of engineering interest on petascale-class computers.</p>

<p> The need (1) for biomaterials with properties similar to those of physiological tissues (most of them characterized by surface grain sizes in the nanometer range), and (2) for identification of the optimal conditions that maximize specific functions of cells responsible for neotissue formation has motivated the study of nanostructured materials (that is, materials with grain sizes less than 100 nm in at least one dimension). </p>
<p>Cellular, in vitro models provided the following, supporting evidence. Compared to pure ceramics, nanophase ceramics (specifically, alumina, titania, and hydroxylapatite) as well as polymer/nanophase-ceramic composites (for example, poly(L-lactic) acid) with the aforementioned nanophase ceramics) promoted interactions (i.e., adhesion and subsequent cell functions which are pertinent to new bone tissue formation) of specific cell types (for example, osteoblasts but not fibroblasts) and also exhibited improved mechanical properties; composites of poly (L-lactic) acid. Investigation of the underlying mechanism(s) revealed that the type, amount and conformation of adsorbed proteins (namely, vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagen) mediated subsequent cell (such as osteoblast, fibroblast, and adult mesenchymal stem cell) interactions with nanostructured materials.</p>
<p>Insightful understanding of how nanostructured material surfaces modulate protein/substrate interactions is needed. Pertinent material structure and properties, material synthesis and preparation methodologies, as well as the mechanisms of biomolecular interactions with such substrates must be identified and elucidated in order to design and fabricate the next generation of nanostructured biomaterials. Biomaterials, which reliably and predictably promote specific interactions of biomolecules leading to modulation and/or control of subsequent functions of select mammalian cells, have the potential of novel biotechnological applications and of major clinical impact. </p>

  &quot;Soft-State BioASICs and nSERS for Quantitative Systems Biology.&quot;<br>
  <strong>Thursday, October 19 - 3:30 p.m. - ACE 2.302</strong></p>
<p>In order to create High-content Integrated Quantitative Molecular Diagnostics (iQMD) on a chip, Biofluidic Application Specific Integrated Circuits (BioASICs) and quantum nanoplasmonic probes are developed. Soft-state BioASICs are created by connecting existing and novel microfluidic circuits for high-content experimental biology in new ways. We are creating a library of these &quot;building blocks&quot; to develop multifunctional biological microprocessors. To build a solid foundation of future high-speed microfluidic bioprocessor for experimental biology and biomarker discovery, we have developed design rules and critical modules of BioASICs such as single cell analysis chip, integrated multiple patch-clamp chip, dynamic cell culture array, on-chip cell lysing device, sample preparation chip, cell separation device, high-density single cell analysis chip, molecular harvesting device,<br>
  cell-cell communication array, artificial livers on-a-chip for drug metabolism and toxicity studies in vitro, and integrated nanofluidic surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (nSERS) platforms for label-free<br>
genomics or proteomics.</p>
<p>For nanoscale spectroscopic molecular imaging and photothermal therapeutic applications, nanocrescents are developed. The formation of asymmetric nanophotonic crescent structure is accomplished by the interfacing both bottom-up and top-down methods, which allows to create effective local field enhancement structures, batch nanofabrication, and precise controls of hot spot coupling distance for in-vivo molecular imaging. Gold-based nanocrescents have structures with a sub-10 nm sharp edge, which can enhance local electromagnetic field at the edge area. The advanced nanocrescent SERS probes can be applied for sensitive molecular detection and electron transfers of biomolecules. The iQMD on a chip using functional BioASICs and label-free nSERS will contribute on systems biology and quantitative medicine.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  For dynamic Finite Element Method applications, existing sparse direct solvers can be said to solve the wrong problem. They optimize the solution of a single linear system, while the real problem is to solve a series of systems that are derived from gradual h/p refinement of a FEM discretization. We propose a new type of direct sparse solver that is able to reuse the parts of the factorization corresponding to the not refined parts of the domain. Such a solver is eminently suited to the dynamic case, and we will present evidence that even for a single system it is space and time efficient. Furthermore, it integrates in a natural way in the workflow of the dynamic application.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Future CPU Architectures: the Shift from Traditional Models&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  While Moore's law is alive and well in silicon scaling technology, it is clear that microprocessors have encountered significant technical issues that will influence the overall direction of the future architectures.  This talk discusses the recent history of Intel microprocessors, some of the rational that guided the development of those processors. Further, the talk highlights why the future microprocessor architectures will likely look different from the past.</p>
<p>The traditional microprocessor architecture uses hardware  techniques such as out-of-order processing to extract higher performance out of applications that have little or no explicit parallelism. The hardware techniques employed in the past have continued to improve performance, but at the cost of significantly increasing the power consumption of the traditional microprocessors. The power increases have led to not only higher electrical power delivery costs, but higher costs dissipating the power, resulting in high ambient noise, larger enclosure and hotter laps. To avoid a future that requires asbestos based jeans to properly handle laptops, the microprocessor architecture must change to facilitate higher performance without significantly higher power.</p>
<p>It is likely that microprocessor architecture will evolve from the ubiquitous single core, single threaded machine that we know and love, to an architecture that employs more cores and more threads. This shift is apparent in today's market where general purpose processors have included techniques such as Hyper-Threading Technology and Multi-Core processors. This talk will speculate on some potential next steps for that technology and some of the potential implications on software development.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Scalable Realistic Rendering of Complex Scenes&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  A fundamental challenge in computer graphics is realistically simulating the appearance of complex natural scenes; we want to create virtual environments that accurately represent the real world.  Such virtual environments are vital for a wide variety of applications such as engineering design, games and movies, architectural planning, search-and-rescue and surgical training, e-commerce, and cultural heritage and preservation. It is currently too expensive to accurately simulate the interaction of light in complex scenes. Conventional rendering methods remain orders of magnitude too slow for interactive use and often use ad-hoc approximations that are visibly inaccurate.</p>
<p>In this talk I will present my group's research on scalable, perceptually-based rendering and modeling for complex scenes.  The key insight is not to simulate what the human eye cannot perceive.  Exploiting perception makes these algorithms scalable: computational cost remains low as scene complexity increases, unlike with conventional rendering. I will describe our research on lightcuts for multiscale illumination, cinematic relighting, and feature-based textures and detail synthesis for image-based texturing.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Technology has been a main performance driver of many system generations, leveraging CMOS scaling to increase clock speed and build increasingly complex microarchitectures. As technology-driven performance gains becomes increasingly harder to achieve from device scaling alone, innovative system architecture must take its place.</p>
<p>We will discuss how technology has matured, and its impact on microprocessor and system architecture. Increasingly, to optimize performance for a system, a holistic approach optimizing across the entire hardware and software stack must be considered to optimize for a range of metrics: performance, power, power/performance, reliability and ease of use.</p>
<p>We will describe how this integrated design approach helped shape the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. Blue Gene was designed from the ground up with a focus on power/performance efficiency and reliability. The ultimate goal was to achieve extreme scalability and high application performance under the power and thermal constraints of existing data centers. To ensure optimal system operation, Blue Gene/L is an integrated solution combining innovative system software, tools, architecture, system design, and packaging at all levels. </p>

<p align="center">&quot;Making distributed systems secure by construction&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  The distributed information systems we use every day are becoming more complex and interconnected. Can we trust them with our information? Many mechanisms are available to ensure information security: for example, encryption, various cryptographic protocols, access control, and replication.  Currently there is no good way to check that complex distributed software uses information securely, even if we have the source code. We currently lack both sufficiently expressive ways to specify information security requirements, and sufficiently accurate methods for checking them.</p>
<p>This talk describes a way to build systems that are secure by construction. Programs are annotated with explicit security policies specifying the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The compiler automatically<br>
  uses a combination of techniques to transform the source code to run securely on the available host machines. The<br>
  compiler introduces quorum replication to satisfy both integrity and availability policies. It introduces partitioning, encryption, and one-way hashing to satisfy confidentiality policies. To accommodate the needs of realistic applications, the information security policies are also enriched to support new notions of ownership, declassification, robustness, and erasure. These policies have precise semantics, and the construction process can be shown to enforce policies in terms of these semantics.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  The familiar Radon transform calculates the projections of an image at various angles.  Its inverse, important in computerized tomography, reconstructs the image; this is generally done by discretization of  the continuous equations, giving an approximate result.  We show that a certain kind of discrete Radon transform has an exact, fast inverse that exactly reproduces the pixel-by-pixel values of the original image. Fourier methods are not used or needed.  We also show new generalizations of this transform to operations other than sums along lines, including some that may have novel applications in signal processing.</p>

&quot;Towards the Incorporation of Dynamic Adaptation into Operating Systems&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  In the context of the DAiSES (Dynamic Adaptability in Support of Extreme Scale) research project, which is funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science, we are investigating ways to incorporate adaptation into operating systems, either by varying parameter values or policies at runtime. As compared to conventional operating systems with statically defined parameters and policies, such operating systems offer the potential for improved performance. In response to changing workload characteristics or requirements, operating system (OS) adaptation is meant to dynamically customize the OS in an attempt to provide best service, based on predefined criteria, for the active workload. This phase of our research focuses on conventional operating systems, but hopefully this experience will lay the foundation for addressing adaptation in operating systems for extreme scale systems.</p>
<p>Current DAiSES research activities focus on three adaptation targets: disk scheduling, virtual memory management, and file I/O. These initial targets were chosen based on evidence of the potential performance gains that could be achieved by varying associated parameters and policies. To improve performance in any one of these ways, we study the correlation among workload characteristics/requirements, the relevant OS parameter values and/or policies, and achievable performance gains as measured by predefined performance metrics. These relationships, which are challenging to establish, in conjunction with the system state, measured at runtime, dictate the adaptation process.</p>
<p>Thus far, disk scheduling has received most of our attention, and will be a major focus of this talk. It is a target for OS adaptation via policy change, while, for example, virtual memory management is a target for adaptation of OS parameter values. In terms of disk scheduling, we have designed a new disk scheduling strategy that leverages a fair queuing discipline and implements a fair scheduling algorithm that can satisfy different performance requirements for different concurrently executing applications. Because this strategy is fair in terms of allocated disk time, it provides performance isolation among applications and, therefore, predictable disk performance for each application, which facilitates providing quality of service guarantees. Currently, this<br>
strategy is being used to support adaptation of policies.</p>

Different techniques to reduce static power consumption have been developed in the research environment. The Way Adaptable D-Nuca cache represents the results of our activity on applying such techniques to large, wire delay dominated, L2 caches.  In a Way Adaptable D-Nuca cache, by exploiting typical features of D-NUCA design, we dynamically activate or deactivate entire ways on the basis of the application working set, thus adapting the size of the powered-on portion of L2 cache to the needs of the running applications. This imply a reduction of L2 cache static power consumption with negligible performance degradation .and also some other little but perhaps surprising effects.</p>

<p>The growth of pathogen nucleic acid sequence information in the public domain invites the direct use of that information for broad-spectrum respiratory pathogen surveillance.   Investigators at the NRL have combined methods for microbial nucleic acid enrichment, random nucleic acid amplification, gene resequencing, and automated sequence similarity searching of public gene databases for biosurviellance.  NRL, in collaboration with the AF, demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by provided medical biosurveillance for the National Capital Area during the months surrounding the Presidential Inauguration in a 24/7 operation.  Subsequent development has refined the technology to provide better than 95% clinical specificity and sensitivity.  While the initial microarray detected any of 25 pathogens and near neighbors, a chip capable of detecting 120 microorganisms has now been fabricated.  An automated sample processing system has also been designed and component fabrication initiated.</p>

  &quot;Electronic Voting: Risks and Research&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Hanging chads, among other issues with traditional voting systems, have sparked great interest in managing the election process through the use of newer electronic voting systems. While computer scientists, for the most part, have been warning of the perils of such action, vendors have forged ahead with their products, claiming increased security, reliability, and accuracy.  Many municipalities have adopted electronic systems and the number of deployed systems is rising.  To the limited extent that independent security analyses have been published, the results have raised serious reservations about the quality of these systems to resist attacks.  This talk will describe problems we and other researchers have discovered and will consider the limitations of the certification processes that should have guaranteed some quality control.  These issues, in turn, give rise to a variety of interesting research problems that span computer science, human factors, and public policy.  In this talk, we will consider how both established and open research in software engineering, distributed systems, and cryptography can and should impact the next generation of voting systems.</p>

&quot;Behind the Scenes with Blondie24: Evolving Intelligence in Checkers and Chess&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Blondie24 is a self-learning checks program that taught itself to play at the level of human experts. Starting with only rudimentary information about the location, number, and types of checkers pieces on the board, Blondie24 learned to play well enough to be ranked in the top 500 of 120,000 checkers players registered at Microsoft's zone.com. The program uses a simple evolutionary algorithm to optimize neural networks as board evaluators. Any sophisticated features used to interpret the positions of pieces were invented within the neural network. Furthermore, the evolving neural networks were not told whether they won, lost, or drew any specific game; instead, the only feedback they received was a point score associated with an overall result of playing a random number of games. In so doing, the line of research addressed two fundamental issues raised by Arthur Samuel and Allen Newell over three decades ago: Can a computer invent features in checkers and can a computer learn how play without receiving explicit credit assignment? A similar process has also been applied to chess (Blondie25). Starting with an open source program rated about 1800 (Class A), the evolved program has demonstrated grandmaster-level performance.  The lecture will provide motivation and technical details for this research, as well as offer materials not found in any technical or book treatments of the development.  Attendees will be able to challenge Blondie to a game, if they like.</p>

&quot;Meaning Machines&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  People use words to refer to the world as a means for influencing the beliefs and actions of others. Although many isolated aspects of the structure and use of language have been extensively studied, a unified model of situated language use remains unexplored. Any attempt to explain unconstrained adult language use appears futile due to the overwhelming complexity of the physical, cognitive, and cultural factors at play. A strategy for making progress towards a holistic account of language use is to study simple forms of language (e.g., conversational speech about objects and events in the here-and-now in limited social contexts) and strive for &quot;vertically integrated&quot; computational models. I will present experiments guided by this strategy in building conversational robots and natural language interfaces for video games. An emerging framework suggests a semiotic perspective may be useful for designing systems that process language grounded in social and physical context.</p>

  &quot;Building Reliable Metaclassifiers for Text Learning&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Appropriately combining information sources is a broad topic that has been researched in many forms. It includes sensor fusion, distributed data-mining, regression combination, classifier combination, and even the basic classification problem. After all, the hypothesis a classifier emits is just a specification of how the information in the basic features should be combined.  This talk addresses one subfield of this domain: leveraging locality when combining classifiers for text classification. Classifier combination is useful, in part, as an engineering aid that enables machine learning scientists to understand differences in base classifiers in terms of their local reliability, dependence, and variance -- much as higher-level languages are an abstraction that improves upon assembly language without extending its computational power.</p>
<p>After discussing and introducing improved methods for recalibrating classifiers, we define local reliability, dependence, and variance and discuss the roles they play in classifier combination.  Using these insights, we motivate a series of reliability-indicator variables which intuitively abstract the input domain to capture the local context related to a classifier's reliability.</p>
<p>We then present our main methodology, STRIVE. STRIVE employs a metaclassification approach to learn an improved model which varies the combination rule by considering the local reliability of the base classifiers via the indicators.  The resulting models empirically outperform state-of-the-art metaclassification approaches that do not use locality. Next, we analyze the contributions of the various reliability indicators to the combination model and suggest informative features to consider when redesigning the base classifiers. Additionally, we show how inductive transfer methods can be extended to increase the amount of labeled training data for learning a combination model by collapsing data traditionally viewed as coming from different learning tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, the combination approaches discussed are broadly applicable to classification problems other than topic<br>
  classification, and we emphasize this with experiments that demonstrate STRIVE improves performance of action-item detectors in e-mail -- a task where both the semantics and base classifier performance are significantly different than topic classification.</p>

  Theoretical Framework for Vascular Growth and Remodeling<br>
  <strong>Thursday, August 24, 2006- 3:30 to 5:00pm - ACES 6.304</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  Research over the last three decades has revealed a ubiquitous cell-mediated growth and remodeling in arterial development, adaptation, and response to disease/injury, and has demonstrated that these processes are controlled in large part by mechanical stimuli. Although the response of an artery to disease/injury versus perturbed blood pressures, flows, and axial loads may be manifested differently, the basic underlying processes appear to be the same. Arterial adaptation results from changes in cellular activity that include changes in the rates of mitosis (cell division) or apoptosis (programmed cell death), rates of cell migration and differentiation (change of phenotype), hypertrophy and atrophy, and rates of synthesis, degradation, or cross-linking of extracellular matrix. Overall, therefore, what appear to be most important mechanically are the separate rates of turnover of individual constituents and the evolving configurations in which such turnover occurs. The goal of this work is to formulate a theoretical framework to model basic features of the biomechanics of arterial growth and remodeling and to incorporate this theory into finite element codes for purposes of simulation. The framework is motivated by the hypothesis that growth and remodeling occurs via the heightened replacement of previously existing constituents with new constituents that have new ~Qnatural configurations~R but otherwise similar mechanical properties. Towards this end, the stress response of each structurally-dominant constituent is modeled using a constrained mixture approach, within the context of finite elasticity, and the turnover of each constituent can be modeled using explicit kinetics. Given the current lack of sufficient data, competing hypotheses are explored via simulations. Although there is clearly a need to evolve more sophisticated models, it is hoped that the present basic concepts and associated constrained mixture framework will serve to motivate appropriate new experiments and to focus advances in the modeling.</p>

  &quot;Automating the verification of machine-level programs for operational machines&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  We propose an approach to automating the verification of machine-level programs for an arbitrary abstract computing machine provided that the semantics is given formally by an operational semantics (satisfying certain broad constraints). Using the tool described here, a user with a formal operational semantics model of a computing machine (in ACL2) can automatically verify a large class of programs for that machine. The tool is independent of the particular operational semantics. That is, given a machine defined operationally, e.g., the JVM, a piece of machine-level program, e.g., a Java byte-code program, and a specification of this piece of program, we show how to automatically generate an ACL2 book, which states the correctness of the program and includes lemmas that will lead ACL2, automatically, to the proof of the correctness. If the book cannot be processed automatically, the user may still edit it to insert additional lemmas as needed. We automate all but the ``creative'' part of the proof. While we demonstrate our technique for a JVM model, the technique applies generally to any model (within certain broad constraints). We demonstrate it on several simpler operational models.</p>

  &quot;Improving BGP Performance Under Large Scale Internet  Failures&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Border gateway protocol (BGP) is the default routing protocol between various autonomous systems (AS) in the Internet. In the event of a failure, BGP may repeatedly withdraw some routes and advertise new ones until a stable state is reached. This could take a long time and is often associated with high packet drop rates.  Much of the previous work on BGP failures has examined only isolated failures scenarios. In this talk we shall motivate the case for large scale Internet failures and show that BGP performance can degrade substantially in this case. We then consider several improvements to BGP which can be implemented rather easily and do not require any coordination between ASes.  It is shown that the BGP convergence delays can be reduced substantially by these techniques. We also consider the question of whether convergence time is the most appropriate performance metric and consider a few other metrics as well.</p>

  Talk Title:  &quot;Transactions, Now and for the Future&quot;</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  With the advent of desktop multiprocessors, and even chip multiprocessors, concurrency is increasingly recognized as the next major trend in programming.  Unfortunately, the current state of the art in concurrent programming is woefully inadequate: The dominant abstraction for communication--shared memory mediated by locks--is the equivalent of assembly code for concurrent programs: it shields you from the bare machine but does not provide an adequate means for further abstraction.   As a result, large concurrent programs are fragile (and almost always incorrect), stifling innovation and threatening reliability.  As the world grows increasingly dependent on interconnected computing, we can ill afford such programs.</p>
<p>Transactions--atomic blocks of code--have been proposed as a mechanism for structuring large-scale concurrent programs.  They have been used successfully for decades in database systems, and there is renewed interest in providing &quot;lightweight transactions&quot; at other levels of the system: at the language level, and even in hardware.  However, there are fundamental challenges, for both semantics and implementation, to making lightweight transactions available and accessible to programmers in general.  Our group at Sun (and many others) has been exploring and devising mechanisms for supporting transactions, both at the language level  and in hardware.  I will talk about the benefits of transactional programming, the challenges in making it feasible, and some work that we are doing to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio:<br>
  Victor Luchangco works in the Scalable Synchronization Research Group of Sun Microsystems Laboratories. His research focuses on developing algorithms and mechanisms to support concurrent programming on large-scale distributed systems.  He also works with the Programming Languages Research Group on the development of Fortress, a new language for high-productivity scientific computing.</p>
<p>Victor is a theoretician by disposition and training, but he is also interested in practical aspects of computing. In particular, he would like to design mechanisms that people will actually use.   In addition, he is interested in exploring how to make proofs for concurrent systems easier, both by changing how people design these systems and by using tools to aid in formal verification.</p>

  &quot;Fast Solvers for Elliptic and Parabolic Problems''<br>
  <strong>Thursday, May 25, 2006 - 3:30 to 5:00 pm - ACES 6.304</strong></p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  In this talk I will discuss algorithms for the solution of the Poisson (for the exterior and interior problem for a domain with smooth but complex boundary) and heat equations (for an interior problem with smooth, moving boundary).</p>
<p>Analytic solutions are available only for a limited number of cases. Therefore we need to use numerical techniques.  The basic goals in designing a numerical method are guaranteed quality (i.e., error bounds) of the solution, linear complexity, and robustness. Surprisingly, a robust, black-box, algorithmically scalable method for the Poisson problem does not exist. The main difficulty is related to provably good mesh generation in complex geometries in three dimensions, and provable design of O(N) solvers for unstructured meshes.</p>
<p>I will review different approaches in solving elliptic and parabolic problems and discuss algorithmic issues for methods based on classical Fredholm integral equation formulation. For the elliptic problem, the main components of the new method are a kernel-independent fast summation method, manifold surface representations, and superalgebraically accurate quadrature methods. For the parabolic problem the main component is the design of appropriate quadratures that combined with spectral basis can deliver spectral accuracy.</p>

  Talk Title: &quot;DieHard: Probabilistic Memory Safety for Unsafe Languages&quot;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Applications written in unsafe languages like C and C are vulnerable to memory errors such as buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and reads of uninitialized data. Such errors can lead to program crashes, security vulnerabilities, and unpredictable behavior. We present DieHard, a runtime system that tolerates these errors while probabilistically maintaining soundness. DieHard uses randomization and replication to achieve probabilistic memory safety by <br>
  approximating an infinite-sized heap. DieHard's memory manager randomizes the location of objects in a heap that is at least twice as large as required. This algorithm prevents heap corruption and provides a probabilistic guarantee of avoiding memory errors. For additional safety, DieHard can operate in a replicated mode where multiple replicas of the same application are run simultaneously. By initializing each replica with a different random seed and requiring agreement on output, the replicated version of DieHard increases the likelihood of correct execution because errors are unlikely to have the same effect across all replicas. We present analytical and experimental results that show DieHard's resilience to a wide range of memory errors, including a heap-based buffer overflow in an actual application (the Squid web cache) and a recent dangling pointer error in Mozilla Firefox.</p>

  Talk Title: &quot;Towards Efficient Boolean Circuit Satisfiability Checking&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Boolean circuits offer a natural, structured, and compact representation of Boolean functions for many application domains such as computer aided verification. We study satisfiability checking methods for Boolean circuits. As a starting point we take the successful Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure for satisfiability checking of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form and study its generalization to Boolean circuits. We employ a tableau formulation where DPLL propagation rules correspond to tableau deduction rules and splitting corresponds to a tableau cut rule. It turns out that Boolean circuits enable interesting deduction (simplification) rules not typically available in DPLL where the idea is to exploit the structure of the circuit. We also study the relative efficiency of different variations of the cut (splitting) rule obtained by restricting the use of cut in several natural ways. A number of exponential separation results are obtained showing that the more restricted variations cannot polynomially simulate the less restricted ones. The results also apply to DPLL for formulas in conjunctive normal form obtained from Boolean circuits by using Tseitin's translation. Thus DPLL with the considered cut restrictions, such as allowing splitting only on the variables corresponding to the input gates, cannot polynomially simulate DPLL with unrestricted splitting.</p>

  &quot;Place-Its: A Study of Location-Based Reminders on Mobile Phones&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Mobile phones promise to replace the desktop as the predominant computing-and-communications platform. Yet, simply reproducing desktop application genres -- e-mail, web browsing, and streaming video, to name a few -- in a small form-factor cannot achieve this promise. A new vision for mobile computing is required. A critical yet under-explored element of this vision is the use of personal context.</p>
<p>For example, early studies showed that context-awareness can improve the usefulness of automated reminders, but little is known about how a context-aware reminder application might be used throughout a person's daily life. Mobile phones provide a potentially convenient and truly ubiquitous platform for the detection of personal context such as location, as well as the delivery of reminders. To study people using location-aware reminders throughout their daily lives, we designed Place-Its, a location-based reminder application that runs on mobile phones. This talk describes the design of Place-Its and a two week exploratory user study. The study reveals that location-based reminders are useful, in large part because people use location in nuanced ways.</p>
<p>Other on-going projects relating to mobile phones are briefly discussed.</p>

&quot;Time Hierarchies for Semantic Models of Computation&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  A basic question in computational complexity asks whether somewhat more time allows us to solve strictly more decision problems on a given model of computation. Despite its fundamental nature, the question remains unanswered for many models of interest. Essentially, time hierarchies are known for every syntactic model of computation but open for everything else, where we call a model syntactic if there exists a computable enumeration consisting exactly of the machines in the model.</p>
<p>There has been significant progress in recent years, namely in establishing time hierarchies for non-syntactic models with small advice. In this talk, we survey these results and present a generic theorem that captures and strengthens all of them. We show that for virtually any semantic model of computation and for any rationals 1 <br>
  &lt;= c &lt; d, there exists a language computable in time n^d with one bit of advice but not in time n^c with one bit of advice, where we call a model semantic if there exists a computable enumeration that contains all machines in the model but may also contain others.</p>
<p>Our result implies the first such hierarchy theorem for randomized machines with zero-sided error, quantum machines with one-or zero- sided error, unambiguous machines, symmetric alternation, Arthur- Merlin games of any signature, etc. Our argument also yields considerably simpler proofs of earlier hierarchy theorems with one bit of advice for randomized or quantum machines with two-sided error.</p>

&quot;Enabling Declarative Applications in Immersive Sensor Networks&quot;</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  As sensor networks become increasingly ubiquitous, future scenarios in which multiple mobile applications will leverage sensor network nodes opportunistically and unpredictably will become possible. Such scenarios deviate from existing deployments of sensor networks which are often highly application-specific and generally funnel information to a central collection service for a single purpose. A significant barrier to the widespread development of such flexible sensor network applications lies in the increased complexity of the programming task when compared to existing distributed or even mobile situations.  Sensor nodes are severely resource-constrained, in terms of both computational capabilities and battery power, and therefore an application development task must inherently consider low-level design concerns. This complexity, coupled with the increasing demand for applications, highlights the need for programming platforms (i.e., middleware) that simplify application development.</p>
<p>This talk introduces the DAIS (Declarative Applications in Immersive Sensor networks) middleware platform that enables the development of these adaptive ubiquitous computing applications. Our approach focuses on minimizing communication in the sensor network to best ensure the network's lifetime. DAIS localizes data collection and sensor interaction to only the regions of the network required for the applications' immediate data needs. At the programming interface level, this requires exposing some aspects of the physical world to the developer, and DAIS accomplishes this through novel programming abstractions that enable on-demand access to dynamic data sources.</p>
<p>The talk will overview the middleware and provide details of two of its components: the scene communication abstraction and virtual sensors, including both programmatic examples and performance results.</p>

<p>The symposium, free and open to the public, will feature a week of activities (April 24-28) at The University of Texas at Austin. The keynote address by Prothrow-Stith, professor of public health practice and associate dean for faculty development at Harvard, is at 7 p.m., April 28 at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Auditorium, 2315 Red River St.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Prothrow-Stith is a nationally recognized public health leader and is intimately knowledgeable about the range of issues associated with health care disparities, as well as health care issues in general,&quot; said Terry Wilson, chairman of the Sweatt Symposium Steering Committee and associate vice president in the Office of Community and School Relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Each year we seek to bring a speaker to the Sweatt Symposium who will enlighten our campus community and the greater Austin community about an important topic,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;Dr. Prothrow-Stith continues that tradition. It is our hope that students and others become better informed about critical issues affecting not only their personal health, but the collective health of the community as well.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the National Healthcare Disparities Report released in 2004 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality:</p>
<p>*When compared with Caucasians, minorities are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer and colorectal cancer. <br>
  *Patients of lower socioeconomic position are less likely to receive recommended diabetic services and more likely to be hospitalized for diabetes and its complications. <br>
  *When hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, Hispanics are less likely to receive optimal care. <br>
  *Many racial and ethnic minorities and people of lower socioeconomic position are more likely to die from HIV. <br>
  *Minorities account for a disproportionate share of new AIDS cases. <br>
  *African Americans and poorer patients have higher rates of avoidable hospital admissions (hospitalizations for health conditions that, in the presence of comprehensive primary care, rarely require hospitalization). </p>
<p>The symposium is named for Heman Sweatt (1912-1982), who applied for admission to The University of Texas School of Law in 1946, but was denied admission on the basis of race. Sweatt brought legal action against the university. In a landmark case, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in favor of Sweatt helped pave the way for the admission of African Americans to formerly segregated colleges and universities throughout the United States.</p>

  ACES 2.302</p>
<p align="left">That cells are able to survive and function is partly due to specific, noncovalent binding of pairs of molecules -- biomolecular recognition -- within the heavy molecular traffic in and around cells. Timely binding of the correct molecular partners is critical in signal transduction, the expression of genetic information, the assembly of cellular components, and all other cellular activities. Molecular recognition is also central to many disease processes and medical therapies. Continuing advances in computational and structural biology will provide a deeper understanding of how biological activity at the cellular and higher levels emerges from the molecular level. Some early efforts toward this synthesis will be described, with special reference to neuronal activity.</p>

  &quot;On Eigenvalue Problems of Shells of Revolution&quot;<br>
  <strong>Thursday, April 20, 2006 - 3:30 to 5:00 pm</strong><br>
ACES 6.304</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  We consider the eigenvalue problem of thin shells of revolution.We demonstrate through numerical experiments (FEM) that the shell geometry plays an important role also in the eigenvalue problems. For the special case of clamped cylinder we analyze the smallest eigenvalue as a function of the shell thickness t, the asymptotic behavior of the respective eigenfunctions, and how the different displacements components and parts of the energy scale in t. As a consequence, we are able to single out the numerical difficulties of the problem, which, surprisingly for a bending inhibited problem, include the presence of locking.</p>

  &quot;Geo-Cybernetics: a New Avenue of Research&quot;<br>
  <strong>Tuesday, April 18, 2006 - 2:00 to 3:30 pm</strong> <br>
ACES 6.304</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  The term &quot;Sgeo-cybernetics&quot; was first proposed in 2005 by Reyes et.al.(Cartographica, volume 41, issue 1).  In short, the adoption of a cyberneticperspective in societal problems where geographic knowledge and information plays a key role has shown to be a fruitful avenue of research in Geomatics. The need to use geo-spatial knowledge and modeling resources in order to respond to complex problems posed by society requires an approach that is user-centered and demand-driven, building a bridge between science and society. During the last seven years, CentroGeo has advanced on empirical results andmethodological and theoretical frameworks around three concepts: cybercartography, complex solution in geomatics and collective mental maps. The cybernetic essence in the empirical and theoretical development of these three concepts that are intertwined has been one of the key elements in the advancement of this innovative approach. The conclusion is that it is worthwhile to continue exploring theinterrelationship between cybernetics and geomatics expecting to advance on an initial theoretical framework for a comprehensive avenue of research that has been named as geo-cybernetics. (Joint work with Elvia Martinez)</p>
<p>Dr. Reyes is currently the General Director of CentroGeo, a Mexican research institution whose main focus is the application of Geographic Information Sciences to build a bridge between science and society. Dr. Reyes is one of the main authors of the recently published book &quot;Cybercartography, Theory and Practice&quot;, Elsevier 2005. http://www.centrogeo.org.mx/</p>

  &quot;Ubiquitous Computing Middleware: Application Sessions for Dynamic Environments&quot;<br>
Host: Suzanne Barber, Director, EDGE Center</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
  Building applications for any distributed environment has always been a difficult task.  Introducing the demands of mobile and pervasive devices such as dynamic connections and limited resources are further increasing these software engineering burdens.  These inherent complexities are coupled with usage trends that are demanding applications be developed and deployed at alarming rates.  The expertise required to rapidly build robust applications in these environments is expensive and rare.  This talk will discuss the benefits of using middleware solutions to bridge the gap between the applications demanded by consumers and the capabilities of software engineers to produce those applications quickly and correctly.</p>
<p>Middleware solutions in general abstract the complexities of an environment to simplify programming sophisticated applications.  The talk will focus on a particular middleware that enables dynamic resource usage by users embedded in a pervasive computing environment.  The middleware?s underlying computational model demonstrates how a rigorous formalization of a middleware?s operation can communicate the middleware?s behavior to application developers who employ it.  Finally, a set of applications that use the middleware exhibit its potential impact on real-world situations.</p>
<p>The talk will also provide an introduction to the Mobile and Pervasive Computing Group (MPC) within EDGE and give an overview of our current projects and research results.</p>

His workshop will focus on these topics, and there will be a computer lab where he will demonstrate how to use PAML to implement these models. I'll send around an exact schedule for the workshop when we have one.</p>
<p>His visit will be a short one, but he may have some time for individual meetings. If you have any questions, contact me (alverson@mail.utexas.edu) or Tracy Heath (tracyh@mail.utexas.edu).</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Fighting Deadly Diseases: Strategies for Prediction and Containment&quot;<br>
  Dr. Lauren A. Meyers, Section of Integrative Biology at UT-Austin<br>
  <strong>Friday, April 7, 7:00 PM CST</strong><br>
  Reception and activities 5:45 pm, come early and see the exhibits!<br>
  Welch Hall (WEL), Rm 2.224</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:  Are you concerned about the bird flu?  What would happen if a case appeared in the US?  Emerging global public health challenges like bird flu and SARS require innovative methods to understand and control the spread of new diseases.  Dr. Lauren A. Meyers will discuss how strategies for stopping the spread of deadly diseases can be developed by creating mathematical models of the transmission of diseases, using these models to predict the spread of disease, and assessing control strategies such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and vaccinations.  In 2004, Dr. Meyers was named one of the Top 100 Global Innovators under the age of 35 by the MIT Technology Review.  For more information, see the website posted below.</p>

  &quot;Is Hardware Innovation Over?&quot;<br>
  <strong>Monday, April 17, 2006 at 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. in ACES 2.302</strong><br>
  Host: Derek Chiou &amp; Co-Sponsor by the ECE Distinguished Lecture Series (http://www.ece.utexas.edu/faculty/seminar/distinguished_lecture_series.html)<br>
Refreshments: 4:45 p.m. in the ACES Connector Lobby</p>
<p>Talk Abstract:<br>
  Does the spread of multicore architectures mean the demise of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)? Power constrained, handheld devices may be one of the most important economic drivers for the semiconductor industry in the coming decades. Will the future cell phone functionality be delivered primarily through multi-core processors? Or will it be through reconfigurable FPGAs or a system composed of heterogeneous blocks? We will describe how it is possible to synthesize,quickly and efficiently, large and complex SoC's from a library of microarchitectural IP blocks, including embedded PowerPC models, DSPs and a variety of specialized hardware blocks (radios, MPEG4 decoders, ...). Our project, will provide, among other things, PowerPC 'gateware' for othersto use, and will shed light on how IP blocks should be written to be easily modifiable and reusable.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio:<br>
  Arvind is the Johnson Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT where he has been since 1979. In 1992, his group, in collaboration with Motorola, built the Monsoon dataflow machines and its associated software. A dozen of these machines were built and installed at Los Alamos National Labs and other universities, before Monsoon was retired to the Computer Museum in California.</p>
<p>In 2000, Arvind took a two-year leave of absence to start Sandburst, a fabless semiconductor company to produce a chip set for 10G-bit Ethernet routers. In 2003, Arvind co-founded Bluespec Inc., an EDA company to produce a set of tools for high-level synthesis. He currently serves on the board of both Sandburst and Bluespec.</p>
<p>In 2001, Dr. R. S. Nikhil and Arvind published the book &quot;Implicit parallel programming in pH&quot;. Arvind's current research interests are synthesis and verification of large digital systems described using Guarded Atomic Actions; and Memory Models and Cache Coherence Protocols for parallelarchitectures and languages.</p>
<p>The Computer Architecture Seminar Series is sponsored jointly by the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering and is supported by a grant from AMD.</p>

  Adversity Diversity and the Dynamicsand Evolution of Cellular Networks:<br>
from Natural to Synthetic Networks </p>
<p>In times of adversity or stress organisms are forced to adapt or evolve to survive. In either case, the population may diversify its response; nongenetically in the former case and by mutation in the latter. Diversification may be shown toasdfasdf be an optimal survival strategy in certain types of environments and with particular sensing capabilities. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms and cellular network designs that adapt an organism to its particular niche and which control population diversity across the different time scales of adaptation and evolution. Using comparative genomics, quantitative measurement, and dynamical modeling, we examine the evolution and dynamics ofbacterial signal transduction with detailed examples from B. subtilis stress response. We also discuss the implications of evolved networks designs for the engineering of synthetic ones by examining progress in the design of a tumor killing bacterium. </p>
<p>Dr. Arkin is Associate Professor of Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley; Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco; Faculty Scientist in the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and Director of the Virtual Institute for Microbial Stress and Survival. He is also an assistant investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then pursued postdoctoral studies at Stanford University in chemistry with John Ross and in developmental biology with Harley McAdams and Lucy Shapiro.</p>
