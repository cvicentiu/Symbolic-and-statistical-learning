        <p><font size="4">Neil Clark raises a lone voice for a
        man whose worst crime was to carry on being socialist - </font></p>
        <p>By Neil Clark </p>
        <p>I always remember my first visit to Belgrade, in the
        summer of 1998. As an unreconstructed socialist,
        completely out of step with the spirit of the age, I had
        spent most of the Nineties trying to escape, as best I
        could, to a place where it was still 1948. So imagine my
        delight when I arrived in Belgrade and found a city that
        seemed miraculously to have escaped all the horrors of
        global grunge. </p>
        <p>Bookshops, self-service restaurants and state-owned
        department stores abounded: a walk down the city
        boulevards reminded one of a British high street in the
        late Sixties. My delight turned to ecstasy when, on
        entering a state-owned bookshop, I saw on prominent
        display in the window a copy of that classic tome
        Arguments for Socialism by Tony Benn. What a truly
        wonderful place was Belgrade! Yet here I was, in the
        capital city of a nation commonly regarded as the
        'pariah' state of Europe and whose leader - a certain
        Slobodan Milosevic - was routinely dismissed in the
        western media as Europe's Saddam Hussein. Four years on,
        the same Slobodan Milosevic languishes in a cell awaiting
        trial on charges of war crimes and genocide. </p>
        <p>While opposition to the treatment of the al-Qaeda
        prisoners has been widespread and vociferous, few have
        protested about the treatment handed out to a man who,
        less than 18 months ago, was president of a European
        nation. Yet the way Milosevic has been dealt with is, in
        many ways, as great a scandal as the blindfolds and
        handcuffs at Camp X-Ray. </p>
        <p>For a start, it is still unclear what the former
        Yugoslav leader is actually charged with, even though he
        has been deprived of his liberty for more than ten months
        now. The original war crimes indictment, served on
        Milosevic in June 1999 at the height of the Kosovo war,
        covered vague charges relating to the war in Kosovo. The
        UN's chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, has
        sought to submerge these charges into a 'unified'
        indictment, widened to include charges relating to the
        war in Bosnia and also to campaigns in Croatia. At least,
        that was the position up until very recently. Now, it
        seems, due to problems with 'collecting evidence', the
        trial date of 12 February is likely to be put back once
        more. </p>
        <p>As if the nebulous nature of these charges were not
        scandalous enough, there are also the day-to-day
        infringements of Milosevic's basic human rights to
        consider. On the pretext of preventing a suicide attempt,
        Milosevic is under 24-hour video surveillance in his cell.
        He is denied access to the counsel of his choice, his
        mail is strictly censored and he is prevented from
        speaking to the world's media. Yet despite these
        violations, Amnesty International, normally so vocal in
        its defence of 'political prisoners', has yet to utter so
        much as a murmur. </p>
        <p>The problem is that the demonisation campaign against
        Milosevic has been so thorough and unrelenting and, for
        most, Slobo is already guilty as charged. Milosevic, we
        have learnt from the western media, is a rabid Serb
        nationalist who whipped up dormant ethnic tensions to
        plunge the whole region into war and, in the process, had
        thousands of innocent people deported or killed. </p>
        <p>But let us look beyond this CNN view of world history.
        Slobodan Milosevic, a lifelong socialist, never once made
        a racist speech. When faced with the incessant violence
        of western-trained separatist groups, he had little
        option but to use military means to try to prevent the
        break-up of his country and to defend the Serbian and
        Roma people from being driven out of the lands they had
        inhabited for centuries. </p>
        <p>Ironically, although the Yugoslav Socialist Party
        leader had no shortage of 'right-wing' enemies (Lady
        Thatcher, for one), it has been representatives of the
        liberal left, in the United States, Britain and Europe,
        who have hounded him most mercilessly. </p>
        <p>Back in 1999, it was Auberon Waugh who memorably
        coined the phrase 'Blair-Toynbee axis' to describe the
        unedifying enthusiasm for the bombing of Yugoslavia from
        new Labour and its supporters in the British media. Then
        ministers such as Robin Cook and Derek Fatchett who, less
        than 20 years earlier, had been on Ban the Bomb marches
        now climbed into jump jets and addressed military press
        conferences, while Clare Short defended the killing of
        cleaners and make-up girls at the Yugoslav state
        television station by Nato bombs. </p>
        <p>How are we to explain this? The trouble with Slobo is
        not that he is an 'ethnic cleanser' (three years after
        the original indictment, we have yet to see the evidence
        linking Milosevic to atrocities in Bosnia), but that he
        is stubbornly and cussedly an 'old', unreconstructed
        socialist. This is why the new designer 'left' parties of
        Europe have pursued him so mercilessly to The Hague.
        Slobo is exactly the kind of old-style eastern European
        leader many of them would have defended in their student
        days. Ironically, it is still acceptable in politically
        correct circles to praise Tito's Yugoslavia, which was
        truly a one-party state; but Milosevic's Yugoslavia,
        where more than 20 political parties could freely
        operate, is deemed completely beyond the pale. </p>
        <p>Had Milosevic sold off his country's assets to the
        multinationals and queued up deferentially to join the
        European Union and Nato, and become a western 'yes-man',
        he would have had carte blanche to wage his own 'war
        against terrorism'. Anyone who doubts this need only
        refer to the 1999 US-EU Balkan Stability Pact, which
        called for all countries of the region to be offered Nato
        and EU membership to 'anchor them firmly in Euro-Atlantic
        structures', as well as demanding 'widespread
        privatisation' and an end to any restrictions on the
        operations of multinationals. </p>
        <p>The treatment handed out to Milosevic shows that the
        biggest enemies of socialist causes are not those with
        principles on the right, but those without them on the
        left. </p>
