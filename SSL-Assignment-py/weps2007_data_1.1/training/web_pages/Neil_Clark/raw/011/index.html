      <p>
      The Times, the oldest newspaper in the country, has long been regarded as a paper of record. Lies and misinformation in other newspapers should of course be rigorously challenged, but in the Times when a writer puts forward information which he or she either knows is false, or has no evidence to back up the assertion, it is arguably  even more serious, given the paper's historical reputation. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.stephenpollard.net/003141.html">Stephen Pollard </a>has done that today. <br /><br />In his <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article1375237.ece">bitter tirade </a>against members of the British Jewish community who don't share his opinions, he twice referred to the late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a 'genocidal butcher'.<br /><br />Pollard has been asked to provide evidence to back up this claim on several occasions before and has failed to do so.<br />He needs to be held to account.<br /><br />If like me, you feel strongly about this matter you can contact The Times editor, Robert Thomson either by email at editor@thetimes.co.uk, or at 1, Pennington Street, London E88 ITT. <br />The Times comment editor, Daniel Finkelstein can also be contacted at that address and by email at daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk<br />You can also send a letter to letters@thetimes.co.uk.<br />(If you'd like to contact Pollard directly to ask him about his sources, then his email address is stephen.pollard@cne.org)<br /><br />Pollard must either produce evidence to show that Milosevic was a 'genocidal butcher',(Milosevic's four-year trial at The Hague certainly didn't come up with any)or else desist from making the claim in a public arena.<br /><br />And unless Pollard can back up his allegation, The Times should print a retraction to say that their writer's claim was without foundation.

        <p>You're wasting your time advising people to write in to Finklestein, Neil. He Kamm and Pollard are all part of the same smug, mutually adoring let's lick-each-others arses neo-con gang who will be holding each others hands as they lead us all to Armageddon.<BR/>But writing in to The Times editor is a good suggestion which I hope many people will do. Of course, he'll be a Murdoch man and generally supportive of the pro-war line, but I did notice recently how Times sales have been dropping off badly and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks Finkelstein has just gone a little bit too far with the shameless promotion of his little pals.</p>

        <p>To make matters worse a new law has been proposed at the EU to punish genocide denial throughout the continent for three years. This genocide denial would include the war in the Balkans. If it is so obvious and demonstrable that genocide occurred such laws shouldn't be needed. Therefore we can conclude that the motivation is to crush dissent. The EU needs an American First Amendment.</p>

        <p>Last night on BBC Channel 4 we saw how that nice person Mr. Nice did his job so nicely and got a very nice knighthood for it. I have never seen a judge (Robinson) turn and say to the accused "I am disgusted with you". He constantly turned off Milosevic's microphone. He interrupted his line of questioning when he felt like it. It gave a true picture of the Hague and what an appalling place it is. It is clear that they make the rules up as they go along. <BR/><BR/>Far from proving the case they showed themselves as completely incompetent. Four long years and nothing. They had to add indictments (illegal as far as I know) after he was in detention because they didn't have anything to frame him on. <BR/><BR/>Hey but that nice Mr. Nice or should I say Lord Nice was happy with the outcome. Good thing Milosevic died with the help of the Hague inquisitors because nice Mr/Lord Nice couldn't see an end to it. <BR/><BR/>Total propaganda. Total rubbish. Those of you who think like Patrick should watch the programme again and this time concentrate!</p>

        <p>Lets see now...kosavas killed in Kosovo, rounded up, executed, buried, dug up and found in a river in Serbia.<BR/><BR/>Orders given in code in telephone conversations between high ranking Milosevic aids and himself.<BR/><BR/>The list goes on, esp his links with the scorpians BUT its is pointless as you are living in a Paragram, for you the truth is some how negotiable.<BR/><BR/>This is what the truth is, Milosevic and the rest of the National Socialist Serbian elite, used systematic killing to drive fear into other ethnic groups, so they fled (3 million did) and gave up territory to serbs. (Yes the Serbs suffered too, But that does not excuse the use of genocide to drive out and/or kill an ethnic group)<BR/><BR/>War is when one side or both, seeks to conquer or submit to its will by the use of force, this was not war.<BR/>This was not the political intentions of the National Socialist Serbs. This was the use of fear thru murder, and its very scale says that by objective truth it is inconceivable that it was not orchestrated with direct or indirect orders from belgrade.<BR/><BR/>Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."<BR/>Contents<BR/><BR/><BR/>Guilty as charged.</p>

        <p>The indictment was not split!!<BR/><BR/>SO come on put your real cards on the table. what are you saying?<BR/><BR/>Are you saying Milosevic was not guilty as there was NO genocide?<BR/><BR/>Or there was a Genocide as Milosevic had nothing to do with it?<BR/><BR/>1, Fact 1, There was a genocide, here it is again "Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;" <BR/><BR/>(and No I am not bothered what the post-modernist, Neo-Marxists have to say at the Observer, and No I don't buy any newspaper before you start!)<BR/><BR/>I have served on a jury, and I have acquitted, I know what you are looking for when looking for truth.<BR/>You are looking for the story that best explains the facts (btw Facts are value-free, just like science should be) <BR/><BR/>You are not going to get a piece of paper or a video with Milosevic brandishing a gun or signing a piece of paper saying, "Go and kill as many Kosovan Muslims as you need to frighten the others away", and even If you did you would not accept it (and neither would I, as it would probably be fabricated)<BR/><BR/>SO fact 2, It was planned (intercepts and evidence in court, best explains the language used on those intercepts)<BR/><BR/>SO who has the capacity to plan? the arms, the means, the logistics, the timing?  the place? a few paramilitary,s on a bender? a few bent angry police men? or locals wanting a few extra fields from their neighbours?<BR/><BR/>I think the diary of the chief of security gave the game away. It was planned in Milosevic,s office. So if it was planned there don't you think he would have known about it? and if it was a few renegades, he would have acted to stop them?<BR/><BR/>Its called Linear thinking! and that leads to the only conclusion. GUILTY.<BR/><BR/>My grandfather was one of the first troops to reach Bergen Belsen concentration camp.He paid for it all the rest of his life, in alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling addiction, family breakdown and night terrors. I promised him that I would not turn my face to evil (thats if you can believe in evil in your post-modernist pinter world)...you should learn to do the same.<BR/><BR/>I pity you.</p>

I am an anti-fascist/anti-Nazi freelance writer and researcher who is half Jewish (on my mother's side).My mother's entire family was murdered by European Nazis during WW2.My mother was almost starved to death in a WW2 Nazi concentration camp.<BR/><BR/>I have studied the Yugoslav conflict quite extensively for nearly 16 years as well as WW2 history of Yugoslavia and have reams of documented evidence in my possession relating to the key political players in the lead up to the outbreak of war in June 1991 both in Yugoslavia and the West.<BR/><BR/>Based on my own independent research and original documentation I have viewed over the last 16 years, I have no hesitation in saying that the REAL war criminals are Western politicians like Kohl, Genscher, Schroeder, Kinkel, Fischer, Ruehe, Blair,Cook,Short,Robertson,Solana,<BR/>Chirac,Clinton,Albright,Berger,<BR/>Clark,Holbrooke et al, whom supported the REAL genocidal Balkan Nazis: <BR/><BR/>People like Tudjman,Izetbegovic, and the fascist heroin drug running, child sex slavery racketeering KLA thugs of Thaci,Ceku,Haradinaj and Demaci: people proud of their Nazi and fascist beliefs and backgrounds; people who had no qualms about putting into print their PUBLIC admiration of the genocidal policies of Adolf Hitler, Hajj Amin al Husseini and Ante Pavelic years before the outbreak of war in June 1991.<BR/><BR/><BR/>For a background on Franjo Tudjman and his resurrection of the WW2 Croatian genocidal Ustasha responsible for the murders of between 750,000 to 1.2 million Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, see below:<BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/licnosti/tudjman.2.html" REL="nofollow"> Hiding Genocide:Croatia has resumed its "liquidation" of Serbs, while arguing that "ethnic cleansing" is a Serbian creation...</A> <BR/><BR/>and <BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://128.121.186.47/ISSA/reports/Balkan/Dec3192-2.htm" REL="nofollow">For Serbians, Fears of a German Axis Rise For The Third Time This Century</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://128.121.186.47/ISSA/reports/Balkan/Jan3193.htm" REL="nofollow">Croatia,at a Key Strategic Crossroad, Builds Militarily and Geographically</A><BR/><BR/><BR/>The BBC, over the last 17 years, has covered up all of these Balkan Nazis' specific intentions to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing PRIOR to the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia in June 1991. The BBC instead of appraising the public of the facts, deliberately and sytematically LIED through their teeth about Milosevic's  specifically tolerant and pro-multi-ethnic, pro-multicultural speech at the "Field Of the Blackbirds" in June 1989.<BR/><BR/><BR/>Naturally of the above being done to cover up Germany's role in instigating the war back in <B>1988</B> when Chancellor Kohl secretly met with Tudjman to discuss a plan on forcefully breaking up the then existing Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.<BR/><BR/>See <A HREF="http://emperor.vwh.net/articles/carr/carr2.htm" REL="nofollow">T.W.

Based on documented evidence available in the public domain over the last 20 years, it is now clear that the BBC cannot be trusted to tell the truth. In many ways the BBC has proven itself to be an establishment propaganda instrument.<BR/><BR/>When the BBC seeks to justify a particular establishment foreign policy, they never provide documented PROOF for anything they claim: only Goebbels style "Big Lie" assertions and fabricated "evidence".<BR/><BR/>They also utilize the well worn adversarial propaganda trick known as "false opposition" whereby they feign opposition to a particular establishment foreign policy (eg., as in the case of the Iraq war and the WMD red herring)but in actuality are promoting the position and real goals of the establishment foreign policy elite. <BR/><BR/>The BBC has a reputation for brazenly lying through its teeth about virtually everything except perhaps the weather and sporting results.<BR/><BR/><BR/>If Milosevic was such a "genocidal butcher" there wouuld have been ZERO need for the BBC,ITN,ABC,SBS,CNN,CBC,CBS,NBC and the rest of the Western media to deliberately LIE about his speech by ludicrously claiming that he was "inciting and whipping up Serbs into a nationalist frenzy".<BR/><BR/>See <A HREF="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/milospeech.htm" REL="nofollow">How Politicians, the Media, and Scholars Lied about Milosevic's 1989 Kosovo Speech:<BR/>A review of the evidence<BR/></A><BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/guide-yugo.htm" REL="nofollow">Historical & Investigate Research: Articles on the civil wars in the<BR/>former Yugoslavia</A><BR/><BR/>The late Alija Izetbegovic, former illegtimate "president" of Bosnia Herzegovina,illegal ursuper of power in 1990 from the duly elected Bosnian muslim leader, Mr.Fikret Abdic ,is the one behind the death camp fraud (he admitted it on his death bed) along with a multi-million dollar funded American "public relations" & lobbying firm (i.e. Ruder Finn - who also worked as a lobbying group in Washington on behalf of the Islamist Nazi terrorist KLA and Tudjman's HDZ Fascist neo-Ustasha racist government). <BR/><BR/>Izetbegovic, the man described by ITN,BBC,CNN,the Guardian et al, as a:<BR/><BR/><B><I>"secular muslim and moderate democrat committed to a multi-ethnic Western style liberal democracy"</B></I> <A HREF="http://www.real-srebrenica-genocide.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow">was in fact committed to genocide of all non-muslims.</A><BR/><BR/>Well before the outbreak of war in 1992, Izetbegovic PUBLICLY announced his commitment to genocide by having his version of Hitler's Mein Kampf (his 1970 manifesto, "The Islamic Declaration": <B><A HREF="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/ihralija1.htm" REL="nofollow">a call for Jihad and the extermination of non-Muslims</A>, re-published in 1990 as part of his election campaign</B>).<BR/><BR/><I>"Izetbegovic appointed  the Muslim National Council (MNC) of Bosnia to achieve long-term aspirations, to create a Muslim state in the Balkans.

The purpose of Islam is to establish the state based on its ideology and program, no matter which nation becomes the bearer of Islam or which nation is undermined in the process of establishing the ideological Islamic state” [ibid].</B></I><BR/><BR/><BR/>See: <A HREF="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/ihralija1.htm" REL="nofollow">Who was Alija Izetbegovic: Moderate democrat or radical Islamist?</A><BR/><BR/>and <BR/><A HREF="http://128.121.186.47/ISSA/reports/Balkan/Dec0803.htm" REL="nofollow">Alija Izetbegovic: A Retrospective Look at His Impact on Balkan Stability</A><BR/><BR/><BR/>For photographs of Izetbegovic's massacres (perpetrated by his Islamist Nazi "tough guy", Naser Oric: given a "harsh" <B>2 year sentence</B> by NATO's Hague ICTY and RELEASED!) in the towns and villages of  Srebrenica, Bratunac,Skelani,Milici, Kravica, Gorazde et al, see: <A HREF="http://www.real-srebrenica-genocide.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow"> The Real Srebrenica Genocide </A><BR/><BR/><BR/>Of course, the Gaurdian and BBC <B><I>knew</B></I> that <A HREF="http://www.real-srebrenica-genocide.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow">Izetbegovic was a Nazi</A> as early as 1983 when he was jailed for his Islamist attempted terrorist activities,  but deliberately censored the truth about his WW2 Nazi background and genocidal Nazi beliefs which he reiterated <B><I>publicly</B></I> in a shuttle tour of fundamentalist Islamist terrorist states in the Middle East during 1991 (especially his visit to Tehran where he agreed with the Ayatollah Khomeini that Salman Rushdie deserved the death sentence for writing "the Satanic Verses").<BR/>ITN reporters went to Bosnia in 1992 in search of "concentration camps held by the Serbs" after American reporter, Roy Gutman, of New York's "Newsday" paper made a sensational claim - with no independent proof whatsoever - (other than Izetbegvic SDA government press releases)that the Bosnian Serbs were running "death camps".<BR/><BR/>Pity ITN didn't do so in 1991 when there were already <B><I>real</B></I> death camps set up at the Borovo footware factory and the "Rowing Club" in Vukovar, Croatia: at least 1,000 Serbian civilians -including women,children & the elderly - were beheaded and dismembered in a two month period in late 1991 by Tudjman's neo-Ustasha Nazi "Black Legion" troops (Croat version of the SS) with many more thousands of Serbs being murdered and half a million expelled from late 1991 to late 1995.

        <p>ben, patrick and gaz don't provide a single witness<BR/>from the ICTY to prove their hilariously ridiculous<BR/>arguments. <BR/><BR/>Take Ben for example. He compares the Bosnian Civil<BR/>War with the Holocaust.<BR/><BR/>Hmmmmmm ! Ben ole sort, you are aware that the civil war took 100,000 lives.<BR/><BR/>Croat, Muslim, Serb, military and civilian. <BR/><BR/>That's right , 100,000 on all sides.<BR/><BR/>100,000 in total.<BR/><BR/>Yet you are happy to compare this with the Holocaust.<BR/><BR/>You're not a Holocaust revisionist are you? The reason I ask is you're oh so happy to belittle the plight of the Jews in WW2.<BR/><BR/>I think we should be told</p>

        <p>LOL, gaz, your evidence that genocide existed is that it has a legal definition and that Milosevic had tha capacity! You couldn't make this stuff up!<BR/><BR/>The fact is that since 1999 NATO could not prove one shred of evidence of a genocide and the numerous forensic investigations of alleged mass grave sites have unearthed around 3000 bodies of all nationalities that died in various ways. Also the late Daniel Pearl in his article in the LA Times on Dec. 31st debunked many NATO war propaganda ploys.</p>

I am a regular contributor to The Guardian, The Australian, New Statesman, The Spectator, The First Post, R.F.O. and  Daily Express. My work has also appeared in The Fleet Street Letter, Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Times and in publications as diverse as The American Conservative, Pravda, The Morning Star and The Racing Post. 
I am strongly opposed to the neo-conservative war agenda -
and believe in the urgent necessity of a left-right anti-war coalition.
The choice facing us is stark: More Shock and Awe- against Syria, Iran or Belarus, or any other country which refuses to pay Danegeld to The Empire- or lasting peace and security- based on respect for the sovereignty of nations. It's time to make our stand. On domestic issues I support renationalisation of the railways and public utilities, a new top rate of income tax on the very wealthy, free care for the elderly, a free National Health Service including the restoration of NHS dentistry, protection of the Green Belt and the countryside, and the restoration of capital punishment. </p>  <p class="profile-link"> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10479041156190090119">View my complete profile</a> </p> </div>
