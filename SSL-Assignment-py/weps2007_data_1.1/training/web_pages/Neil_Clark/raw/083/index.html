<h3 class="title"> Neil Clark, who, I</h3>
	
	 
<p><br />
  <img align="left" src="n.gif">
 eil Clark, who, I am led to understand, is both British and "a fierce critic of US foreign policy," has <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2002-09-07&id=2221">a piece in The Spectator bashing British anti-Americanism</a>.  When I first saw this article I thought it was a great idea; however, reading it, I found it to be profoundly misguided.</p>

<blockquote><p>‘I am 25, a graduate who has traveled extensively after university and a Labour voter. To people of my type, across Europe and the English-speaking world, Americans are a laughing-stock, known mainly for their vacuous culture and profound ignorance. We all have a “dumb Yank” story on our travels. This is why Americans are so hated by us on the Left, however much we condemn the outrages.’ Such were the thoughts of Thomas Smith of Bristol, in a letter to the Daily Telegraph not long after the events of 11 September. 

<p>It would be nice to think that Smith’s views are just the unrepresentative opinions of a rather arrogant and puffed-up young man. Yet sadly, he is probably right when he talks about how people of his ‘type’ see Americans. </p>

<p>Although Smith’s assertions, thankfully, did not go unchallenged by American readers of the Telegraph, one can only wonder what greater commotion would have been caused had our young Bristolian used the term ‘dumb’ to describe, for example, Nigerians or Pakistanis instead of Americans. If he had done so, he would probably have been visited by officers of the Commission for Racial Equality, and all prospects of a glittering postgraduate career would have been nipped in the bud.</blockquote></p>

<p>What sort of Britain is this, where you can't make fun of foreigners?  I have spent a considerable amount of time on that scepter'd isle, and it took me all of two seconds to realize that xenophobia is the national pastime.  I can't help but think that this is a healthy thing.  It's like my mother always used to say: 'If you can't laugh at yourself, who can you laugh it?"  She never answered this question, of course, because it was a <i>rhetorical question</i>, which is a question you don't expect an answer to because you've passed out stone drunk on the kitchen floor after asking it.  (Other rhetorical questions my mother asked me: "What's your damned name?"  "What did you do with my St. Ides, you &*%$#?" and "Why did God curse me with this worthless child?"  Ah, memories...)  But I realized at an early age that the answer was "foreigners."  Foreigners are inherently funny.  Look:<br />
</p><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Belgians</li><br />
<li>Taiwanese</li><br />
<li>Canadians</li><br />
<li>Russians</li><br />
<li>Libyans</li><br />
</ul><br />
<P><br />
Come on, admit it - they're funny.  And yet, with the exception of Canada, all of these countries are full of perfectly decent human beings just like you and me.  But they are figures of fun nonetheless, because they do ridiculous things such as:<br />
</P><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Dress unfashionably</li><br />
<li>Speak some stupid language, or, even worse, speak English with a strange accent and with stupid words added</li><br />
<li>Don't know anything about your country, and those things they do know are completely wrong</li><br />
<li>Lose wars</li><br />
<li>Elect horrible fools, or are ruled by fools they aren't even allowed to elect</li><br />
<li>Eat disgusting things</li><br />
<li>Come from other countries</li><br />
<li>Be foreign and stupid</li><br />
</ul><br />
<P>A bottomless well of material for ridicule.  Look: I understand that it is not nice to say most of these things, particularly not to foreigners.  I understand too that it is often advisable to pretend that these things aren't funny, that they are just rude, and that people from other countries are magical treasures that are to be admired and adored for their glorious differences which add to the bright mosaic of cultures and experiences that make the world a beautiful place, usually while contemplatively sipping herbal tea.  What a horrible load of crap.  Deep down, you know it's funny.  You know it.</p>

<p>Now, in the topsy-turvy Bizarro World of Great Britain, it turns out, through a series of counter-intuitive reversals and switch-a-roos which I have never been able to sort out satisfactorily, Americans are considered "foreigners".  It's true.  Therefore, in a subverting of the natural order of things, Americans are disparaged for doing things differently.  Americans are laughed at for wearing Jansport backpacks, and not knowing which tube to take to get to Lorryton-on-the-Glen, and for not drinking 47 pints of Olde Rancid Bollocks Bitter every Tuesday evening, and for spelling "program" instead of "programmmme" and for spelling "zoo" instead of "soo", and so on.  And yet, somehow, this <i>is</i> the natural order of things, just kind of switched around.  It's weird, but it works.  The British, like everyone on the planet, know this.  However, and much to their credit, they generally take the additional step of acknowledging this fact.  This deeply healthy psychology is what allows the British to live past the age of 26, despite surviving on a diet of nothing but beer, marmite, and hand-rolled cigarettes.</p>

<p>But it doesn't end there.  The British further understand that <i>foreigners are funny in inverse relation to how different they are from you</i>.  So people from Nepal are only slightly, but the Germans are hilarious.  And if you think the Germans are funny, that's nothing compared to people from Liverpool, who, in turn, can't hold a candle to the people who live two blocks from you.  This is because each British person has realized that they personally are the biggest idiot on the planet, a fact that holds true for every person of whatever nationality on the great globe of bottomless idiocy.  It is this preternaturally healthy attitude which allows many British to survive past the age of 3, despite the fact that the Sun's trajectory does not pass over Britain at any point.</p>

<p>So naturally, the proper response to Mr. Smith was not to become indignant.  The proper response was to point out that Mr. Smith was from <i>Bristol</i>, and so was clearly an illiterate, alcoholic, mustachioed Bristolian fool, and that The Telegraph should know better to distribute to that absurd and backwards city, when it is common knowledge that everyone there is too stupid to figure out how to wrap fish with it.  If there weren't two thousand letters to this effect, but even more contemptuous, fired off from around the United Kingdom for each one lamely trying to defend Americans, then it is a dark day for Old Blighty.</p>

<p>Continuing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moving on to the dreary ‘Dumb Yanks’ jibe, I write as one who has taught both American and British students for more than ten years. While it is true that knowledge of European geography is not usually the American student’s strong point, once again, one can’t really press this too hard when only 8 per cent of our own schoolchildren have heard of Winston Churchill and 12 per cent believe Tony Blair to be a football player. And while we castigate Americans for their ignorance of Europe, how many Britons can name the capital of Nebraska, or know which states border Iowa? </blockquote>

<p>Let's ignore the obvious question of how many people from Lincoln, Nebraska can name the capital of Nebraska, and the further question of who on God's Green Earth gives two green shits what states border Iowa.  What Mr. Clark is trying to show here is that the British are just as stupid as Americans, an argument I take patriotic offense to.  Remember what I said just now about everyone everywhere being equally stupid?  Forget it.  <b>America has the World's greatest stupid people</b>.  Listen: you can Richard Feynman and Ben Franklin me all day long, and you can show me interviews with David Beckham and George Michael until the Sun burns out, but if I turn on the TV at 10AM and show you one episode of "the Jerry Springer Show", what are you going to do then?  Huh?  What?  Silence?  That's what I thought.  And Jerry does it every day of the week.  You'd have to do casting calls in Britain for a month to get one show that matches Springer.  Stupid Americans are the stupidest people on Earth.  Love it or leave it.  The last thing I need to hear is some arrogant Englishman telling me that his stupid people are as good as mine.  Buddy, they had to <i>dumb down</i> "The Weakest Link' when they brought it over here.  Think about that for a while.</p>

<p>Look, the kind of anti-Americanism that Mr. Clark is all upset about is harmless.  The British hate everyone, and, frankly, they've got the right idea.  The kind of anti-Americanism which<i> isn't</i> harmless is the kind which gets tangled up in politics.  When Chirac and friends go to Johannesburg and complain about how America isn't doing enough to help the poor countries of the World, and uses this as a smokescreen to cover their refusal to cut domestic farm subsidies, that's harmful anti-Americanism.  When protestors boo Powell, but let Robert Mugabe, whose ban on American GM rice (to name but one on the endless list of his profoundly rapacious and/or idiotic policies) helps condemn 6 million Zimbabweans to starvation, that is harmful.  And, of course, when governments try to deflect their people's anger away from themselves by inventing fairy stories about how the Jews control America, that is harmful anti-Americanism, and harmful anti-Semitism, too.  Mr. Clark's gesture is appreciated, but unnecessary.  We can take it.  We can even, when the occasion arises, dish it out.  Cheers, though.</p>
