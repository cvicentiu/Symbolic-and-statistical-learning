<h1>Never mind the Balkans</h1><h3>by Neil Clark</h3><h3>23 May 2006</h3><hr>
<P>'Montenegro votes for independence", the headlines declared at the result of the referendum in the Balkan republic. But is independence really what lies in store? My dictionary has independence as: "completely self-governing; not subject to or showing the influence of others". By this definition, independence is not what they will be getting.
<P>The most important political and economic decisions, which will affect the everyday lives of citizens in the republic, will not be made in its capital, Podgorica, but in Brussels, Geneva and Washington and the boardrooms of the multinational companies which now dominate the country's economy.
<P>It is ironic that EU and WTO membership has been most enthusiastically supported by the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, and the pro-independence faction &ndash; for it's hard to think of an easier way for a small country to lose national independence than by surrendering control of trade and economic policy to unelected bureaucrats miles away.
<P>Nato membership, which Montenegro is also expected to pursue enthusiastically, has similar consequences: the commanders of Montenegro's new army and navy will have to get used to taking orders from those who planned the 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.
<P>Then there is the role of the IMF and the World Bank. These two unelected bodies have, with the EU, sought to impose Thatcherite neo-liberal solutions on Serbia-Montenegro, ever since the fall of Yugoslavia's Socialist-led government in 2000. Thousands of socially owned enterprises have already been privatised, but the west is still not satisfied &ndash; the IMF has made further economic help dependent on Belgrade selling off the valuable NIS oil company.
<P>Montenegro's tiny economy is even more dominated by foreign capital than Serbia's, with the privatisation process having started much earlier. The selling off of nationally owned assets will have serious implications for the country's future economic viability and even with the tourist potential of its attractive coastline, it is difficult to see how Montenegro can afford to pay its way, without further surrender to western financial institutions. In doing so, it will be following the path of its neighbours.
<P>For all the novelties of statehood, the brutal truth is that today's "independent" Balkan republics had, if anything, more independence when they were autonomous republics inside the Yugoslav Federation. In place of one militarily strong, internationally respected, non-aligned nation, there now exists a number of weak, economically unviable EU/IMF/Nato protectorates.
<P>The dismantling of Yugoslavia, with its alternative economic and social model, has suited western capitalism fine. But for the people of the region, the benefits have been harder to discern. Little wonder then that nostalgia for Tito's Yugoslavia is on the rise. The website "Titoville" has received over 1m visitors and in Rakovice, a suburb of Sarajevo, an anti-nationalist Serb named Jezdimir Milosevic (no relation) has proclaimed "The Republic of Titoslavia", a state "without territory, without international recognition, destined to live in the hearts of its citizens". Passports are available for &euro;10.
<P>Over 65 years ago, on the eve of the attack on Yugoslavia by the Axis powers, the Serbian jurist Slobodan Jovanovic argued that a single, south Slav state was the best way the people of the Balkans could guarantee their independence and protection. It still is &ndash; and that logic seems likely to make itself felt in the years to come. When the victory parades are over, the only real difference Sunday's narrow vote will make is that Montenegro will be able enter Eurovision.
