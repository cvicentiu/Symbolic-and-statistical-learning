<h1>The quisling of Belgrade</h1>
<h2>By Neil Clark, <cite>The Guardian</cite>, Friday 14 March
2003</h2> 
<h3>The murdered Serbian prime minister was a reviled western stooge
whose economic reforms brought misery</h3>
<p>
Tributes to Zoran Djindjic, the assassinated prime minister of Serbia,
have been pouring in. President Bush led the way, praising his
&#8220;strong leadership&#8221;, while the Canadian government&#39;s
spokesman extolled a &#8220;heralder of democracy&#8221; and Tony
Blair spoke of the energy Djindjic had devoted to &#8220;reforming
Serbia&#8221;.
</p><p>
In western newspaper obituaries Djindjic has been almost universally
acclaimed as an ex-student agititator who bravely led a popular
uprising against a tyrannical dictator and endeavoured to steer his
country into a new democratic era.
</p><p>
But beyond the CNN version of world history, the career of Zoran
Djindjic looks rather different. Those who rail against the doctrine
of regime change should remember that Iraq is far from being the first
country where the US and other western governments have tried to
engineer the removal of a government that did not suit their strategic
interests. Three years ago it was the turn of Slobodan Milosevic&#39;s
Yugoslavia.
</p><p>
In his recent biography of Milosevic, Adam LeBor reveals how the US
poured $70m into the coffers of the Serb opposition in its efforts to
oust the Yugoslav leader in 2000. On the orders of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, a covert US Office of Yugoslav Affairs was set up
to help organise the uprising that would sweep the autocratic
Milosevic from power.
</p><p>
At the same time, there is evidence that underworld groups, controlled
by Zoran Djindjic and linked to US intelligence, carried out a series
of assassinations of key supporters of the Milosevic regime, including
Defence Minister Pavle Bulatovic and Zika Petrovic, head of Yugoslav
Airlines.
</p><p>
With Slobo and his socialist party finally toppled, the US got the
&#8220;reforming&#8221; government in Belgrade it desired. The new
President Vojislav Kostunica received the bouquets, but it was the
State Department&#39;s man, Zoran Djindjic, who held the levers of
power&#8212;and he certainly did not let his Washington sponsors down.
</p><p>
The first priority was to embark on a programme of &#8220;economic
reform&#8221; - new-world-order-speak for the selling of state assets
at knockdown prices to western multinationals. Over 700,000 Yugoslav
enterprises remained in social ownership and most were still
controlled by employee-management committees, with only 5% of capital
privately owned. Companies could only be sold if 60% of the shares
were allocated to workers.
</p><p>
Djindjic moved swiftly to change the law and the great sell-off could
now begin. After two years in which thousands of socially owned
enterprises have been sold (many to companies from countries which
took part in the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia), last month&#39;s World
Bank report was lavish in its praise of the Djindjic government and
its &#8220;engagement of international banks in the privatisation
process&#8221;.
</p><p>
But it wasn&#8217;t just state assets that Djindjic was under orders
to sell.  Milosevic had to go too, for a promised $100m, even if it
effectively meant kidnapping him in contravention of Yugoslav law, and
sending him by RAF jet to a US-financed show trial at the Hague. When
a man has sold his country&#39;s assets, its ex-president and his main
political rivals, what else is there to sell? Only the country
itself. And in January this year Djindjic did just that. Despite the
opposition of most of its citizens, the &#8220;heralder of
democracy&#8221; followed the requirements of the &#8220;international
community&#8221; and after 74 years the name of Yugoslavia disappeared
off the political map. The strategic goal of its replacement with a
series of weak and divided protectorates had finally been achieved.
</p><p>
Sometimes, though, even the best executed plans go awry. Despite the
western eulogies, Djindjic will be mourned by few in Serbia. For the
great majority of Serbs, he will be remembered as a quisling who
enriched himself by selling his country to those who had waged war
against it so mercilessly onl y a few years earlier. Djindjic&#39;s
much lauded reforms have led to soaring utility prices, unemployment
has risen sharply to over 30%, real wages have fallen by up to 20% and
over two-thirds of Serbs now live below the poverty line.
</p><p>
It is still unclear who fired the shots that killed Zoran
Djindjic. The likelihood is that it was an underworld operation, his
links to organised crime finally catching up with him. But, harsh
though it sounds, there are many in Serbia who would willingly have
pulled the trigger. On a recent visit to Belgrade, I was struck not
only by the level of economic hardship, but by the hatred almost
everyone I met felt towards their prime minister, whose poll ratings
had fallen below 10%.
</p><p>
The lesson from Serbia for today&#39;s serial regime changers is a
simple one.  You can try to subjugate a people by sanctions,
subversion and bombs. You can, if you wish, overthrow governments you
dislike and seek to impose your will by installing a Hamid Karzai,
General Tommy Franks or a Zoran Djindjic to act as imperial
consul. But do not imagine that you can then force a humiliated people
to pay homage to them.
