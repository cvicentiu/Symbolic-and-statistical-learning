<p>Oh well, someone has to do it ...</p>

<p>Suggesting as <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/neil_clark/2006/03/ten_questions_on_slobodan_milo.html">Neil Clark does on this site today</a> that Slobodan Milosevic had little or nothing to do with the war crimes and mass bloodshed carried out in the former Yugoslavia during his time at the helm of Serbia is akin to suggesting Hitler had no responsibility for the invasion of Poland and what followed.</p>

<p>Like most malicious historical revisionism Clark's apologia barely merits a rebuttal but for those interested in the facts, as opposed to his ludicrous fiction,  I suggest two sources.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the website of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> and, in particular, the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm">amended indictment</a> against Milosevic and his close associates.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend a read of British journalist <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dblended%26field-keywords%3Dadam%252520lebor%252520milosevic/026-3432902-3233269">Adam Lebor's biography of Milosevic</a>.</p>

<p>From that book one can quickly discover how inaccurate Clark is. </p>

<p>Here is Clark:<p><blockquote>Milosevic, the inciter of ancient ethnic hatred at Kosovo Polje? All you have to do is to read the English translation of the speech. "More and more successfully citizens of different nationalities, different faiths and races are living together. Socialism, in particular, being a progressive and just democratic society, should not allow people to be divided by national or religious identity" - if that's a Serb nationalist rant then my name is Jose Mourinho.</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
Nice rhetorical sentiments from Slobo, but Clark could have, and chose not to, quote Milosevic promising the Serbian crowd: "No one should dare beat you again," and then this section of his speech delivered in the tense atmosphere and threat of violence between Serbs and Albanians:<p><blockquote>This is your land, your fields, your gardens, your memories are here. Surely you will not leave your land because it is difficult here and you are oppressed ... You should also stay here because of your ancestors and because of your descendants. Otherwise you would disgrace your ancestors and disappoint your descendants. I do not propose, comrades, that in staying you should suffer and tolerate a situation in which you are not satisfied. On the contrary: you should change it.</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
We all know how the Serbs in Kosovo went about trying to bring about change and how the bloodshed was eventually halted.</p>

<p>Clark is as underhand and as untruthful in each of his other attempts to whitewash Milosevic of responsibility for the crimes committed under his rule. Check the facts for yourself.</p>

<p>Quite why anyone would attempt to revise the truth about a dead dictator and his role in the Balkan wars is hard to understand.</p>

<p>After all, aren't there <a href="http://neilclark66.blogspot.com/2006/03/empire-defeated-in-belarus.html">still living and breathing dictators in need of western apologists?</a></p>

<p>Indeed, Harry, someone has to do it. What a disgraceful piece of journalism that was. I was truly horrified. I've read Clark's ludicrous writing before but to see such a serious subject given such pithy, dessert-sized treatment left me cold.<br />

<p>Harry</p>

<p>Your easy segue to Lukashenko in Belarus is hopelessly unsophisticated. Lukashenko is no Milosevic. When a country's economy is growing by over 7%, like Belarus, and the President doubles the minimun wage, one has to posit cleverer arguments than that. Simply shouting dictator and mentioning him in the same breath as Milosevic is wholly inadequate.  </p>

<p>Madiba, that rather depends on the value you place on political freedom, doesn't it? </p>

<p>I don't know your source for that 7%, nor whether Lukashenko really has doubled the minimum wage. All I would say is that anyone who has had to engage in serious study of statistics coming from Communist bloc countries soon learns that such stats are "cough", extremely contextual in nature. I wouldn't be surprised if the same went for modern Belarus.</p>

<p>The point is, when the economy is growing so strongly, and the government combines that with redisrributive measures, you are suddenly in an altered scenario. </p>

<p>This is the problem with Harry's simplistic argument. Its all one size fits all without any consideration of the shades of gray of reality.</p>

<p>It is true that Belarus needs stronger democracy. But it is also true that Lukashenko has some geniune support because of high growth and redistributive measures. Now, of course that does not excuse lack of democracy, but it does complicate the picture. Many Belarussians would be wary about substituting their system, with all its faults, for the gangster capitalism and huge wealth disparity of countries like Russia. </p>

<p>One could blithely say as a good neo-liberal that is all necessary, this is the medicine one has to swallow, but I don't live in Belarus and don't have to swallow it.</p>

<p>Madiba, in most dictatorships there will be some group within the population at whom some form of popularism is aimed. It's never aimed at everybody, nor necessarily a majority. For your point to stand, redistribution of income would have to be an benefit exclusive to dictatorships, but as it's not, it doesn't complicate the picture at all. There is still absolutely no excuse for Lukashenko not to put himself forward in a proper plebiscite. </p>

<p>As for him enjoying real support - all I would say is that there are plenty of groups who enjoy plenty of support but whose aims you'd completely oppose. It's not a reason to give them power. As to how much support Lukashenko actually has, you know perfectly well that the only way to uncover that is.. in a fairly conducted election. </p>

<p>Educated people of the West! <br />
You don't need to have any knowledge of the totalitarian economy such as Belarus to make a judgement about the 7% growth rate of the Belarusian economy. Do you remember Enron? Your very own democratic friends came up with the figures that they needed to attract investors. Why don't you think that Lukashenko cannot make up figures that he needs? If the answer is because the IMF and the World Bank cite these figures--it is wrong. On the one hand, they still say that these figures are from the Belarusian Ministry of Statistics and that they don't have any other data, on the other, they have no clue about the country that they are writing about. You know that they screwed Latin America, Africa, Asia, so why do you think they have enough knowledge to make judgements about Belarus? I think your paper is also prone to talking about things without understanding them. As far as I understand, you are a lefty paper. The people who contribute to it want to make a quick buck, i.e. write something which is currently an issue without doing any research on the topic. So, people like this Clark guy or similarly ignorant Almond write about Belarus what you buy: the neoliberal ideology is bad and Bush is even worse. It pays them money after all. Of course, the West cares about democracy in Belarus only because it has some significance. Nobody is doing anything for nothing. The significance of Belarus for the States is that Lukashenko trades the remains of the Soviet Army weapons to the rougue states. You first realised that Belarus existed on the map after the States found out that Lukashenko traded arms to Saddam. Anyway, what I want to say is three-fold. First, when you buy a newspaper you pay your hard-erned money, so be attentive to people like Clark or Almond who steal your money by selling you crap. Second, accept that unlike Blair or other EU leaders who did not have courage to make statements on Belarus and left it to the EU, Bush made such a statement. Lastly, if you don't like Bush then don't let Belarus became pro-American. Have you ever wondered why Poland, the Czech Republic and other Eastern European countries are pro-American? Because the US helped them to fight Communism (together with Mrs Thatcher who you also hate). Belive to a Belarusian: Belarus under Lukashenko has become a prison and people vote for him not because it is so nice there but because they may suffer if they don't. So, if you have a freedom of speach in your Kingdom, use it to say something meaningful about Belarus, something to show that you appreciate your freedoms and wish other people in the world had them.<br />
Many thanks!</p>
