	 Wanted: An Erich Fromm Party
    </h3>
	 
    

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      This piece of mine appears on The Guardian's <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/neil_clark/2007/02/wanted_an_erich_fromm_party.html">Comment is Free website.</a><br /><br />"A healthy economy is only possible at the expense of unhealthy human beings".<br /><br />I wonder what the social philosopher and psychoanalyst Dr Erich Fromm, the man who wrote those words over 30 years ago, would make of Britain today.<br /><br />Over the past decade we have witnessed an unprecedented period of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet our collective mental health has declined sharply. More than two million Britons are on antidepressants, a million on Class A drugs. Binge drinking, and what Fromm called "acts of destruction" - violence, self-abuse and vandalism - have reached record levels. The Samaritans report that five million people are "extremely stressed". Oliver James' new book, Affluenza, and last week's Unicef report, which listed Britain's children as the unhappiest in Europe, are powerful indictments of the society we have become. <br /><br />For solutions to our predicament, don't look to neo-liberal politicians such as Ed Vaizey, and other members of the political parties bankrolled by big business. And don't look either to short-term fixes like the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) advocated by Richard Layard.<br />Instead, turn to the work of Erich Fromm, one of the 20th century's most prescient - yet sadly neglected - thinkers.<br /><br />In The Sane Society (1955), Fromm argued that a society, in which "consumption has become the de facto goal", was itself sick. He advanced his theory of social character: that "every society produces the character it needs". Early Calvinistic capitalism produced the "hoarding character", who hoards both possessions and feelings: the classic Victorian man of property. <br />Post-war capitalism, Fromm argued, produced another, equally neurotic type: "the marketing character", who "adapts to the market economy by becoming detached from authentic emotions, truth and conviction". For the marketing character "everything is transformed into a commodity, not only things, but the person himself, his physical energy, his skills, his knowledge, his opinions, his feelings, even his smiles". (For a perfect example of a "marketing character", just think of the current inhabitant of No 10 Downing Street).<br />Modern global capitalism requires marketing characters in abundance and makes sure it gets them. Meanwhile, Fromm's ideal character type, the mature "productive character", the person without a mask, who loves and creates, and for whom being is more important than having, is discouraged. <br />Fromm was also deeply concerned with the way that love, "the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence" was undermined by an economic system which rewards greed and selfishness. <br />In The Art of Loving (1956), Fromm identified five types of love, all of which were endangered. Brotherly love, the most important, "the one which underlies all others", was undermined by the reduction of human beings to commodities. Motherly love was threatened by narcissism and possessiveness. Self-love, without which we cannot love others, was destroyed by selfishness. The love of God was regressing "to an idolatric concept of God". Finally, erotic love was debased by its separation from brotherly love and the absence of tenderness. <br /><br />In the turbo-capitalist Britain of 2007, the war against love which Erich Fromm warned of, has gone into overdrive. Glossy magazines encourage anti-love sexual permissiveness and the cultivation of selfish and materialistic lifestyles. Multimillion dollar industries promoting the cult of narcissism have grown up, in which reality television is the latest and crudest manifestation. We are encouraged to view all human contacts as expendable, to be "traded-in" whenever we can get a better deal. Hire and fire rules not just in the business world, but in our personal lives too. And we wonder why we are so unhappy.<br /><br />Erich Fromm shows us how we can fight back. The good doctor didn't just diagnose the disease, he put forward the remedies. There could be no improvement in our collective health unless society changed from the "having" to the "being" mode of existence. <br />The brainwashing methods used in modern advertising, described by Fromm as the "poison of mass suggestion" must be prohibited. The gap between rich and poor must be closed. A new, participatory form of democracy, "in which the well-being of the community becomes each citizen's private concern", must be introduced. There should be maximum decentralisation throughout industry and politics. And most importantly of all, ''the right of stockholders and management of big enterprises to determine their production solely on the basis of profit and expansion" must be drastically curbed. Fromm was unequivocal: the needs of people must come before the needs of capital.<br /><br />The measures that Fromm put forward will no doubt be dismissed by some as unworkable or too left-wing, (as indeed similar, sensible measures put forward by Oliver James have been). And as Fromm himself, warned big business would use all its "tremendous power" to fight such changes. But if we are serious about constructing a society in which solidarity and brotherly love come to the fore, nothing less than a complete overhaul of our economic system will do.<br />A healthy economy or healthy human beings? I vote for the latter. <br />How about you?

	 Sheridan Morley R.I.P.
    </h3>
	 
    

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      There's a wonderful obituary of Sheridan Morley, the writer, broadcaster and theatre critic who has sadly died at the age of 65, in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/17/db1701.xml&page=1"> Daily Telegraph.</a><br />Morley was a kind man but could be scathing in print. <br /><br /><em>"If you can bring yourself to imagine Liberace as King Lear," he wrote after an evening at Cliff Richard's musical Heathcliff, "you will perhaps have some concept of what takes place in what is indubitably the worst musical since Mel Brooks's Springtime For Hitler."</em><br /><br />He also had a wonderful store of anecdotes involving some of Britian's theatrical legends. <br /><br /><em>Morley recalled an occasion in the 1980s when, walking along Piccadilly with John Gielgud, they spotted Margaret Thatcher, then at the height of her powers, coming towards them. As they both knew her slightly, they stopped. Gielgud asked where she was now living. "No 10, Downing Street," replied the Prime Minister with some surprise. "Oh, you women!" exclaimed Gielgud, full of admiration. "Always so clever at buying the right kind of property!</em><br /><br /><em>Once, when Morley was crossing Leicester Square with Noel Coward, they saw a poster for an adventure movie starring Michael Redgrave and Dirk Bogarde entitled The Sea Shall Not Have Them. <br />"I fail to see why not," Coward remarked. "Everybody else has."</em>

	 Is there any way back for Robert Winston?
    </h3>
	 
    

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/story/0,,2015295,00.html">Here's</a> my piece on the banned jockey from today's Guardian.<br /><br />Is there any way back for Robert Winston? Having been warned off the track for one year, the future certainly looks bleak for the man who a decade ago looked to have the racing world at his feet. <br />In his darkest hour, Winston can however take heart from the fact that disgraced jockeys have resurrected their careers before. <br />John Egan, suspended from riding in Hong Kong after being found guilty of corruption (and currently awaiting trial in Britain for firearms offences), enjoyed a vintage 2006 in winning two Group Ones, the Chester Cup and the Ebor. And over the jumps Dean Gallagher made a successful return to the saddle after serving an 18-month ban imposed by the Jockey Club for failing a drugs test.<br />Winston says he is "determined to become champion jockey some day, with God's help". For that to happen, his first priority will be to regain the confidence of both trainers and owners. <br />Trainer Mark Brisbourne, for whom Winston has ridden winners, thinks it can be done. "I don't think many doors will be closed to him. He's young, fit and hasn't got any ailments. He has certainly got a future in racing." <br />Maintaining race fitness during his year away from the track will be a problem but at least Winston will still be able to work in a yard and ride out. <br />Perhaps the biggest challenge Winston faces during his enforced absence is a personal one. The son of an alcoholic, Winston had reached the age of 18 having drunk just one glass of cider. But a fateful double vodka, urged on him by fellow apprentices one day after racing, sparked off a gradual descent into alcoholism. <br />Things hit rock-bottom during a long lay-off with injury in 2005. Drinking every day from 1pm until the early hours of the morning, Winston's ordeal only ended when he checked himself in to rehab. A regular at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Winston admitted in the past that he was depressed when sober. But remaining sober is what he will have to do if he ever is to return to the sport and go anywhere near the heights he once reached. <br />After announcing his arrival in the sport in audacious fashion in 1996 by beating the 11-times champion Pat Eddery in a photo-finish when still an apprentice at Nottingham, Winston's talent and conscientiousness looked set to propel him right to the very top. <br />But while it is tempting to see as a turning point his horrific fall at Ayr in August 2005, which put him out of action for four months with a broken jaw and scuppered his chances of a first jockeys' title, we now know that the seeds of his decline had been sown some time before. <br />Sport is full of nearly men, highly gifted individuals who have come agonisingly close to glory but due to bad luck, mental weakness or sometimes both, have failed to get their hands on the main prize. <br />Robert Winston is going to find it very tough not to become the latest addition to their number.

      <p>
      For citizens of the USA, this is an important day in the battle to derail the neo-con war juggernaut.<br />Over to Carol Kramer: <br /><br />MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD TODAY! <br /><br />This week the U.S. House of Representatives debated President Bush’s plan to<br />send 21,000 more troops into the war in Iraq. Today they vote on the resolution<br />opposing the increase of troops.<br /><br />Please call your Representative TODAY. This is a critical time in our movement<br />to end the war. More is needed to make the U.S. secure in the world.<br /><br />Ask your Representative to take these three steps:<br /><br />1.     Vote YES on the non-binding resolution to oppose escalation of the war in<br />Iraq – but don’t stop there.<br /><br />2.     Take a real step forward for peace: Vote NO on the war supplemental<br />appropriations bill and stop funding the war in Iraq.<br /><br />3.     DO NOT escalate the war into Iran. <br /><br /><br />Here’s how to do it.<br /><br />-- Call the Capitol switchboard (202)224-3121 and ask to be connected to your<br />Representative's office, or go to http://capwiz.com/fconl/directory/congdir.tt<br />to find the direct phone number of your Representative.<br /><br />-- Ask to speak to your Representative’s aide responsible for Iraq War issues.<br /><br />-- Identify yourself and ask your Representative to take the three steps listed<br />above.<br /><br />-- Ask the office to send you a transcript of the Representative’s floor speech<br />on Iraq (all members have been given 5 minutes to make a statement on Iraq this<br />week).<br /><br /><br />Today's vote on the escalation of the war is a step forward, but it’s just the<br />first step. Non-binding resolutions aren’t enough. Congress must use its power<br />to end the war and bring the troops home now! <br /><br /><br />-------------<br />Carol Kramer<br />Democracy Rising<br />www.DemocracyRising.US<br />301-891-7700 <br /><br />The Democracy Rising peace project seeks to bring the troops home and end the<br />occupation of Iraq.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Democracy Rising<br />DemocracyRising.US<br />P.O.

	 John Howard should know his place
    </h3>
	 
    

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      This piece of mine appears in today's <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21232705-7583,00.html">Australian.</a><br /> <br />The PM should know his place in international affairs<br />All world leaders, not just John Howard, should stay silent about other nations' democratic elections and candidates <br /><br /><br />LET'S take a trip down memory lane, back to January 1995. Following Alexander Downer's resignation, John Howard is standing for the Liberal Party leadership for the second time. On announcing his candidature, he is astonished to hear US president Bill Clinton launch a fierce verbal attack against him, warning that a Liberal Party success in the next Australian election would be a victory for the "enemies of the free world".<br /><br />If you're having trouble remembering the hiatus caused by Clinton's intervention, don't worry. It never happened. But if it had, how kindly would Howard have taken it? <br /><br />The fact that no US president passed comment on his candidature in 1995 has not deterred Howard from poking his oar into the US presidential race for 2008. According to Howard, al-Qa'ida will be "praying as many times as possible for a victory not only for Barack Obama but also for the Democrats". <br /><br />Howard's intervention in the American political arena has been defended by Downer on the grounds that "it's a free world and we are entitled to a point of view". <br />Of course, Howard and Downer - like every citizen of Australia or any other country in the world - are entitled to a point of view regarding next year's US presidential election and which candidate al-Qa'ida would most like to win. (My view is that Osama bin Laden is praying right now for George W. Bush to pass a constitutional amendment and run for a third term.) But there are some solid reasons why the Australian Prime Minister and his ever-loyal Foreign Minister should have kept their views strictly to themselves. <br /><br />For a start, interventions from politicians and government officials from country A in the election campaigns of country B are usually counterproductive. <br />Earlier this year a letter from Tony Blair was published in Serbian newspapers: although it didn't name any particular politicians or parties, it made it quite clear that the British Prime Minister wanted the Serbs to vote for a "European future". The British ambassador chimed in, calling for the locals to "support the parties whose leaders share the European vision, who can be Europe's partners. Don't leave the choice to others." <br />The result: less than 30 per cent of Serbs voted for pro-European Union parties, with the Euro-sceptic and anti-Western Radical Party winning the largest share of the vote. Is it any great surprise that the Serbs didn't take too kindly to being offered advice on how to vote by the country that played such a prominent role in the NATO bombardment of Serbia just eight years earlier? <br />Last summer the US ambassador to Nicaragua, Paul Trivelli, labelled presidential hopeful Daniel Ortega a tiger who hadn't changed his stripes. <br />The result: a decisive victory for Ortega in November's elections. <br />Polish President Lech Kaczynski openly championed the Opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich in the 2006 presidential election in neighbouring Belarus. The result: Milinkevich polled 6 per cent. <br />And on it goes. <br />Call it pride, bloody-mindedness or simple nationalism. The point here is that no one likes to hear a foreign politician pass comment on their country's elections: the natural human reaction on being told by an outsider that candidate X or Y is no good, or will threaten the peace of the world, is to make the domestic voter more likely to vote for them. <br /><br />Then there is the sticky problem of what to do if the candidate who has been attacked gets elected. Former British prime minister John Major's special relationship with the US was never really that special after it came to light that Major's Tory government had looked into Clinton's student passport records on behalf of president George H.W. Bush during the 1992 election campaign. <br />Who could have blamed Clinton for not wishing to offer a cigar to a man who did his level best to ensure he would not be elected? <br />And Howard's damning verdict on Obama could easily come back to haunt him if the up-and-coming senator from Illinois does make it to the White House and Howard goes on to a fifth election victory. After what has been said, can anyone imagine a constructive working relationship being forged between Howard and Obama, or indeed any Democrat? <br />The truth is that Australia needs to have such a relationship with whichever candidate the American public elects, be it the ultra-hawkish John McCain or the anti-war leftist Dennis Kucinich. Howard's remarks may have blown it. <br /><br />Those defending Howard point out that in an increasingly interconnected, globalised world, the election results in one country are of great importance to others, particularly when the elections are taking place in the world's most powerful nation. And that alone gives leaders such as Howard the right to make their preferences known. But although it is true that next year's presidential election result will affect the lives of millions around the world, the fact remains that it's up to Americans - and Americans alone - to choose their president. <br /><br />The essence of democracy is that elections are the exclusive concern of the citizens of the sovereign nations involved, and that means no outside interference, either by means of other countries bankrolling particular parties or groupings (as the US has done on several occasions), or through partisan interventions such as Howard's. <br />It's perfectly acceptable for McCain or any of the other presidential hopefuls to claim that al-Qa'ida will be praying for an Obama victory. In the interests of democracy, it's completely unacceptable for an Australian prime minister, or any other foreign leader, to do likewise.

	 A Monument to Dubya

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      Dear Friends : <br /><br />I have the distinguished honor of being on the committee to raise $5,000,000 for a monument of George W. Bush. <br /><br />We originally wanted to put him on Mt. Rushmore until we discovered there was not enough room for two more faces.   <br /><br />We then decided to erect a statue of George in the Washington, D.C. Hall Of Fame.  We were in a quandary as to where the statue should be placed.   <br /><br />It was not proper to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a lie, or beside Richard Nixon, who never told the truth, since George could never tell the difference. <br /><br />We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest neo-conservative of them all. He left not knowing where he was going, and when he got there he did not know where he  was.  He returned not knowing where he had been, decimated the well-being of the majority of the population while he was there, and did it all on someone else's money. <br /><br />Thank you.   <br /><br />George W. Bush Monument Committee<br /><br />P.S. The Committee has raised $1.35 so far. (many thanks to Mr Oliver Kamm) <br /><br />pps(and thanks too to reader Bob Taylor for sending in the above)

	 A unipolar world is an undemocratic one
    </h3>

      <p>
      In case you missed it, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2011858,00.html">here's</a> Vladimir Putin's brilliant speech on international affairs, published in today's Guardian.<br /><br />Here are a couple of extracts worth particular consideration:<br /><br /><em>What then is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it describes a scenario in which there is one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making. It is a world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And this is pernicious, not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within. And this, certainly, has nothing in common with democracy. Because democracy is the power of the majority in the light of the interests and opinions of the minority.</em><br /><br /><em>We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law. One country, the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way. This is visible in the economic, political, cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations.</em><br /><br />Yesterday The Daily Telegraph asked its readers which country posed the greater threat to the peace of the world: Russia or the USA? <br /><br />An easy way to answer that is to get a piece of paper and write down the number of countries which Russia has attacked, or threatened to attack, in the last fifteen years. <br /><br />Then do the same with the USA.<br /><br />It's pretty one-sided isn't it?

	 A Serious Matter
    </h3>
	 
    

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>
      The Times, the oldest newspaper in the country, has long been regarded as a paper of record. Lies and misinformation in other newspapers should of course be rigorously challenged, but in the Times when a writer puts forward information which he or she either knows is false, or has no evidence to back up the assertion, it is arguably  even more serious, given the paper's historical reputation. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.stephenpollard.net/003141.html">Stephen Pollard </a>has done that today. <br /><br />In his <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article1375237.ece">bitter tirade </a>against members of the British Jewish community who don't share his opinions, he twice referred to the late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a 'genocidal butcher'.<br /><br />Pollard has been asked to provide evidence to back up this claim on several occasions before and has failed to do so.<br />He needs to be held to account.<br /><br />If like me, you feel strongly about this matter you can contact The Times editor, Robert Thomson either by email at editor@thetimes.co.uk, or at 1, Pennington Street, London E88 ITT. <br />The Times comment editor, Daniel Finkelstein can also be contacted at that address and by email at daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk<br />You can also send a letter to letters@thetimes.co.uk.<br />(If you'd like to contact Pollard directly to ask him about his sources, then his email address is stephen.pollard@cne.org)<br /><br />Pollard must either produce evidence to show that Milosevic was a 'genocidal butcher',(Milosevic's four-year trial at The Hague certainly didn't come up with any)or else desist from making the claim in a public arena.<br /><br />And unless Pollard can back up his allegation, The Times should print a retraction to say that their writer's claim was without foundation.

I am a regular contributor to The Guardian, The Australian, New Statesman, The Spectator, The First Post, R.F.O. and  Daily Express. My work has also appeared in The Fleet Street Letter, Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Times and in publications as diverse as The American Conservative, Pravda, The Morning Star and The Racing Post. 
I am strongly opposed to the neo-conservative war agenda -
and believe in the urgent necessity of a left-right anti-war coalition.
The choice facing us is stark: More Shock and Awe- against Syria, Iran or Belarus, or any other country which refuses to pay Danegeld to The Empire- or lasting peace and security- based on respect for the sovereignty of nations. It's time to make our stand. On domestic issues I support renationalisation of the railways and public utilities, a new top rate of income tax on the very wealthy, free care for the elderly, a free National Health Service including the restoration of NHS dentistry, protection of the Green Belt and the countryside, and the restoration of capital punishment. </p>  <p class="profile-link"> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10479041156190090119">View my complete profile</a> </p> </div>
