            are truly desperate days. &quot;What difference does it make to the 
            dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is 
            wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty 
            and democracy?&quot; As the world's greatest democracy unleashes the 
            full might of its military power on the people of Iraq, Mahatma Gandhi's 
            words have a special relevance.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One thing is for sure. The war against Iraq will not 
            be the war to end all wars. It will be followed by others, all fuelled 
            by the insatiable appetite for profits and power. Three years ago, 
            the same forces now executing Shock and Awe were dropping cluster 
            bombs and depleted uranium on civilian targets in Yugoslavia. In 2001, 
            it was the impoverished Afghans' turn to get the B-52 treatment, with 
            over 5,000 dying in the process.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
            two years from now we will no doubt be reading in the <em>Wall Street 
            Journal</em> of the danger Syria poses to world peace and how President 
            Assad is the New Hitler. After that it will be turn of Iran, Belarus 
            and Libya.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
            neocons and their liberal imperialist allies appear unstoppable. They 
            have hijacked the major parties on both sides of the Atlantic. Large 
            sections of the free world's media are in their hands, and they have 
            a whole entourage of journalists, eager and ready to peddle their 
            lies, acting, in the words of John Pilger, as &quot;handmaidens of 
            a murderous power.&quot;</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
            despite all the propaganda, sound bites, and outright lies, the overwhelming 
            majority on both sides of the Atlantic oppose the endless war policy 
            of their mainstream political parties. The demonstrations against 
            war in Iraq have been the biggest since Vietnam. In the U.S. and Europe, 
            antiwar marches have attracted people from all walks of life, not 
            just the usual peaceniks, trade unionists, and women's groups, but 
            soldiers, farmers, and businessmen too. After some initial squeamishness, 
            conservatives and socialists, right-wingers and Trotskyites, have 
            been marching together, united in their desire for peace. But encouraging 
            as all of this is, it will not be enough. To stop the War Party much 
            more is needed. The antiwar alliance has to be put on a more permanent 
            and formal footing. And that means the Left making a bold and historic 
            step. If we really do want to &quot;give peace a chance‚&quot; we 
            need to take off our beads, remove Joan Baez from our turntables, 
            and start to embrace warmly those at whom we have been hurling insults 
            for the last forty years.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I write 
            as a committed, and totally unreconstructed, Old Leftist. Yet if Pat 
            Buchanan announced he was standing for president again, I would be 
            on the next plane out to join his campaign team. But how many of my 
            fellow socialists would join me? Until the Left is ready in its hordes 
            to link up electorally with the Old antiwar Right, the brutal truth 
            is that we have no chance of defeating the Bush/Blair axis. With the 
            black smoke clouds rising above Baghdad, I believe it is now or never 
            for the antiwar Left to answer the call.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In order to do so, and to make the &quot;Peace Party&quot; 
            work, the Left needs to jettison some baggage and spruce up some of 
            its thinking.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since the 1960s, we have picked up several false friends, 
            who have done our cause no good at all, lost us immeasurable support, 
            and who have prevented us from making the alliances it was in our 
            interest to make. The first of these is political correctness. I was 
            a card-carrying member of the British Labour Party until Blair came 
            along in 1994 and told us we had to stop worrying and love Big Business, 
            Big Macs, and Big Bombs. I supported, and continue to support the 
            notions of a national health service, free school meals, and state 
            pensions. But I have never understood why a belief in the mixed economy, 
            where transport, the utilities, and the coal mines are publicly owned 
            and run for the benefit of the whole community also entails assenting 
            to same-sex marriages, an open door immigration policy, and free abortion 
            on demand. The most destructive, anti-conservative force in our societies 
            is not Old Left socialism, but unbridled free market capitalism, which 
            destroys communities, the environment, and traditional ways of living. 
            Pete Seeger, the authentic voice of the old American Left, a man once 
            described as &quot;so far Left he has probably never been called a 
            liberal,&quot; got it spot on when he said that he was more conservative 
            than Barry Goldwater. Goldwater just wanted to turn the clock back 
            to when there was no income tax: Seeger meanwhile wanted to turn the 
            clock back to &quot;when people lived in villages and took care of 
            one another.&quot; Political correctness, the biggest threat to free 
            speech of our time, has plenty to do with neo-liberalism, but precious 
            little to do with socialism. It is time once and for all to end what 
            Eugene Genovese has referred to as &quot;the irrational embrace by 
            the Left of a liberal program of personal liberation&quot; and for 
            the Left to stress, like Seeger did forty years ago, its positive 
            conservatism.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the key issue of globalization, there is much muddled 
            thinking too. The anti-globalizers of the Left correctly point out 
            the destabilizing effects of unregulated capital flows and rail against 
            the nefarious activities of parasitical currency speculators like 
            George Soros. Yet at the same time, most also welcome the unrestricted 
            movement of people, which too can destabilize societies, as well as 
            leading to the unemployment and lowering of wage rates of indigenous 
            workers.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Next up, the Left has to drop its traditional antipathy 
            to organized religion and, in particular, to the Catholic Church. 
            The Vatican has always been anti-Marxist-socialist, but it has, at 
            least in some teachings, occasionally been anti-capitalist too. Pope 
            Pius XI believed liberal capitalism and communism to be &quot;united 
            in their satanic optimism.&quot; Under the present Pope, the Catholic 
            social teaching has again been pushed to the fore and the Vatican's 
            criticism of hedonistic international capitalism has intensified. 
            The significance of the Pope's speech in Riga in 1993, where he condemned 
            &quot;the international imperialism of money&quot; and spoke of Marxism's 
            &quot;kernel of truth&quot; was, I believe, missed by many on the 
            Left. Far from being an enemy, the Catholic Church is an ally of all 
            those who oppose the tyranny of neo-liberal globalization and the 
            cult of materialism it engenders. It is also on the side of those 
            who oppose war. The Vatican stands for peace now as resolutely as 
            it did twelve years ago in the first Gulf War and in 1999 in the war 
            against Yugoslavia.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Last, but certainly not least, the Left needs loudly 
            and unequivocally to declare its support for the increasingly endangered 
            concept of national sovereignty. We must defend national sovereignty 
            not because we are nationalists but because we are democrats. The 
            very essence of democracy is that decisions are taken as close as 
            possible to those affected, and that those affected have a say in 
            the decision-making process. But this cannot be the case when the 
            decisions are imposed by supranational bodies such as the WTO, World 
            Bank, NATO, and the EU. The War Party of course sees national sovereignty 
            very differently. If there is one issue that clearly demonstrates 
            this and that demarcates who exactly the Peace Party's enemies are, 
            it is that of Kosovo. The &quot;humanitarian&quot; intervention, in 
            which a sovereign state that threatened no other was bombed for 78 
            days and nights for the way in which it prosecuted its own &quot;war 
            against terrorism&quot; brought all the imperialists out of the woodwork 
            for us to see in broad daylight. And what a sight it was. The Clintons, 
            the Bushes, Albright and Rubin, Gore, Lieberman and Dole, Tony Blair 
            and William Hague, Richard Cohen and William Cohen, Baroness Thatcher, 
            and last but not least, the &quot;contrarian&quot; Christopher Hitchens, 
            all clamoring to bomb Belgrade back to the Stone Age.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The very same people are as dismissive of Iraqi sovereignty 
            today as they were of Yugoslavia's four years ago. For the War Party, 
            national sovereignty is a tiresome, outdated, and disposable notion 
            that gets in the way of their plan to globalize the entire world and, 
            in the name of democracy and human rights, eliminate all known dangers 
            to the freedom of operation of Goldman Sachs.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
            steps outlined above are ones I believe the Left must take if an alliance 
            with the Old Right is to stick. At the same time, the Old Right needs 
            to shift a little ground too. Its antiwar, anti-interventionist foreign 
            policy stance is unimpeachable. But even something as splendid as 
            isolationism has to know its limits. Whether or not the U.S. executes 
            its murderers, denies transvestites the right to marry, or wishes 
            to protect its domestic steel industry is its own concern and nobody 
            else's, but issues such as global warming, wildlife conservation, 
            and a ban on the use of landmines can only be solved by international 
            co-operation. Acknowledging this does not make one a Wilsonian liberal, 
            nor does it undermine a principled defense of national sovereignty.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even if an Old Right and Old Left alliance can be 
            forged, many differences of opinion will of course remain. My views 
            on public ownership, health care, and redistributive taxation would, 
            I expect, be anathema to many conservative readers. My instinct on 
            passing any branch of McDonalds or Starbucks to search for the nearest 
            brick, however, is one I believe many conservatives would share.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the 
            most important issues of the day though, the issues that really matter: 
            globalization, war, the threats to national sovereignty, and the seemingly 
            relentless march of transnational capitalism, the Old Right and Old 
            Left are already, by and large, singing from the same hymn sheet. 
            The world of 2003, with its standardised shopping malls, skinny lattes, 
            and stealth bombers, is not the world any of us wanted.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many 
            believe that a move from the Left will never come. But there are already 
            positive signs. In France, Jean-Claude Michea in his book‚ <em>The 
            Adam Smith Impasse</em>‚ has called for socialism to be uncoupled 
            from liberalism and instead to draw its strength from &quot;the altruism 
            of ordinary people.&quot; The veteran British leftist Tariq Ali argues 
            for a &quot;campaigning coalition&quot; that unites &quot;all sections 
            of society&quot; to defend the public and its needs against the pirate 
            politicians who serve the interests of global and local financial 
            institutions. And when <em>Pravda</em> reprints an antiwar article 
            written by the editor of the <em>American Conservative</em>, something 
            strange and wonderful is surely starting to happen.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By allying ourselves with the Old Right, the Old Left 
            has nothing to lose and much to gain. Far from giving up our identity, 
            we will, I believe, be reclaiming parts long lost to liberalism. We 
            will be able to get back to basics and start to reiterate our core 
            beliefs. Our opposition to the international rule of money power and 
            the idolatry of market forces. Our unequivocal rejection of all forms 
            of imperialism, whether they fly under a military, financial, or human 
            rights banner. And above all, our denunciation of war as the primary 
            method of solving international disputes.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the moment, the imperialist bandwagon appears 
            unstoppable. But if we on the Left can conjure up enough courage to 
            step into the unknown and embrace an old enemy, then the days of the 
            War Party will be numbered. What is lacking today is a permanent, 
            populist, broad-based political force to challenge the worldview of 
            the serial globalizers and the advocates of endless war. The Peace 
            Party can be that force. The global crisis we face today makes the 
            old Left-Right arguments over public ownership and tax rates irrelevant. 
            Let's have those debates later, but first let's get rid of those who 
            threaten us with Armageddon. If we fail to grasp this historic opportunity 
            and allow political correctness and petty tribalism to hold us back, 
            the prognosis is bleak.</font></P>
          <P><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One can only hope then that they are starting to build 
            plenty of air raid shelters in Damascus.</font></P>
