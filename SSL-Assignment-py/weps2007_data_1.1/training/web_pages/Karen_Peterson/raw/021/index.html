<p align="center"><font size="+1">ABSTRACT</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This article presents a practice used to implement systems 
  change regarding the improvement of electronic and information technology (E&amp;IT) 
  access in the K-12 educational environment. The project is funded by the National 
  Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research of the U.S. Department of 
  Education as part of its initiative to promote the acquisition and use of accessible 
  information technology in elementary through postsecondary education institutions. 
  The project engages in simultaneous top-down and bottom-up activities to educate 
  stakeholders and demonstrate accessible E&amp;IT within and between the state 
  government educational agency and public schools. The top-down endeavor includes 
  establishing legislation on accessibility and working with the public education 
  department&#8217;s technology staff in creating compliance policy and practices 
  for public schools. The bottom-up approach includes establishing memorandums 
  of understanding with certain districts as demonstration projects where accessibility 
  is assessed and an improvement plan is developed and implemented. </font></p>

<h4><font size="+1">INTRODUCTION</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">Those who have worked in education over the past 30 years have 
  seen the speedy and monumental impacts of technology upon communication, curriculum, 
  learning, and administration. Some remember education without computers; some 
  have only heard about that reality. Many of today&#8217;s educational activities 
  involve electronic information in one form or another. The need for accessibility 
  of technologies for students with disabilities in the classroom is evident when 
  you consider the implications for major functions of communication and information 
  access such as those demonstrated in the following examples: efficient word 
  processing, construction and use of databases, electronic communication techniques, 
  spreadsheet information access, presentation of original thoughts, and insight 
  through electronic simulations.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> A variety of informational sources affect current thinking 
  about the value of accessible E&amp;IT for all students in classroom settings, 
  including those with disabilities. Moreover, clear negative implications exist 
  for post-school employment of students who do not possess competitive technology-related 
  skills. Existing research and literature reinforce the necessity for accessible 
  E&amp;IT use within America&#8217;s classrooms.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The question remains, &#8220;How can we assure that all students, 
  faculty, and staff have access to E&amp;IT?&#8221; The practices described in 
  this article were developed in response to this question.</font></p>
<h4><font size="+1">TOP-DOWN PROJECT ACTIVITIES</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">Several individuals motivated by the value of education, increased 
  use of technology, and the needs of persons with disabilities formed a team 
  to move forward on continually improving electronic and information technology 
  access in the K-12 educational environment in New Mexico. The project began 
  with the Accessible E&amp;IT in Education Project Coordinator at New Mexico&#8217;s 
  Technology Assistance Program providing presentations to various professional 
  education organizations asking school administrators, information technology 
  staff, special education directors, and faculty how students with specific impairments 
  received information relevant to their studies. That one question quickly generated 
  an interest beyond expectation. Several districts volunteered to join an exploratory 
  demonstration project aimed at creating an accessible educational environment. 
  Although this article focuses on the outcomes of one project, it also includes 
  results of simultaneous endeavors with a goal of making a progressive impact 
  on the state&#8217;s educational system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Prior to the beginning of our demonstration project, several 
  state agencies, including those with a focus on education and disabilities and 
  the New Mexico state legislature, worked together to establish a law requiring 
  that &#8220;Public schools that offer distance learning and computer-based courses 
  of study shall provide accompanying electronic formats that are usable by a 
  person with a disability using assistive technology, and those formats shall 
  be based on the American standard code for information interchange, hypertext 
  markup language and extensible markup language.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The promulgation of the state law led to questions of compliance. 
  Our Public Education Department&#8217;s Council on Technology in Education worked 
  with the Accessible E&amp;IT in Education Project Coordinator to incorporate 
  accessibility language in the state&#8217;s public education technology plan.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To complement the language incorporated within the technology 
  plan and to assure compliance in audiences responsible for implementation, the 
  Accessible E&amp;IT in Education Project Coordinator provided accessibility 
  workshops, policy and practices development and technical assistance to various 
  groups of educational professionals around the state. These groups included 
  the State Coalition of School Superintendents; a consortium of web developers 
  employed by public schools, community colleges, and universities; and special 
  education service providers.</font></p>
<h4><font size="+1">BOTTOM-UP PROJECT ACTIVITIES</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">Project activities in the small, rural district of Animas, 
  New Mexico began with the identification of a team consisting of a project coordinator, 
  an administrator, a technology staff person, and a special education administrator. 
  Later, students and faculty members were added to the team. Accessibility tests 
  performed by the team found the district&#8217;s Web site somewhat accessible 
  and conversations with several staff members and teachers identified only one 
  person who had &#8220;heard about&#8221; issues related to accessible electronic 
  and information technology. The project gained full support of the district 
  superintendent, who initially negotiated the memorandum of understanding with 
  the Accessible E&amp;IT in Education Project Coordinator. A written agreement 
  was instituted with deliverables used to guide each project component: (1) development 
  of procurement policy for technology: adopt accessibility standards, policies, 
  and/or practices in procuring and implementing accessible information technology 
  including appropriate language incorporated into the district&#8217;s Information 
  Technology Annual State Plan; (2) Web site accessibility: Modify district Website 
  to ensure Bobby Approved accessibility; (3) computer-based instructional materials 
  and distance learning courses: stored in accessible file formats; and (4) training 
  for faculty, staff and students.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Taxing schedules and demands of most team members made it especially 
  important for the Project Coordinator to keep the group on task. The work was 
  divided: the technology staff looked to on-line assistance for basic web design 
  accessibility attributes and reconstructed the district Web site; the special 
  education staff learned about how to compliment the use of assistive technology 
  with accessible information technology. The administrator developed a procurement 
  policy regarding accessibility to be approved by the district&#8217;s school 
  board. The technology staff provided training. All school faculty were given 
  three in-service training sessions on (1) built-in accessibility functions in 
  computers and accessible file formats, (2) accessible Web site development, 
  and (3) accessible information technology for students with disabilities. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a result of training, teachers instructed their K-12 students 
  on the development of accessible Web sites and the information technology staff 
  has become knowledgeable and skilled in the area of accessible technology so 
  that they may instruct other K-12 school district staff. </font></p>
<h4><font size="+1">EVALUATION OF PRACTICES</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">Indicators of success in meeting our project goals of increased 
  E&amp;IT accessibility include:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1"> The school&#8217;s Web site (www.animask12.net) is now 
    accessible to all students, staff, parents, and members of the community, 
    including those with disabilities. Specifically, all graphics were complimented 
    with alternate text and schedules were redesigned in table/text format rather 
    than PDF format. Teachers, who were required by administration to develop 
    their own Web sites, now develop the sites to be accessible with the awareness 
    that this is a work in progress and that Web sites will continue to go through 
    testing by the Accessible E&amp;IT in Education Project Coordinator and district 
    technology staff. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The technology staff became versed in accessible information 
    technology and is prepared to train other district technology staff through 
    a regional technology consortium. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">District technology instructors now include accessibility 
    lessons for students as part of their technology course curriculum. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In addition to students with sensory and mobility impairments, 
    those with learning disabilities have also benefited from access to information 
    through speech output, speech-to-text and other assistive technology. As documented 
    by the Brenda Richardson, Assistant Technology Coordinator for Animas School 
    District, &#8220;Students with specific learning disabilities have discovered 
    that using the narration and dictation of text features to be of assistance. 
    The students can utilize their time more efficiently to accomplish their tasks. 
    These students can effectively record their thoughts in a comprehensible fashion 
    using the dictation of text feature. One student in particular, is able to 
    dictate his original stories for English class into the computer without loosing 
    his train of thought about the storyline. After the dictation process is completed, 
    he is able to return to the written text to edit and format the original stories, 
    listening via text to speech output.&#8221; </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The district&#8217;s technology plan now includes language 
    on Web accessibility and procurement of accessible technology. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The district has upgraded three of their four computer labs 
    with current hardware and operating systems that possess built-in accessibility 
    features. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Yearly training in accessibility for faculty is required. 
    </font></li>
</ol>
<h4><font size="+1">LESSONS LEARNED</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">In this exploratory work, creating a diverse team to champion 
  an information technology accessibility project and develop and implement an 
  organized set of outcome deliverables proved successful in improving accessibility 
  at the district level. Each team member tackled tasks specific to his/her area 
  of expertise and subsequently learned from the others. The team readily realized 
  that they were not involved in overwhelming or costly projects, and showed a 
  great deal of enthusiasm. The team now provides technical assistance to other 
  districts ranging from a phone call or e-mail to a full training session. An 
  &#8216;expert network&#8217; is being constructed throughout the state. Since 
  accessibility knowledge and practice is now built-in to the curriculum and into 
  administrative procedures and practices, it is gradually becoming a standard 
  for practice. Students in technology courses are also learning about how to 
  improve access to information technology for people with disabilities.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The project benefited from the full support of the superintendent. 
  When asked about the impact of the project on the school district, Mr. Paul 
  Benoit, the Superintendent, said, &#8220;The accessibility project has heightened 
  staff awareness of the importance and availability of the wide range of software 
  and hardware and accessibility attributes that have been developed to assist 
  students with disabilities. In fact, all students are benefiting from this increased 
  knowledge and training our staff has received. The development of accessibility 
  policies and training, as part of our overall district technology plan, will 
  ensure continued focus on accessible technology by the district administration 
  and teaching staff.&#8221;</font></p>
<h4><font size="+1">CONCLUSION</font></h4>
<p><font size="+1">A synchronized top-down (legislation, public education agency 
  regulation and policy) and bottom-up (district demonstration projects) approach, 
  that included the provision of professional development workshops and technical 
  assistance, has generated an advancing dynamic toward improving accessible information 
  technology across the State of New Mexico. These dual strategies perpetuated 
  leadership and activities that promote the procurements, development and use 
  of accessible information technology. As summarized by Benoit:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">&#8220;As more schools become aware of the statutory requirements 
    around accessible technology, the impact around the state will be profound 
    for students with disabilities and for students who simply have struggled 
    with learning. The fundamental goal of this project was to improve student 
    learning through the use of accessible technology, and that is well on its 
    way in Animas and in the State of New Mexico!&#8221;</font></p>
