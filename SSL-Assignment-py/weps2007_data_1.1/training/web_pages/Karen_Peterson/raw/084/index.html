Originally from Novato, California, Karen graduated from Yale University in 2003 with a  B.S. in astronomy and physics. She continued to study astronomy in graduate school at UCLA, focusing on the X-ray properties of active galactic nuclei. In the end, however, a burning desire to “help people here on Earth” drew Karen away from research and toward the world of non-profits. After a brief stint as a high school chemistry teacher, Karen was excited to join the team at QuestBridge. Having grown up in a family full of educators, Karen learned early on to place a high value on education, and now she enjoys helping students to achieve their academic goals through QuestBridge’s programs.

Judith is currently on a leave of absence from Stanford University, where she will be a junior in the fall of 2006.  She plans to double major in psychology and architectural design, in an effort to understand the bidirectional influences of people and their constructed spaces. </p>
