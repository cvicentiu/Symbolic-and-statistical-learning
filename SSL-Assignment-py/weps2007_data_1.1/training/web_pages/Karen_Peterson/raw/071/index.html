  <h2>Fort Vancouver Regional Library District<br />Board of Trustees</h2>
The Library Board is composed of seven positions representing the Fort 
Vancouver Regional Library District. Since they are not compensated for 
their time, Board members are essentially volunteers. They are appointed 
by a joint resolution of the commissioners of Clark, Skamania and Klickitat 
Counties, generally for 7-year terms.  The three counties have signed a 
<a href="http://www.fvrl.org/aboutus/files/BoardAppointmentMOU.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> 
(it includes an amendment), to specify details about Board members' appointments.  Clark County has a <a href="http://www.fvrl.org/aboutus/files/board_appointing_clarkcounty.pdf">resolution</a> that describes their appointing procedures.<br /><br />

<p>Her strong interest in libraries led her to apply for a trustee position. "My mother was a librarian and I have always used the library," Karen said. "I worked in a library for several summers during my teen years, doing cataloging, reading shelves, that kind of thing."  </p>
<p>Karen feel strongly about the importance of libraries in a community. "Libraries are an invaluable resource," she notes. "They give people access to information and provide a forum for different forms of expression. And the most fabulous thing of all is that they are free."</p>

<b><a name="pos2">Merle Koplan</a></b><br />
<img src="Merle2.jpg" align="Left" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Merle Koplan" />
The City of Vancouver makes recommendations for appointments to two library board positions (positions 2 and 5). Merle Koplan holds one of these positions and her term runs through December 31, 2011. <br /><br />
Merle grew up in the other Vancouver (Canada) and completed a degree in elementary education from the University of British Columbia.<br /><br />
Formerly single parents, Merle and her husband Keith merged their two families of six children when the kids ranged in age from 6 to 13. All six children have since finished high school and have gone on to graduate from Washington colleges. She has eight grandchildren. Merle considers their family her proudest achievement.<br /><br />
These days you'll usually find Merle at Koplan's Home Furnishings in downtown Vancouver where she is not only a full partner in the business, but is involved in buying, sales, customer relations and interior decorating. The family-owned company has been in business since 1948.<br /><br />
Merle and her family are long-time supporters and users of the library. She's also a strong advocate for public library services and believes, "A good library is an integral part of a livable community and a resource that an entire community can use no matter what their age and interests. Vancouver is underserved in library facilities, so one of my goals as a member of the library Board of Trustees is to work towards larger libraries."<br /><br />

<b><a name="pos3">Bill Yee</a></b><br />

Reappointed for a second term to represent Clark County, Jerry King's position continues through December 31, 2008. <br /><br />
Jerry was born in Ferndale, Washington. He earned a bachelor's degree in history at the University of Washington and completed his law degree there in 1959.<br /><br />
For 29 years, Jerry worked as Vancouver's City Attorney before retiring in 1994.  When King first joined the City in 1965, Vancouver's population was 38,000 and the City Council met in Library Hall. The next year the weekly sessions moved to the present Vancouver City Hall located between East 13th Street and Mill Plain. Over the years, Jerry worked with the challenges of our increasingly complex society and government requiring more and more safeguards and regulations related to employment, land use and the environment. <br /><br />
Jerry remembers the very first book he checked out of a library. He was four years old, the place was Bellingham and the book was Muggins Mouse by Marjorie Barrows. He has been frequenting libraries and enjoying books ever since.<br /><br />

Jack attended grade school in eastern Idaho and, at the age of 12, moved to western Montana, where he lived 
until graduating from college. It was in grade school that he had his first interaction with a public library s
ystem. "We didn't have much money and rarely bought books. But I was an avid reader, so the public library was 
very important to me," he recalled.<br /><br />
After completing a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Montana State University, 
Jack and his wife Sherry moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, where they started a family. Jack 
worked there as a manufacturing engineer for Hewlett Packard. In 1985, they transferred to Vancouver to be back

He has also worked with families struggling with defiant and drug-addicted teens. <br /><br />
Jack and his wife Sherry have three grown children. His hobbies include photography, computers, rebuilding sports cars, and of course reading, especially non-fiction and science fiction. <br /><br />
American author Patricia McKissack said, "A library is a doorway to freedom," and Jack believes that today this is even more important. "Our modern, technological world offers tremendous knowledge and information to those that can access it - unprecedented in our history," he said. "The public library is key to ensuring everyone has access to this information, regardless of income or education level."<br /><br />

<b><a name="ed">Bruce Ziegman</a></b><br />
<img border="0" src="Bruce_Ziegman2.jpg" align="left" alt="Bruce Ziegman" hspace="5" vspace="3" />
Bruce Ziegman developed an interest in libraries early on. &quot;I have always been library-oriented,&quot; he notes, adding, &quot;I worked in a library as a Page while going to school and that gave me a feel for how libraries work and what librarians do. That, coupled with my natural affinity for books led to what has turned out to be a fascinating career.&quot;
<p>Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Bruce attended the University of Washington, where he obtained his BA in History in 1970 followed by a Masters of Library Science in 1973. Subsequent coursework in a variety of subjects include leadership, management, accounting &amp; finance, negotiations and writing skills.</p>
<p>After obtaining his MLS, Bruce landed a position at the North Central Regional Library's Wenatchee branch as a reference librarian. Several months later, he promoted to Coordinator of Extension Services, which included the responsibility for services and operations of 23 branch libraries. In 1975, he took the Coordinator of Central Services position and supervised book selection, technical processing and interlibrary loan for the system.</p>
<p>From 1977 to 1989, Bruce worked for a library automation organization known as the Western Library Network (WLN). His first three years there were spent providing training and customer support for a variety of WLN software programs. He also obtained seven years experience as Manager of Library (Customer) Services and two years as Director of the organization.</p>
<p>Bruce joined Fort Vancouver Regional Library District as Assistant Executive Director in 1989 and became Executive Director in 2001. <br /><br />
Along with his energy, creativity and enthusiasm, Bruce shares his strong belief in the value of libraries: &quot;Libraries add so much to society in so many different ways--culturally, intellectually, economically, and for just plain entertainment value. Libraries offer multiple learning and entertainment choices of interest to virtually anyone who chooses to avail themselves of the opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>In his free time, Bruce enjoys spending time with his family, playing golf, and is an avid Husky fan. </p>
