Honorable mention Manipulated Images 
<P> The bucket of yarn sat outside of a wool rug-weaving workshop in a small village 
  near Oaxaca, Mexico. <P>"I turned the corner and said, 'Aha, I need to 
  take a picture of that!' recalls Karen Peterson. Touring Mexico with a two-week 
  photography workshop through the UC Santa Cruz Extension, Peterson was enjoying 
  the scenery and the sights of Christmas preparations. She created her award-winning 
  photograph using the Polaroid emulsion-transfer process, placing the image onto 
  watercolor paper. The faint border around the image is part of the emulsion, 
  much like the white border around old black-and-white photos. <P>Peterson, 
  45, received her first camera as a child of 8. Because her family traveled a 
  lot and her father took pictures, she found it a "fun thing to do." <P>Over 
  the years, in addition to developing her eye for subjects, she has taken on 
  the challenge of developing and manipulating images. <P>"What I've lately 
  enjoyed is the Polaroid emulsion-transfer and image transfer process," says 
  Peterson. "After the image is developed, there's still another artistic process." 
  <P>She is also learning to hand-color black-and-white photographs through 
  the Palo Alto Adult Education program. She recently returned from a photo tour 
  of Paris and Normandy. <P>Some of Peterson's favorite photographic subjects 
  are landscapes, although she prefers simple images--doorways, windows and flower 
  pots--for Polaroid transfers. Previous entries in the manipulated-image category, 
  such as a bicycle and clay pots, have earned her a place in the Weekly contest's 
  annual exhibition. This is her first award in the competition. <P>Peterson 
  is activities coordinator for Avenidas' Senior Day Health Center in Palo Alto. 
  In her spare time, when not shooting photos, she sews and makes crafts.
