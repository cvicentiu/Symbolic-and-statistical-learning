The following is the latest in a series of legislative endevors in the
state of New Hampshire to correct the unconstitutionalities of our
home education law.  This is the legislation that *WILL BE* submitted
during the next legislative season.  The filing of the bills has already 
been done and the issue will go before the legislative bodies starting
in January.  We are not being covert in our actions. (See previous
posts on this issue).  We intend to have a law with which all persons
can comply in good conscience without the loss of ANY constitutional
liberties.
<br><br>
Any feedback on the issues at hand will be answered promptly and
respectfully.

A note on "The Ones Who Left Omelas."  There is a well-recognized
distinction, in moral philosophy, between INTENTIONALLY and
KNOWINGLY causing something to happen.  If we adopt a free market
economy, for instance, we KNOW that some people will be poor, and
that others will be rich.  There is a big difference between
tolerating that outcome, on the one hand, and taking money away
from some poor people in order to make other rich.  The first is
a free market, the second is theft.
<br><br>
I haven't read "The Ones Who Left Omelas," but I would guess that
the happiness of the village depends on INTENTIONALLY causing the
misery of the poor children that Judy has described.  If this is
so, it is a sad tale, but essentially irrelevant to any
discussion of freedom and family privacy.  
<br><br>
Judy, you have read it.  Is the misery of the children intended,
or merely accepted?

Personal response to Doris in NH from Scott at HSLDA.
<br><br>
Doris, I was one of two NH home schoolers who fought the
Department of Education for seven months over their effort to
triple the home ed regulations in 1988.  As you remember, home
schoolers won that fight -- or at least, brought them to a draw. 
I was NOT at HSLDA at that time.  I was, just like you, a citizen
patriot of New Hampshire.
<br><br>
My experience in that battle was that the regulations were
burdensome, and that there was a great danger that they would get
worse.  You seem to look back on the regulations as "the good old
days."  You rely on someone's opinion that the regulations were
"unenforceable."  Maybe you should have been on that committee
instead of me.  I DID NOT compromise away our rights -- Elaine
Rapp and I beat them to a standstill.  
<br><br>
The committee had two home schoolers, one ACLU lawyer, and eight
public school people, five of whom were lawyers.  Elaine and I
wrangled and negotiated until we got the regulations whittled
down from Ellen Ann Robinson's original draft, which was three
times more burdensome, to our final draft, which was only twice
as burdensome.  At that point, Elaine and I announced that we
could not sign onto the final draft.  The other nine members of
the committee said, in essence, "Too bad."
<br><br>
Elaine and I wrote a minority report, which was exactly like the
majority report, with one additional sentence.  When the majority
reported to the State Board of Education, we quietly sat and
watched.  Then the Board asked us for our position.  We said,
"Our draft is just like theirs, with the following sentence
added: 'These regulations shall govern the manner in which public
schools supervise home school programs; however, private schools
may also supervise home schools.'"
<br><br>
The State Board asked us why we felt we had to add that sentence. 
We shared most of the things that you, Doris, have been saying:
that home schoolers would go underground rather than submit to
the regulations, etc., etc.  Then the Board asked the rest of the
committee what was wrong with out proposal.  The rest of the
committee objected that it would leave home schools essentially
unregulated.  The Board rejected the majority report, and ordered
the Department to form a new committee to consider our proposal.
<br><br>
The Department never did form that committee.  Instead, Ellen Ann
Robinson introduced legislation that was essentially the same as
her first draft of regulations.  The New Hampshire home schoolers
amended her legislation by adding our proposal (supervision by
private schools).  As we all know, by now, that amended
legislation passed.
<br><br>
HSLDA did NOT come up with this "private school supervision" law. 
New Hampshire is the only state in the union with such a law.  
In MY humble opinion, New Hampshire's home schoolers were twice
spared from the speeding locomotive of triply burdensome laws,
each time because the private school supervision option derailed
the train.
<br><br>
Doris, I know you think we can do better.  I agree with you.  You
also think we could have done better.  I was there with the
regulations: I don't agree, but maybe I'm wrong.  I still do
believe that private school supervision is better than Ellen Ann
Robinson's wish list.
<br><br>
Let's move forward.  What shall we do to the pointy-headed
bureaucrats this spring?

I read through your new act. I thought that part of the
debate in NH was whether or not home schoolers
(non-institutional private education) were notifying the
state that they were going to home school or requesting
permission to home school. Do you really want to say that
the state of NH has authority to regulate home schooling or
is this the best you think you can do? (I do not want to
start a debate on this point, I just want to understand the
thrust of your law.)

It would seem that if one believes that their right to
educate their child is guarenteed by the constitution of
the United States (for any reason), then would this law
amount to a loss of constituional liberties?
 <br><br>
In your provision on the flag, it would seem that it
requires homeschoolers to have two flag poles and display
the flag. Would it be better to say something like "A
non-institutional private educator shall provide for the
display of the United States Flag?" 
<br><br>
In my opinion your english language requirments is a bit
restricitve. I can understand the requirement for english
instruction in reading, writing,spelling, grammar, and
civil government. I think you could also make a reasonable
argument for arithmetic and geography. But the other
subjects seem excessive. For most of the other subjects it
seems it should not matter. What is the underlying
goal/philosophy of this section?
<br><br>
Thanks.

It's taken a long time for people, in general, to *realize* that freedom is
a requirement for human survival, but it always has been.  To the extent
that a country is free, its people are happy and prosperous.  To the extent
The type of miserable conditions you cite, where people live as animals, is
exactly the case I mean.  Neither the rulers nor the ruled are living as
humans.  They are living as animals - predator and prey.

I didn't give further details.  Something beyond my opinion that supports this
notion is the literacy levels before and after the advent of public schools.
Or the general conditions of the communist block, contrasted with the free
world.  In order to see that these specific instances support my point, you
have to see that government run schools necessitate bringing force into the
realm of ideas - and that this is incompatible with human life.

<br><br>
This is not a parallel argument, so long as parents have free choice in
daycare (including none) and daycare providors have free choice in what
they will offer.
<br><br>
> A GOOD government school will provide a rich environment conducive to learning.<br>
<br>
But my point is NOT that the public school experience will always invariably
be bad, or that its *always* impossible to learn in public school.  My point
is that the nature of it is opposed to human nature.  Concerned parents,
teachers, and community can band together and create a good school through
investing tons of effort.  At what cost (in terms of effort) do we have
these *good* government schools.  Why not change the system, rather than
ask parents and teachers to donate their lives in service toward conteracting
its ill effects.

<br><br>
I give my parents (not government) credit for my ability to read and write.
I learned to read and write in a church pre-school.  If that hadn't been
available, they would have found some other means to handle the responsibility
of educating me.  My abilities are NOT due to the public school system, and
the abilities of most people are NOT.  The statistics suggest that public
school has lowered the literacy rate, not raised it.  People succeed
despite the system, not because of it; as they do in any socialistic system
where the state is turned against the citizenry.

<br><br>
To answer Judy: Not necessarily.
<br><br>
Will a child raised by highly educated and well-trained teachers in a
multi-million dollar school facility surrounded by books, high-tech
equipment, and the latest in educational technology learn to read?
Not necessarily.
<br><br>
According to our government some twenty to thirty percent of high
school graduates are illiterate.  In fact the highest literacy rates
in this country were _before_ public schools were forced on the
parents and children of the Cape in Mass.

I hate to interrupt a perfectly good argument ;-) but...
<br><br>
Unschooling should not be defined in terms of instructional time,
which is irrelevant to the crux of the philosophy.  The crucial
difference is that unschooling allows the child the freedom to direct
his own education. It is this self-motivation which yields dramatically
better results than compulsed or forced learning, at home or in an
institutional setting. It develops both the intellect and self-esteem.
<br><br>
IMO it is a simple question: does a parent wish to continually fight
the tide (require the child to endure regular instructional periods)
or ride the waves (be patient and wait for the child to indicate his
interest in a particular subject). Unschoolers do not necessarily
refrain from all attempts to interest their children in a variety of
subjects.  But the decision to pursue a subject or not must rest with
the child.
<br><br>
For most parents the problem with unschooling is believing that their
children are capable enough to direct their own learning.  Considering
our culture which basically distrusts children completely, unschooling
parents must develop this "trust" in their children's capabilities on
their own.
<br><br>
Most parents like to encourage their children. They "help" their
toddlers to walk and talk, and like to believe that they played a very
crucial role. Parents of larger families soon realize, as their free
time diminishes and they must re-evaluate priorities, that they did
not "need" to instruct their children so much.  A child learns from
watching and listening.  When a child is ready, he usually makes his
desires perfectly clear. This type of self-discovery enhances the
child's self-image as well as his intellect. Remarkably enough
children are natural learners.

<br><br>
For purposes of this discussion, it seems clear to me that there are two
choices:  people can be free to pursue what they think is best, e.g.
homeschooling, unschooling, Montessori, etc.;  or the government can be
empowered to ensure that everyone is taught ideas that are acceptable
to all, in a manner that is acceptable to all.
<br><br>
The farce lies in pretending that there is a set of ideas or methods that
are acceptable to all; and that anyone, regardless of how unfortunate
their circumstances, will be better off for having the choice taken away from
everyone.

Karen Peterson replies:<br>
 <br><br>
        Our bill grants the board of education the authority
        to write rules with respect to ATTENDANCE only.
 <br><br>
        We aren't notifying the state on the method or content
        of our education program, only that we are establishing
        a "non-institutional private education" program.  
        We cannot be denied because we never ask permission. 
        We simply let them know that we are in compliance with the
        compulsory attendance statutes so our children cannot be 
        considered truant, or CHINS (children-in-need-of-services). 
 <br><br>
        Our bill asks that we be treated the _same_ as other private 
        educators.  Thus, we are willing to put up with the trivial
        regulatory requirements that private educators currently comply
        with, such as flag display and instuction in the english language, 
        in order to be afforded the same protection that they have.

Karen Peterson replies:
<br><br>
        As to the loss of constitutional liberties, that happened
        ninety years ago in N.H. with the enactment of our compulsory 
        attendance law. Unless you are ready to abolish compulsory 
        attendance, we still must deal with the compulsory attendance 
        laws. Private educators already have the best deal with respect
        to compulsory attendance, so we are attempting to identify
        ourselves as private educators.

Karen Peterson replies:
 <br><br>
        First of all, the display is for all practical purposes 
        a moot point as it is entirely unenforceable. In order 
        to enter your home they must have probable cause indicating 
        that you do not display your flag.  Then they must obtain
        a search warrant.  Can you imagine them going before a judge 
        to obtain a warrant?  Not a problem, don't you agree?
 <br><br>
        The section of the bill in question discusses the display
        of a U.S. flag in public schools, private schools and
        now at home. It only specifies one flag pole.

        Again, we are not creating this statute for our
        own benefit. It is an existing private school statute
        that we are including ourselves into as we are identifying
        ourselves as private educators and must therefore act as
        private educators act.
 <br><br>
        If we agree to meet all the same specifications
        that the private schools meet, then how could the legislature
        possibly say that _we_ were being irresponsible educators
        without inditing all private educators at the same time?

        I hope that I answered some of your questions and
        clarified our position.

    Doris and I both enjoy emotionally inflammatory political rhetoric.  I

Karen,<br>
     Thanks for your reply.  Given the situation that you described, it seems best
for home schoolers to be treated like other private schools. When I read
through the bill, it occurred to me that it MIGHT be limiting the state to writing
rules with respect to attendance only. (I am not a lawyer.) From my perspective, I
would like this restriction more clearly stated.  However, I do not live in N. H.
and so have no say in how you improve your laws.  Thanks again for responding to an
interested outsider.

Scott at HSLDA, responding to Doris on proposed legislation.
<br><br>
Doris, I looked over your bill, adding "non-institutional private
education" as an option.  (Do you mind if I abbreviate this as
"NIPE"?)
<br><br>
Your NIPE bill could be a real help to families who have kids
with special needs.  Right now, such families cannot get services
from the state, because home schools are not classified as
private schools (under Federal law, the state must make services
available to kids in public and private schools, but NH argues
that home schools are neither of the above). 
<br><br>
I see that you only grant the Department rule-making power over
ATTENDANCE at a NIPE.  Departmental rules regarding approval of
curriculum and educational program are only applicable if the
families request.  
<br><br>
I think it is risky to give the Department the power to adopt
rules relative to REASONABLE criteria for approving NIPEs for the
purpose of compulsory attendance requirements (amended 186:11,
paragraph XXXV).  I know what you mean (which is that attendance,
and ONLY attendance, can be regulated), but I suspect that many a
judge would find some curriculum and faculty restrictions
"reasonable."
<br><br>
I am also concerned that the Department would not give out
special ed. money to "unapproved" NIPEs.
<br><br>
I suspect that you intend to bring equal protection challenges to
any regulations which unfairly burden NIPEs.  Remember, when you
do this, the _Blount_ case in Maine.  Not all home schoolers win
all equal protection cases.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
I am not opposed to your bill as it currently reads.  How can I
help?

Oh, I can think of others.  What you have presented is one middle ground
to the left and another extreme option to the very far right.  (or vice
versa, I'm not really talking political spectrums here).
<br><br>
1. People can be totally free to do whatever they please from providing their
children with the best possible education to providing them with absolutely
no education nor any opportunity to obtain one.
<br><br>
2. People can be free so pursue what they think is best regarding the education
of their children with minimal interference to ensure the children are
learning at least something.
<br><br>
3. People can be free to pursue what they think is best with significant
interference to ensure that the children are learning according to the 
prevailing standards  of the time.
<br><br>
4. People have no freedom to choose and must submit to the governments 
determination of what it feels is best.
<br><br>
The problem is that I am argueing number 2 but SR refuses to accept that 2
exists and insists that number 1 is the only acceptable alternative since all 
children will obviously learn regardless of what the parents choose (unless, 
of course, they choose to use a government school in which case the child 
cannot possibly ever learn anything).  So any check whatsoever at all is
the equivalent of the government mandating what it wants and the parents 
having no choice whatsoever at all.
<br><br>
The world is just not black-and-white and insisting that it is does not make
it so.  That being the case, I do not see #1 as acceptable because while 
a genius may learn regardless of the circumstances, they are the exception and
not the rule (IMO, of course).  And a child denied any type of enrichment and
denied any kind of educational stimulus may well flounder.  And when the loss
of freedom is so minimal that its infringement is hardly felt and the gain is
children's lives, I have a hard time accepting the argument that the pay off
is not worth the intrusion.
<br><br>
But I am sure many are tiring of our personal argument.  I am clearly not going
to sway SR and he is clearly not going to sway me.

Education isn't what it's cracked up to be. I've been at it for three
years now: but just listen to Scott go on. I guess we'll have to wait
until he's ready to learn. I *am* an unschooler, after all. ;-)
<br><br>
Btw, I hope Scott doesn't mind a little gentle teasing.  He's just
gotta get with the *program,* s'all.
<br><br>
The intent of my previous posts was to disabuse 'true-believers' from
relying exclusively upon the "sneaky, dastardly, lawyerly" actions (to
use your words) of a certain group of people who profess to be the
benefactors, or 'saviors,' of all home educators.  But if you insist,
I'll try education one more time, with extra-special feeling, from the
top. ;-)
<br><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>
The intent of my previous posts was to disabuse people of the notion
that they can rely on 'hired guns' to do their work for them.  The
system was set up in the first place under the assumption that the
average person would be politically involved, at *least* at the local
level ('local' used to mean U.S. House district, btw, but I'd settle
for a state legislative district or two).  
<br><br>
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" is literally true: you
can't just send money to various organizations and vote.  That's not
"vigilance" because it's too easily subverted.  Just sending money
doesn't work because, once sent, you generally have no control over
*how* it's spent.  Just voting doesn't work because the various
interest groups can rig the process via "interesting" ballot laws and
control of who gets nominated.  The only way to beat any of this is to
get *personally* involved.
<br><br>
IMNSHO, the progressive failure of good people to involve themselves
over the last 100 or so years in the "dirty" game of politics is the
primary cause of the situation we find ourselves in.  Everybody's
always got something better to do than "waste their time on politics."
The result is political discourse dominated by special, rather than
general, interests.  The only people who end up participating are the
vultures who hope to gain personally from the exercise of power.
They're always the ones that end up in legislative leadership: they
have the most to gain from such positions of public trust.
<br><br>
Now, I'm not blame free in this matter: until four years ago I didn't
involve myself personally either.  I suppose passage of a law that
purported to give the State the power to dictate what I could teach my
children exceeded the limit of what I could tolerate.  The impulse to
action was a review of a book that appeared on the net entitled "They
Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-1945."  It consists of
in-depth interviews of ordinary people who lived through the Nazi era
in Germany.  I went out and bought a copy and read it.  What leaps out
from the pages is the fact that Hitler *could* have been stopped
relatively easily (or at least slowed down quite a bit) if only people
had resisted the beginnings, if only people simply *refused*, even
privately, but better publically, to go along to get along, *refused*
to compromise, *refused* to silently consent to their gradual
enslavement.  Every single refusal throws sand into the gears, every
single refusal is a brush fire that has to be put out, derailing the
opposition agenda and forcing them to *react* instead of act.  Public
refusals disrupt our opposition's program a lot more than private,
because they act as rallying points for others.  But you have to do it
*in person*.  No one can act as your agent.
<br><br>
Perhaps with that as background, you can begin to understand my
frustration with the HSLDA types and the people who follow them.  It's
not so much their political screw-ups per se, though these are bad
enough, but their *attitude* I find maddening.  Because it's
*precisely* "go along to get along, this is the best we can hope for,"
etc., etc., etc.  They won't have anything to do with the politics of
confrontation: they won't simply *refuse*.  And in failing to do so,
they give aid and comfort to both my and their oppressors, whether
they realize it or not.  They provide, with a nod to Rand, the
sanction of the victim.  And the machine chugs on, because there's not
enough sand in its gears.
<br><br>
It's really amazing the effect one person or a few persons can have on
the system.  *It was designed that way.* We, *personally,* go up to
Concord every year and make a big stink, and, lo and behold, *they
leave us alone.* So far, we know of *no* case where a simple refusal
to comply with the law has been challenged by the state.  A bad law is
no law.  The only people who have problems that we know about are
those who start out trying to obey the law.  The bureaucrats jump on
these people because they know they're easy targets.  Be a hard case
and they've steered clear.  If *piles* of people were hard cases, our
not-so-esteemed opponents would back down.  They always do when
confronted personally, at least at this stage on the road to serfdom.
"The Chancellor has been elected" all right, but he can still be
nit-picked to a standstill: he has very little good help.
<br><br>
All it takes is the will to do it.  Caving in and adopting the enemy's
tactics are guaranteed to result in the eventual co-option of those
you hire.  No matter how zealous the hired guns start out being, the
enemy can always outbid you for their services, leaving you
defenseless.  Heck, most of the time your hired guns end up *becoming*
your opposition, the Magnificent Seven notwithstanding.
<br><br>
There's no substitute for personal involvment.  It's messy, it's ugly,
it costs money, it takes time away from your job and kids, it drives
you batty with frustration at times.  But the system *requires* this
sacrifice of you: if you won't do it, you're going to get tyranny,
will you or nil you.  That's what Franklin meant when, after the
Constitutional Convention, he was asked what kind of government he and
his cohorts had created.  He is rumored to have said,
<br><br>
"A Republic, if you can keep it."

Scott at HSLDA, responding to Karen Peterson's response to
Guerney Hunt's response to the proposed NH law...
<br><br>
Karen, I can see that you and Doris intend to limit the State
Board's authority to promulgate rules to ATTENDANCE only. 
Unfortunately, I am not sure that a court will stick to the
"original intent" of this language.  I know you only give the
Board rule-making authority to set adopt rules, "relative to
reasonable criteria for approving non-institutional private
education programs for the purpose of compulsory attendance
requirements," but I suspect that judges will interpret
"compulsory attendance" to mean a lot more than ATTENDANCE.
<br><br>
Do you have some particular reason why the judges will stick to
your original intent, when they rarely seem to care about it in
other contexts?

I'm not denying that (2) exists, my position is that (2) is merely a transition
stage to (3) and ultimately (4).  I am arguing that there is a fundamental
difference between (1) and all the others, whereas (2 - 4) differ only by a
matter of degrees.
<br><br>

<br><br>
It depends on what you mean by black-and-white.   Particular people,
governments, institutions, etc. are seldom purely good or bad, but that
does not change the fact that there are black-and-white standards by which
they can be judged.  Different people may have different standards, and
so may make different judgements - that means that someone's standards
are wrong; but there is still *some* standard.  The idea that there
are no standards is something I'm *really* opposed to.
<br><br>
Remember that a thief is not a person who *always* steals - a thief is a
person who engages in stealing, no matter how seldom or small the amount.
This is a reflection of the idea that it is possible to define right and
wrong in terms of clear cut principles (black-and-white) that should never
be violated.
<br><br>

That, and the fact that good people often have not had the philosphy

How well said!  There is another book called "The Ominous Parallels" by
Leonard Peikoff that goes into the culture of Weimar Germany leading up
to Hitler, and how this culture made it easier for Hitler to do what he
did - then parallels between the culture of Weimar Germany and the culture
of America today are drawn.  Pretty eye opening.

<br><br>
This is a good point.  It seems, in a effort to get the government off our
backs, it is easy to get sucked up into the political process and become
part of the problem.

This is very encouraging.  It surprises me to hear that you don't seem to
need legal help to keep the bureaucrats at bay.  It very encouraging to
hear that they still back down.

A politician or bureaucrat should never underestimate the impact of
even one angry, but persistant, citizen.  Any reasonably intelligent
person can match a lawyer, if he takes the time to do so.  Computer
programmers are better at dealing with masses of mind-numbing detail
than almost any lawyer I know. But, I'm only a little ol' house wife,
what do I know? ;-)

Good reference, but the point of Les Mis is justice.  There is no
question that a crime has been committed, the question is what is
justice and the role of law (in Les Mis).  You were questioning whether
there are absolute standards by which right and wrong can be judged.
<br><br>
I claiming that (2) leads (4) because (2) conceeds the premise that there
is a valid role for government force in the realm of ideas (education).
Once the use of force is legitimized there is no limit on its use.

Bad analogy.  Our politicians like to play the incrementalism game.  As long
as you beat them over the head, they won't interfere, but give them an inch
and they take a thousand miles.  An example is gun control.  How many remember
when gun registration was enacted in New York City?  It's proponents claimed
that they were registering only, and registration would only cost $3 forever,
and the laws would never become any more strict.  For over 200 years NYC was
free of any gun regulation.  And now, starting with "minimal interference,"
almost all firearms have been banned in just two decades.
<br><br>
As soon as we allow government regulation to go beyond objective, obviously
harmful acts like starvation, severe beating, or sexual abuse into subjective
measurements of "fulfillment" like quality or thoroughness of education, we
will open the door to complete State ownership of children.  In fact, the
door is already open and it is time to slam it shut.

The regulations had no force of law.  Those *were* the good old days.
I simply informed my local school superintendent that the state issued
"Guidelines" for Home Education were just that, optional.  I explained
to him that he had the power to make as many exceptions as he wished.
And he did.  I was totally free then to educate my children without
any interference.  This was the situation in the vast majority of
school districts in N.H..
<br><br>
The "someone's opinion" that I considered significant was Sen. George
Disnard's, the sponsor of the current home education law.  Ellen-Ann
Robinson was just a flunky.  When he said the regulations were
impossible to litigate and therefore a problem for the state, he was
making an accurate assessment of the situation.  The regulations had
very limited statutory authority. They were derived from the "manifest
educational hardship" clause, whose intent was extremely vague and
ambiguous, which granted exclusion from the compulsory attendance law.
*Any new regulations would have been equally unenforcable.*

<br><br>
Perhaps I should explain my skepticism concerning your joint efforts
on this regulatory review committee.  From Elaine Rapp's May/June 1988
newsletter, N.H.  Home Schooler Newsletter (Subscriptions cost $3.00
per year. As a subscriber I did not elect Ms. Rapp as my state
spokesperson. This was apparently a "self-appointed" role.):
<br><br>
"As chairman of the NHHEA I feel this organization represents many
styles and philosophies of home schooling, and as such, has an
obligation to PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL by NOT taking an ANTI-STATE
position."
<br><br>
This does not seem to be very 'confrontational.'  She continues:
<br><br>
"...If we recognize this and encourage people to APPLY through the
regulations so that confrontations between home schoolers and school
authoritites do not arise, I believe we will be in a good position to
work with the state in making changes to the regulations."
<br><br>
Let's 'go along to get along,' guys. This is just one issue.  The theme
was always the same: "It's bad up there in Concord. Compromise a little
or things could very easily get worse. Your actions could negatively
impact all of us, please COMPLY with the state."
<br><br>
Remember the 1991 fiasco at NHHC (the state-wide group organized to
keep all home educators politically informed, but which was actually
run as front for the Dept. of Ed.) with ex-public-school-teacher,
non-home-educator and Coordinator Mary Faiella violating the group's
by-laws in order to insure that home educators *comply* with state
regulation?
<br><br>
These were not isolated events. They represented a continuous
pattern.  All home education 'leadership' (which has included NHHC,
NHHEA, CHENH, CUHE and HSLDA) promotes 'state compliance' not
individual rights. All except the N.H. Alliance for Home Education.

<br><br>
This wonderful private school option is no panacea. The private school
is simply an 'overseer' for the commissioner, who controls home
education.  He has the statutory power to accept or reject home
education proposals, not the overseer. He has the statutory power to
place home educators on probation or terminate their programs, not the
overseer.  What is so wonderful about having a private school become
the state's shill?

Ellen-Ann's wish list was politically impossible.  As I have already
pointed out, how could the legislature have required teacher
certification, which would have dis-qualified most parents from home
education, and then ask those same parents for their support to pass
the measure?  That is why Ellen-Ann was forced to back down and
withdrew her support from the bill.
<br><br>
IMO the past 'leaders' of the 'movement' have frittered away enormous
political clout they might have used to protect parental rights.
Several hundred home eduators showed up at Concord on four separate
occasions to defend home education. This is extremely unusual for N.H.
Only gun owners have exceeded our numbers in recent memory.  The
legislature does not try to directly oppose such large groups. We
could have put this political capital to better use.  300 people at a
hearing can block *any* legislation in this state.

We have not even established that we are really on the same side,
Scott.  As a matter of actual historical fact, you and your allies
have stood with the Dept. of Ed. at *every* legislative encounter.
How could *we* possibly move forward?
<br><br>
Why do you support our parental rights amendment when you believe it
will only work for Kentucky home educators?
<br><br>
Are you finally supporting, not attacking, our efforts towards the
recognition of parents as private educators?  Your comments on our
pending legislation indicate that you are still skeptical.  What type
of 'support' are you considering?  The legislature can smell lack of
commitment a mile away.
<br><br>
Are you going to encourage HSLDA not to attack our efforts in the
future?
<br><br>
Are you going to explain the sudden 180 degree turn around to N.H.
home educators?  That would require a public retraction by HSLDA.  And
by public, Scott, I mean on the net, in your legislative bulletins
and, most importantly, before the legislature.
<br><br>
How is HSLDA going to have any credibility, unless they publically admit
they were wrong to oppose our efforts, if they are to suddenly endorse
the very same efforts they opposed?
<br><br>
How do you think we can get people out to support something HSLDA
condemned not once, but twice?
<br><br>
Am I to trust HSLDA just like that?  No apology. No explanation. HSLDA
has been my *major* opposition for over four years now.
<br><br>
I am truly listening, Scott. It's just that I don't hear anything
substantive yet.  Please pardon my skepticism: I have been burned by
well-meaning and pleasant-sounding home educators before.
