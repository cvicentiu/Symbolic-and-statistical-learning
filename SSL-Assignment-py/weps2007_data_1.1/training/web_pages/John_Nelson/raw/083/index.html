	  LIFE HISTORY OF JOHN NELSON
	</H2>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<BIG>(JANNE NILSSON)</BIG>
	<P>
	<P>
	John Nelson was born April 24, 1839 to Nils Olsson and Kjristi Larsson in
	Ossjo, Kristianstad, Sweden. He had two sisters, Botila and Petronilla, and
	six brothers, Ola, Lars, Christopher, Pehr, Pehr, and Lar. There is not much
	known about his early life in Sweden. There were two distinct classes in
	Sweden at the time. The Poor and the Rich. He was of the poorer working class
	and had to work very hard. Most of the farm work was done by hand as they
	had very few horses in Sweden. He walked many miles each day to help thresh
	rye by hand because they had no threshers and then walked back home at night.
	He owned no land while he lived in Sweden.
	<P>
	He was a farmer and a baker. He taught his sister, Petronilla, the bakery
	business and she was to help him with the business. She married a Mr. Anderson
	from Illinois in America and they came to America to live so he had no help.
	<P>
	On May 24, 1861, he married Hester Elena Olsson, daughter of Ola Bengtsson
	of Liungby, Kristianstad, Sweden. They were parents of ten children: seven
	boys, Carl, Oscar, Alfred, Olaff, Antone August, Nels, and Joseph; and three
	dauaghters, Amanda, Marie and Amanda.
	<P>
	For a short time after their marriage they ran a small bakery at the crossroads
	and sold bakery goods to the travelers. He specialized in rye bread. He worked
	on farms for other people. They never received any money for their work,
	but received their pay in so many pairs of pants, shoes, etc. The working
	class were treated almost like slaves by the higher class. He often told
	his family that when the working class would go in a store they would be
	ignored until the higher class customers were taken care of.
	<P>
	Two of his brothers were shoemakers in Sweden. Two of her brothers came to
	America. They were Pehr and Carl Olsson.
	<P>
	Two of his brothers joined the Army and they had to change their names because
	there were so many soldiers with the same names as theirs. They chose the
	names of Lindow and Lindall.
	<P>
	In 1871 John and Hester Elena decided to come to America with their five
	children. They came by stearage and had to bring enough food to last them
	for the journey which took several weeks. His wife's brothers in America
	loaned them the money to come to America.
	<P>
	His brother, Lars, had already come to America and had settled in Illinois.
	His brother had two children but they died in infancy. He later returned
	to Sweden.
	<P>
	They arrived in Marshalltown, Iowa, and stayed there with some friends. During
	the first night, their sixth child was born, a little girl whom they named
	Marie Christina. When mother and child were able to travel they went to Sac
	City, Sac County, Iowa. They lived here for several years and four more children
	were born to them. They all worked very hard and were soon able to buy forty
	acres of ground. they kept adding to it until they had ___ acres, a real
	large farm. He donated an acre of ground for the first school of Sac County.
	They were all so busy making a living that the children didn't have time
	to go to school all the time.
	<P>
	His son, Olaf, was drowned while they were living here. He was about 12 years
	old. He was out with his brothers herding cows and tried to swim across the
	stream. His mother had warned him not to.
	<P>
	John had a good singing voice. He would get up early in the morning and make
	the fire and then walk back and forth singing. he was a very talkative man.
	He loved to talk and visit with people. He was always bringing people, ministers
	and others, home from church for dinner. They didn't have much food, but
	he was always willing to share what he had.
	<P>
	On March 13, 1881, his wife, Elena, died from tuberculosis. She was sick
	for a long time. When she became worse they sent their daughter Mary to the
	neighbors for help. When she got back her mother had died and her father
	was standing over her praying.
	<P>
	He hired a young Swedish girl, Emma Louise Vickbom, to work for him and help
	care for the Children. Emma had just come over from Sweden a short time before
	to live with her Uncles, Sol and Gus Peterson. She had one full sister, Mathilda
	and four half sisters, Catherine Elizabeth, Charlotta Christina, Anna Sofia,
	and Inga Mathilda. Her parents and sisters had all passed away before she
	left Sweden.
	<P>
	Emma Louise went to school in Iowa for a short time, but the children laughed
	at the way she talked so she quit. She would box the boys ears for laughing
	at her. She was engaged to Carl Nelson but he died of Smallpox.
	<P>
	John Nelson had rheumatic fever and was up to a hot Springs taking treatments.
	It was while he was here that he decided to marry Emma Louise. They left
	and didn't tell the children they were going to get married. The lady that
	was staying with them at the time told them they were going to have a new
	mother. They were married April 21, 1882, in Sac City, Iowa. They had two
	children born to them in Iowa. Elena in 1883 and Anthone in 1884. At this
	time they decided to leave Iowa because this climate was bad for his health.
	He first went to Alabama to find a home but didn't like it there. They heard
	that there was a lot of free land in Nebraska, so they decided to go there.
	He thought the dryer climate here might be better for him. They sold their
	farm and part of their machinery and lifestock and loaded the rest on a railroad
	car. Grandma was expecting another child at this time so she and some of
	the younger children stayed in Iowa until he had located a home for them.
	<P>
	He soon sent for his family. They were supposed to arrive in Chappel, Nebraska
	at midnight, but the train arrived early, at noon the day before, so no one
	was there to meet them. The man at the station took them out to their farm
	at Chappel, Duel County. They homesteaded between the North and South Platte
	Rivers. They lived here for nine years but never raised a crop in all those
	years. The grain would come up and look real good and then they would either
	be
	<P>
	(Part of History Missing)
	<P>
	They lived in a board shack in Nebraska not a sod shack as many others did.
	<P>
	One time when they were hauling water, Joe fell off the wagon and one wheel
	ran over him.
	<P>
	After nine years of hardships they decided to seek a new home. In 1894 they
	left their home and started West. They had heard of a place in Idaho where
	a lot of Swedish immigrants had settled near Eagle Rock, now Idaho Falls.
	<P>
	They had an auction before they left and sold most of their belongings. Mary
	and Amanda had been living in Denver working and had come home to tell the
	rest good-bye. Amanda caught mountain fever and died the night before the
	auction. They had six horses, two wagons and one white top buggy and they
	loaded all their belongings onto these and left. Joe had mountain fever when
	they left Nebraska and they didn't know whether he would live or not. Arthur
	(Nels) Anderson, Grandpa's sister's boy, came with them and drove the team
	Joe was supposed to drive.
	<P>
	They would mix bread in the morning and bake it after they had stopped at
	night in the stove they had to lift down from the wagon to use. When they
	got to Green River, Wyoming, it rained so hard Grandma had to stand up to
	her ankles in mud while she baked the bread. They also did their washing
	at night when they stopped.
	<P>
	Grandfather had 50 cents in his pocket when they arrived in Idaho. He went
	to the Anderson Bank and told them he had some land and was going to settle
	there and needed some credit. He bought wheat for flour, sugar and other
	staples. He also bought some lumber to make sawhorses and two planks to put
	on them for their first table. They settled in the area north of Idaho Falls
	near one of the big canals. Jack was born shortly after they arrived in Idaho
	and Phoebe was born while they were still living in this area.
	<P>
	They moved to the New Sweden area South of Idaho Falls where they were living
	when Emil was born. John joined the Baptist church in New Sweden.
	<P>
	They then moved to Lavaside where they homesteaded and in addition bought
	some land both totaling 300 to 400 acres. John later sold some pieces of
	this land. Clarence was born while they lived here. In November 1902, John
	died of pneumonia at the age of 63. Harold was born two months later.
