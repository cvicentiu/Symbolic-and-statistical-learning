 John Nelson is a Seattle based musician, songwriter, composer and producer/engineer. His sound is an eclectic blend of influences combining elements of blues, country, folk, swing, and world music. His original compositions have appeared on albums, radio, and video. A native of the Pacific Northwest, John has played with a variety of groups including The Air Streams (country honky-tonk), The Shimmering Guitars (twang, surf and blues) and Max & Johnny (original acoustic folk/blues/rock). As a songwriter his compositions evoke themes of love and loss, introspection, wanderlust, and character portraits. <br />
<br />
His first solo album, Soliloquy, is an intimate collection of original acoustic guitar instrumentals. The songs are meditative, inspiring, and calming. Some are lullabies, others uptempo, all with varying feels and time signatures. They are being listened to during massage, meditation, and whenever a relaxing mood is desired. These songs were inspired by, and are dedicated to the patients and staff of Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.<br />
<br />
Since it's release in the spring of 2003, Soliloquy has recieved many favorable reviews. (see below)

Offering ensemble and solo instrumentals, his latest CD was inspired by the patients and staff at Children's Hospital in Seattle, where he performs regularly. The recording quality of Soliloquy is professional and intimate, clearly revealing Nelson's emotional connection with his original audience. The melody on &quot;Rondelay&quot; gracefully circles round and round, while &quot;Island Waltz&quot; takes listeners on an easy autumn journey through the San Juans of Puget Sound. This music is equally calming and inspiring. Play Soliloquy in your store to promote this accomplished indie artist and to amp your music sales.

John Nelson is a versatile guitarist whose playing ranges from rock'n'roll to rock-a-billy to the exquisitely gentle contemplative music that fills this, his first solo CD. Nelson has spent a great deal of time in the studio as producer and arranger, working with a remarkable range of musicians. He also spends a good deal of time at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, playing for the patients, their families and the staff that cares for them, and this CD is dedicated to them, calling them the inspiration for his songs. Clearly, there has been a richly loving and emotional interaction between the patients and their caregivers and Nelson's playing. This is one of the most gratifying solo guitar sets in some time - sweet, surprisingly simple, touching - a great companion to nearly any of your daily (or nightly) activities and a delicious listen like letting your eyes dwell on a campfire or waterfall. The word that keeps coming to mind is &quot;care&quot;. You are likely to care deeply for this set.

For Seattle musician John Nelson, life really does inspire art. Every week, with guitar in hand, Nelson performs at the bedside of infants and children at Seattle's Children's Hospital &amp; Regional Medical Center.
&quot;It's really gratifying for me. It's given me the opportunity to give something back, &quot;said Nelson, who has been volunteering at the hospital for 2 1/2 years. &quot;It's very deep to be with people in that environment.&quot;
The experiences at Children's Hospital inspired Nelson's first full-length instrumental recording, &quot;Soliloquy.&quot; The Album, which is mostly acoustic guitar, consists of gentle, sweeping music that is at once calming and inspirational.
The self-taught musician, who has been playing guitar for nearly four decades, is also a composer who brings an array of musical tastes, from rock to world beat, jazz and folk, to his work. Nelson brings music to the people through regular performances at cafes around the Seattle area, including Ravenna Third Place Books and Honey Bear Cafe.</div><br><div class="sans"><img hspace="5" width="100" height="22" ALT="4 out of 5 stars" src="stars4.gif">&nbsp;<b>This CD is exquisite.

and allows the listener to dance, hum, or look inward. No two songs are
alike, and this continuum of surprise compels the listener to appreciate the
entire work. John Nelsons skills as a guitarist, composer and performer
leave the listener more than satisfied. The music travels from folk song
tradition to jazz, gypsy and almost classical. It only enhances the beauty
of each piece to know that much of the music was inspired by children making
their journeys through illness, children John knows and plays for at
Seattles Childrens Orthopedic Hospital. It is a rare, must have collection
by a stunningly talented, insightful musician.</div><br><br></td></tr></table>
