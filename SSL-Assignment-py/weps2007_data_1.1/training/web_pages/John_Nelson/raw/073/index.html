<p><b> Mss: 1<br> 1788-1803 <br> N427 </b></p><p><b>Historical Note:</b></p>
<p> John Nelson, son of Thomas, Jr. and Judith, was born in Middleboro, Massachusetts on November 25, 1737.  As the grandson of one of the early settlers of that town, Nelson was a wealthy man who served as Justice of the Peace as well as selectman for many  years.  After his marriage to Mrs. Hope Rounsevell of Freetown in 1760, the couple moved to a farm located in what is now Lakeville, and in 1800, Nelson built a new house on that property. John Nelson, referred to as Captain Nelson due to his Revolutionary war service in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, died September 11, 1803. <p><b>Scope and Content:</b></p>
<p> The collection contains one volume of accounts, 1788-1803, which details the  sales and purchases of Captain Nelson in the latter years of his life.  Majority of entries concern agricultural produce and farm labor; frequent mention is made of "Cyder" from "Cyder Works."  Names mentioned include John Miller, John Smith, Nathaniel Cole, Nathaniel Thomas, Ezra Thomas,  Elizabeth David, Caleb Turner, Noah Clark, John Pickens, Timothy Wood, Seth Southworth, Nathaniel Foster, John Briggs and Ebenezer Peirce.
<p>
	Scattered throughout volume are pencil sketches, calculations and other notations; these were probably done at a later date by a young girl using the volume as a notebook.
