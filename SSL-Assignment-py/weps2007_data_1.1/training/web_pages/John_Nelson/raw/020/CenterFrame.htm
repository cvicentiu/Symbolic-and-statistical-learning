<IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="8">John Nelson Woodworking cuts and supplies 
cattle bone and pre-ban African ivory for key tops on playing manuals, for guitar 
nuts and saddles, knife handles and other uses. We also refurbish piano and organ 
playing manuals. Begun as a woodworking shop in 1970, we started specializing 
in the production of bone key tops in 1975, and some years later in making and 
refurbishing keyboards. About ten years ago, we added pre-ban African elephant 
ivory to our line. We continue today supplying bone and ivory to the international 
musical instrument trade, and with recovering and restoring keyboards.</DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692"><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="8">	
We manufacture the bone to peerless standards and have always selected our stock 
as a replacement for ivory. Bone is harder than ivory. Both bone and ivory are 
a creamy white and are self bleaching in the ambient ultraviolet light found in 
day-lit rooms. Bleaching with hydrogen peroxide turns both dead white while also 
slightly softening the material, and increasing the porosity. We are the only 
producers of unbleached bone; our process secures good and even color without 
bleaching.</DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="8">Because 
bone is porous it makes an excellent playing surface by providing good traction 
and by wicking away moisture. Over time, bone will become burnished with oil from 
the fingers and continue to present an attractive appearance. Bone will also soak 
up furniture polish, lubricating oil and hand cream which will compromise its 
appearance. To prevent this kind of accident, seal the bone in the beginning with 
butchers wax or water-based lacquer. Few of our customers have ever thought they 
needed to seal the bone, however.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="8">	
There are many plastic key tops on the market. They wear well; some are handsome; 
a few attempt to provide the traction and absorptive capability of bone and ivory. 
A large supplier recently touted its new manmade product while denigrating bone, 
which it has supplied for years, in a self-fulfilling prophecy -- market indifferent 
material and see how soon it will show its true character. Every bone plate we 
sell is scrutinized, given a top and a front and cut to exclude bony characteristics, 
just the way we get out wood by cutting around knots and checks. Further, we inspect 
the interior, which you may do by placing a light behind, and reject any greasy 
or coarse material.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR> <TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692"><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="8"> 
We enjoy fixing nice things; we bring to bear our experience in keyboard making 
to our keyboard recovering, ivory and sharp resurfacing and replacement, rebushing, 
repinning, releathering and general repairs. We like the quiet handwork, a respite 
from machine operation, and will return your playing manual to you fit, balanced 
and lovely. </DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692">&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR> <TD HEIGHT="4" WIDTH="692"><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="8">Sincerely,</DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="31" WIDTH="692"><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="8">Jack
