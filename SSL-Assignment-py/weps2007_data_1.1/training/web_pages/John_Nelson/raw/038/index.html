<center> John Nelson Key, sometime in 1862</center>
<P>
John Nelson Key, from Emanuel County, Georgia, joined up with his
nephews, sons of his brother Burrell Kea, also from Enamuel
County. The nephews were named Dennis Kea, James Kea and Wesley
Kea. 
<P>
Burrell had changed his family name from Key to Kea after he
found the name carved on an old chair from England. The rest of
the family kept their name as Key.
<P>
According to the muster roll of Company G, 32d Regiment, Georgia
Volunteer Infantry, Army of Tennessee, C. S. A., John Nelson Key
was appointed 5th Sergeant on May 7th, 1862. (Daryl - see below -
feels certain that John's brother Warren also joined and was
later killed in action.)
<P>
Sgt. John Key died at at Battery Harrison near Savannah, Ga.
August 15, 1862, but not from combat. Like two-thirds of the
soldiers who died in the Civil War, John died of other causes.
<P>
Sgt. John Nelson Key, of the Confederate army, was home on
furlough when a daughter was born on August 1, 1862. According to
Aunt Callie Pollette Kindon, (Key family) when he took the train back
to Savannah, he rode in the open and was exposed to a rain storm.
He became ill and died on August 15, 1862 of pneumonia.
<P>
Although John Nelson Key had been dead almost two years when the
Battle of Olustee was fought, his photograph is one of the few we
have of members of the 32nd Georgia and is included here for that
reason. The Keys (and Keas) were typical of the men who joined
this regiment early in the war.
<P>
According to the muster roll of the 32nd Regiment Georgia
Volunteer Infantry, 
Wesley Kea, John's cousin, was appointed 4th Sergeant of Co. E,
5th Regiment Ga. State Troops on October 12, 1861. He mustered
out in May, 1862 and enlisted as a private in Co. G, 32d Regiment
Ga. Inf. May 7, 1862. 
<P>
Wesley Kea was admitted to C.S.A. General Military Hospital #4,
at Wilmington, N. C. with fever, January 5, 1863. He returned to
duty January 21, or 31, 1863. No futher record of his activities
while in service is available.
