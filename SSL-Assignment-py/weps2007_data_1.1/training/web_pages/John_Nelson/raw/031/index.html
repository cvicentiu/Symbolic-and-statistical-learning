        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoSubtitle">Life and Writings</p>
        <p class="MsoSubtitle">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Early leader among 
        the Plymouth Brethren and developer of dispensational premillennialism, 
        John Darby (1800-1882) invested his life in strengthening the saints as 
        they gathered simply &quot;to His name&quot; and awaited their Lord's any-moment 
        return. Born in London of wealthy Irish parents, Darby received his 
        middle name from Admiral Lord Nelson. Upon returning to Ireland in 1815, 
        he entered Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1819 as a classical 
        gold medallist. Although called to the Irish Chancery Bar in 1822, he 
        gave up a career in law after only one year to enter religious ministry. 
        After a prolonged spiritual struggle leading to his conversion, Darby 
        was ordained as a deacon in 1825 and as a priest in the Church of 
        England in 1826. He had an unusually fruitful evangelistic ministry 
        among Catholics in his parish of County Wicklow, Ireland.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">From 1827 to 1833, 
        Darby's ecclesiology and eschatology were formed. Disenchanted with the 
        state-church religion. Darby addressed in his earliest writing the 
        heavenly nature of the church and the need for it to be unencumbered 
        with earthly things. He soon discovered a group of like-minded people 
        meeting in Dublin for Bible study, worship, and breaking of bread 
        without ecclesiastical ritual and hierarchy. By 1831, he had left the 
        Church of England and joined others in Plymouth, England, who were 
        opposed to denominationalism, one-man ministry, and church formalism. 
        From this time on, Darby's life would be inextricable from the 
        influential Plymouth Brethren movement. The Powerscourt Conferences from 
        1831- 33 would provide the context in which Darby's eschatology would be 
        aligned consistently with his ecclesiology. Afterward his innovations in 
        both fields of theology would be widely accepted throughout the Brethren 
        movement, yielding a new perspective and interpretation of Scripture 
        that would be known as dispensationalism.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Darby traveled, 
        taught, and wrote extensively from 1832 to 1845. He worked in 
        Switzerland and France from 1838 to 1845, and soon afterward began to 
        write in French what would be called in the English translation his <i>
        Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>. He did not finish these five 
        volumes until 1865. His chief aim was to give the reader a guide to 
        clearly apprehend the difference between the church called to heavenly 
        places and the governments of this world with which the Jews play a 
        central role in God's ways. Darby skillfully explained the &quot;argument&quot; of 
        each book by showing how various sections of them relate to the main 
        point. His sense for the historical and developmental dimensions of 
        &quot;biblical theology&quot; stands out in his <i>Synopsis</i>.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In 1845, the Great 
        Schism over B. W. Newton's differing views concerning the &quot;secret 
        rapture&quot; and his supposed lapse into clericalism brought tremendous 
        dissension among the Brethren assemblies. Combined with the Bethesda 
        Question (in 1848, George Muller and Darby disagreed as to the 
        interrelationship of assemblies over matters of discipline), the Schism 
        would leave the Brethren from this time forward divided into Exclusive 
        and Open Brethren.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Darby would remain 
        the dominant voice among the Exclusives for the next 30 years. During 
        this time, both groups would be deeply involved in missions, although 
        the Exclusives seemed to be more occupied with, truth for the believer 
        while the Opens were given to evangelizing the lost. Between 1853 and 
        the time of his death, Darby himself would make at least three trips to 
        Germany, spend considerable time in France, visit Italy, New Zealand, 
        and the West Indies. He preached fluently in both French and German. 
        During one span of time (1859-74), he made seven visits to Canada and 
        the U.S.A. Amid his extensive teaching tours, he found rime to translate 
        the New Testament into English, French, and German, and he assisted in 
        translating the Old Testament into both French and German.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The <i>Letters of 
        J. N. Darby</i> comprise three large volumes addressing a wide range of 
        topics. Most of his papers and articles are gathered in thirty-four 
        volumes of <i>The Collected Works of J. N. Darby</i>, edited by his 
        longtime associate and friend William Kelly. In general, <i>Collected 
        Works</i> is organized chronologically within a volume, and thematically 
        from volume to volume. Subject headings include &quot;Ecclesiastical&quot; (vols. 
        1,4, 14,20), &quot;Prophetic&quot; (vols. 2,5,8, 11), &quot;Doctrinal&quot;(vols.3, 7, 
        10,15,18,22,23,29,31), &quot;Apologetic&quot; (vols. 6. 9), &quot;Evangelical&quot; (vols. 
        12, 21), &quot;Critical&quot; (vol. 13), &quot;Practical&quot; (vols. 16, 17), &quot;Expository&quot; 
        (vols. 19, 24-28, 30), and &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; (vols. 32- 34). An excellent 
        general index volume aids in researching topics not only throughout 
        Darby's <i>Letters</i> and <i>Collected Works</i>, but also throughout 
        the two volumes of <i>Miscellaneous Writings of J. N. Darby</i> 
        (actually vols. 4 and 5 of his miscellaneous writings since vols. 1-3 
        are the last three volumes of the <i>Collected Works</i>), seven volumes 
        of <i>Notes and Comments on Scripture</i>, and <i>Notes and Jottings 
        from Various Meetings with J. N. Darby</i>. The last volume seems to be 
        nuggets preserved by students and listeners. A small volume of poetry, 
        meditations, and hymns entitled <i>Spiritual Songs</i> and Darby's <i>
        Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i> are not included in the index.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoSubtitle">Eschatology</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Acknowledged father 
        of modem dispensational premillennialism. Darby is remembered especially 
        for his recalling the church to expectancy for its rapture at the return 
        of the Lord before Daniel's Seventieth Week. To a large degree, his 
        eschatology flows out of his ecclesiology which underwent radical change 
        between 1827 and 1831. To understand this change, Darby's background at 
        Trinity College, Dublin, and the state of the Anglican church at that 
        time must be seen.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">While at Trinity 
        College, Darby came under the influence of theologians like Regius 
        Professor Richard Graves who was an advocate for the Jewish people in 
        the British empire. Graves, a postmillennialist, believed that through 
        the conversion of Israel and their return to their ancient homeland, the 
        millennial era would be ushered in. A Gentile &quot;parenthesis&quot; had existed 
        since the rejection of Jesus as Messiah by Israel. Old Testament 
        promises to Abraham and his seed concerning their homeland, however, 
        were unconditional. Prophesied blessings on the Jewish people could be 
        fulfilled soon by zealous missionary activity among them. Darby took 
        into the ministry this respect for the Old Testament vision of a future 
        for national Israel.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">As a young parish 
        priest, Darby became disillusioned with the state-church system which 
        took advantage of governmental sanction. His belief that the church as 
        the body of Christ was to be a heavenly people and not court earthly 
        favors was formulated by 1827. During the same year, an accidental fall 
        from his horse forced him into a lengthy convalescence and gave him much 
        time alone with God and His word. Isaiah 32 convinced him that there was 
        to be a future economy in which Israel would enjoy earthly blessings. 
        Not at all like the present heavenly blessings he was conscious of 
        because of his union with Christ. Dispensational distinctives were 
        taking shape in his thinking.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Powerscourt 
        Conferences of 1831 to 1833 most probably moved Darby from his earlier 
        historicist premillennialism to futurist premillennialism. The 
        transition from the present church dispensation to the millennia] 
        kingdom in which Israel had center stage under Christ's rule was 
        supplied by seeing Daniel's Seventieth Week as yet future. Before that 
        time the church would be raptured to heavenly glory, while during that 
        time God would bring into existence a remnant of Israel who would 
        experience deliverance from their enemies at the return of Christ to the 
        earth. By his own testimony, Darby's dispensational premillennial 
        eschatology was fully formed by 1833.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">For Darby, a 
        dispensation is an economy, any order of things that God has arranged on 
        the earth. The primary characteristics of a dispensation include 
        governmental administration, responsibility, and revelation to fulfill 
        both. Secondary characteristics include testing, failure, and judgment. 
        When a group fails the test to exercise their responsibility given to 
        them by God, judgment falls and ends the dispensation. Given these 
        parameters, Darby saw three &quot;worlds&quot; or ages: from Adam until Noah's 
        flood, from Noah until the renovation of the heavens and earth by fire 
        at the end of the millennium, and the eternal state. Properly speaking, 
        Darby did not think that any dispensations existed in the first world. 
        God just left the race to itself. Also the eternal state is not a 
        dispensation. Thus only from Noah through the millennium could 
        dispensations be distinguished. Darby traced eight dispensations as 
        follows: (1) Noah. (2) Abraham. (3) Israel under law (prophet), (4) 
        Israel under the priesthood. (5) Israel under the kings, (6) Gentiles 
        (from Nebuchadnezzar to the Antichrist), (7) church or Christian 
        (although he hesitates to call the church in its heavenly perspective a 
        dispensation), and (8) Millennium or kingdom. Darby's order of end-time 
        events may be grouped as follows: (1) the rapture and first 
        resurrection, (2) postrapture events in heaven, (3) postrapture events 
        on earth, (4) the millennial kingdom, (5) postmillennial events, and (6) 
        the eternal state.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">1. The Rapture 
        occurs before the final time of trial to come upon the earth. The church 
        must already be with Christ in heaven to be able to appear with Him at 
        His glorious return. Darby hesitated to call the Rapture secret, 
        although he believed the time of its occurrence was unknown, yet 
        possible at any moment. The first resurrection of the just coincides 
        with the Rapture. Thus all those who have died in faith from both the 
        Old Testament and New Testament eras will be raptured with the living 
        church saints. Although all who have a resurrection body will be related 
        in some way to the New Jerusa1cm, flashy called only the church the 
        bride so as to give it the chief position among those glorified.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">2. After the 
        Rapture, several things transpire in heaven. First. Satan is cast out of 
        heaven to the earth. Then the saints will experience the judgment seat 
        of Christ in preparation for the marriage of the Lamb. The latter event 
        will take place after the judgment of Babylon.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">3. Events on earth 
        after the Rapture relate to Daniel's Seventieth Week. At times Darby 
        spoke of this seven-year period as entirely future, but at other times 
        as only three and one-half years remaining for the future (the first 
        three and one-half years being the earthly ministry of Christ). Some 
        future time of trial was necessary after the Rapture to prepare a Jewish 
        remnant that would be delivered by Messiah's personal return to the 
        earth. During that time, the Beast would arise as the secular head of 
        evil imperial government, and the False Prophet would arise as the 
        Antichrist, the spiritual head of evil religious energy. The Day of the 
        Lord is at the appearing of Christ at the end of the Tribulation period. 
        Armageddon ends the Beast's and Antichrist's power, and Satan himself 
        will be bound soon after. Next the land of Israel is cleansed. Then the 
        judgment of the living on earth takes place to determine who among them 
        will enter the millennial kingdom. After a short time of peace and 
        security in their land, Israel will be attacked by Gog (= Russia) whom 
        the Lord utterly destroys.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">4. In the 
        millennial kingdom, the land promises given to Abraham will be fulfilled 
        for a restored Israel. Messiah delivers the remnant, which becomes the 
        blessed nation by destroying all its enemies. Afterward Israel will 
        occupy the chief place among the nations on earth in Messiah's kingdom, 
        just as the church as the bride of Christ will occupy the chief place 
        among those resurrected in the New Jerusalem.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">5. Events after the 
        Millennium include the final revolt of Satan, the second resurrection, 
        and the Great White Throne judgment of the unbelieving dead. Darby 
        believed in the eternal conscious punishment of the lost in the lake of 
        fire.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">6. The eternal 
        state will bring an end to Israel's special position above the nations 
        of the millennial kingdom. But there will eternally be a distinction 
        between the church and the earthly people in its eternal state format. 
        &quot;The tabernacle of God&quot; (for Darby, meaning the church in Rev. 21:2-3) 
        would be &quot;with men&quot; (the earth inhabiters without national distinction). 
        Thus the church will have special distinction in eternity since &quot;to Him 
        be glory in the church throughout all ages (Eph. 3:21) refers to a 
        relationship that persists forever. Two peoples of God, an earthly and a 
        heavenly, will be eternally distinct simply because saved humans in 
        natural bodies will be distinguished from the saved who have 
        resurrection bodies in the eternal state.</span></p>
