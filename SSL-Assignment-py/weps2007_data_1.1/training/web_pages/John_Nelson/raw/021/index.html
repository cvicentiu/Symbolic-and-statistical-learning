<font class="ptext">Through John Nelson Darby and the Brethren Assemblies the Lord was able to obtain a level of recovery not achieved before. Their early years from the mid-1820's to the mid-1840's were years of oneness, growth in Christ, and recovery of many important truths, and the building up of many local assemblies (churches) through the able ministry of many gifted brothers who had been laid hold of by the Lord for His purpose.

</table>Together with all the believers, these brothers saw many of the truths concerning the Lord's Body and were enabled by the Lord to practice them in a simple, scriptural manner. Unfortunately, in 1845 major difficulties arose and the precious oneness of the believers was eventually lost.</p>

<p class="ptext">D. M. Panton described them as a movement of brothers whose significance was &#147;far greater than the Reformation.&#148; Griffith Thomas had this tribute to make: &#147;Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth.&#148;
The biographer of H. A. Ironside, E. Schuyler English, said, &#147;The Church owes a great debt to the Brethren. Many of its early leaders...were the Spirit's instruments to search out and open the truths in the unchanging Scriptures in a new way&#148; (p. 83). Harry A. Ironside himself remarked, &#147;Whether among those who know the brothers or those who do not know the brothers, all those who know God have received help from the brothers directly or indirectly.&#148; Watchman Nee and Witness Lee were among those that received much help.</p>
