      <b> STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN NELSON</b>
    </CENTER>
    </font> 
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. Thank you, Senator, very much. It's an honor for me to be here. For 
  the record, my name is John Nelson, and I'm wearing several hats today. I am 
  a practicing obstetrician gynecologist, which is how I first came in touch with 
  this subject, unfortunately. I'm also the Deputy Director of the Utah Department 
  of Health on a part-time basis right now, and of course a parent and husband 
  as well. I think that the scope of this problem has been pretty well laid out 
  for you. </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. And you're also one of the leaders of the American Medical Association; 
  is that right? </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. Well, thank you. It does not surprise me and it does not surprise most 
  of us that you would be the kind of person that would lead this kind of effort, 
  and I thank you for your sensitivity as well as your courage to bring forth 
  this very difficult issue. It's difficult for all of us to talk about. The statistics 
  are overwhelming. The amazing part is probably 37 percent or so females who 
  come to the emergency room are there directly or indirectly as a result of abuse 
  of some sort. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to females between 
  the age of 15 and 40. </font>
  <p> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. Do you think it might be higher than that? </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. Yes; I do. </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. You think that's really a low percentage? </font>
  <p> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. There's no question that there are people coming in for things that 
  are not verbally that. If someone comes in with a broken bone, the first thing-- 
  </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. And a lot of women are afraid to say. </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. Absolutely. There's no question. And it's also very difficult, I might 
  add, as a physician to ask those kinds of questions. </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. Yes. </font>
  <p> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. I point out to you something that has been submitted to you. Dr. George 
  Lundberg, who was in the Journal of the American Medical Association, asked 
  for articles a year ago and got several hundred, which have now been complied 
  after having been proofread very carefully. One entire issue of JAMA was on 
  the battered female, a very impressive thing to read. I think my concern today 
  and the focus I'd like to give you-- </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator 
  HATCH. JAMA being the Journal of the American Medical Association? </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. 
  NELSON. Yes. The thing I would like to point out today is that this issue, in 
  my opinion as well as the opinion of Dr. C. Everett Koop, a former Surgeon General, 
  of Dr. Lundberg who was the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, 
  that this is a public health issue as well as the other things you've heard 
  about today and, therefore, lends itself to epidemiological research and the 
  public health model. I think that's something we need to keep in mind very clearly. 
  </font>
    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, 
      also, as we go through this tremendous change in health system reform, this 
      will not be lost in that large millet. We certainly hope that there will 
      be an increased knowledge on the part of the general public, the clergy, 
      medicine, law, the legislature and law enforcement officers. </font> 
    <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
  simple example to show you how difficult this problem is. Physicians tend to 
  be able or feel that they're able to solve things. We have the story of a young 
  woman who was in a terrible situation and was told by her physician repeatedly 
  just to leave. She finally did leave, and after having gone across seven States, 
  changing her name and so forth, one morning sitting at the breakfast nook with 
  her 18-month-old child, a gunshot rang out hitting the child squarley in the 
  head and killing him. The domestic violence perpetrator, in fact, was her husband 
  who said well, if I can't have the kids neither can you, the point being that 
  this goes on and on and continues on. </font>
  <p> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
  of the things we're trying to do is come up with some answers. These people 
  who are victims and admit they're victims, 68 percent want to tell their physician. 
  Unfortunately, physicians are not skilled in this area. They don't document 
  it, they don't ask the right questions we don't know how to ask the questions, 
  so we're trying to do that. In the Department of Health we're trying to bring 
  together the local health officers so that we can use the existing resources 
  to help us get where we need to get. We hope to be able to use organizations 
  that are already in place, not make new ones, thereby costing more money. We 
  also are trying to do a couple of things. There's so much to do, but we're trying 
  to categorize and chronicle in a scientific way the victims of domestic violence. 
  But more importantly from a medical standpoint, we are attempting to teach the 
  young physicians, the students and the residents, how to ask these difficult 
  questions. Example: If I were to ask a patient "Have you been raped?" the likely 
  answer might be no. If I ask the question &quot;Have you been forced to have 
  sexual relations against your will?&quot; a more likely answer would be yes. 
  But if I were to ask "Are you frigtened to go home?" or in some other general 
  way asked the question correctly, you can appreciate that if we ask the question 
  correctly we're more likely to get the answer. </font>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
  also want to point out to you the tremendous work that's currently being done 
  by the American Medical Association and the Utah Medical Association auxiliaries. 
  Among the things that these wonderful people are trying to do are to make money 
  available for volunteer coordinators to start hospital programs to support a 
  team where physicians can help referred patients. We also want to mention that 
  we recognize these things are in all strains of society. </font>
  <p> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, 
  as I conclude, I'd like to point out that this is not just the problem of other 
  people. This is a problem of all people, Senator. This goes across all social 
  or economic stratum, all walks of life, all races, everything you could think 
  of demographically it goes across them stratum. We hope, therefore, that we're 
  going to be able to come up with a meaningful way, along with your bill, to 
  make sure that we recognize the problem, find it much earlier and prevent it. 
  The goal obviously is to detect, if we could, to whom these things may occur 
  and prevent them before they occur. I thank you very kindly for your attention 
  and I'll answer any questions. </font> </blockquote>
