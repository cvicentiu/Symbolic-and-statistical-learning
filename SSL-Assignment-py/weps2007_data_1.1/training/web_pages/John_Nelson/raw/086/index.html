<H3> Biosystematics, Floristics, Plant Geography </h3>


     Plant taxonomy in South Carolina has had a  long  and  well-
documented  history,  and  for  a  number of reasons, is far from
over.  Questions remain concerning our knowledge of  the  roughly
3000  species  of  vascular plants that originally occurred here.
Of these, many have been replaced by "modern" species  that  have
effectively supplanted the original taxa.  Beyond the fascinating
issues of plant distribution and geography, various plant  groups
have  complicated  taxonomic relationships remaining to be unraveled.<p>

     Dr. Nelson has investigated  the  relationships  of  eastern
North  American representatives of the genus <i>Stachys</i>, a member of
the mint family.  Within this group, a  number  are  problematic,
forming complicated species groups with overlapping morphologies.
Various features of ecological and anatomical specialization have
proven  useful  in understanding this enigmatic group.  Both herbarium
studies and field work have been crucial  to  this  understanding.<p>

     We are also involved in projects concerning landscape history  of
our area. Involvement in floristic studies on a state-wide
basis have elucidated  some  of  these  distributions,  and  have
helped  fill  in  the existing botanical gaps.  At the same time,
new questions have emerged concerning  puzzling  range  distributions
not before thought to exist.  Recently, an enormous population  of  the
federally  endangered  "rough-leaved  loosestrife"
(<i>Lysimachia asperulaefolia</i>) was discovered in a bog at Fort Jackson,
near Columbia: this  plant,  although  recorded  from  South
Carolina  about  1880,  had  not  been seen anywhere in the state
since then.<p>
