<p>Few today who would identify themselves as Fundamentalists have ever heard of John
Nelson Darby or the Plymouth Brethren. Yet as Ernest R. Sandeen correctly observes in <em>The
Roots of Fundamentalism</em>, </p>


<blockquote>
  <p>much of the thought and attitudes of those who are known as Fundamentalists can be
  mirrored in the teachings of this man.<i>1</p>
</blockquote>
</i>


<p>Darby flourished at a time when the winds of higher criticism were sweeping through the
established churches of the British Isles. Christians firmly rooted in orthodoxy were
appalled to see unregenerate clergy not only paid out of state coffers, but openly
attacking the inspiration and authority of the Word of God. A general disenchantment and
despair over the state of the organized church caused many to withdraw and seek fellowship
elsewhere.</p>



<p>A number of movements sprang up to bid for the moral high ground of biblical
Christianity. One of these was the Bible society movement begun in 1804 with the
establishment of the British and Foreign Bible Society in London by a group of
theologically conservative Anglicans. Another was the ill-fated anti-liberalism Oxford
movement which itself became entangled in an anti-Reformation Romanism. Yet another
reaction against the established church, which was to leave its important but largely
anonymous signature upon the Fundamentalist movement of a later time, was the movement
begun by the &quot;brethren&quot; who were to eventually become known for their meetings
at Plymouth. The chief architect and theologian of this movement was the Irish clergyman,
J. N. Darby.</p>
<b>


<p ALIGN="CENTER">DARBY'S LIFE</p>
</b>


<p>John Nelson Darby, namesake of family friend and famed British admiral, Lord Nelson,
was born in London of Irish parents on November 18, 1800. Ireland furnished the backdrop
for his earliest years of development and education. In 1819 at the age of eighteen, Darby
graduated from Trinity College Dublin as a Classical Medalist.</p>


<p>Brilliant, gifted, and with all the right connections, Darby had been groomed for and
was practically assured a successful career in law. But a deep spiritual struggle gripped
the budding young barrister in his eighteenth year and caused him to abandon that
profession after only one year of practice between 1822 and 1823. Darby's spiritual
odyssey lasted until 1825 when he received ordination as deacon in the Church of England.
The following year, he was elevated to the priesthood and assigned a curacy in remote
County Wicklow, Ireland.</p>


<p>Taking up residence in a peasant's cottage on a bog, Darby covered the great untamed
expanse of his ecclesiastical responsibility on horseback in the manner of John Wesley.
His gentleness of spirit and saintly bearing and conduct quickly earned him a place in the
hearts of his poor parishioners. So committed was Darby to the instruction of the
peasantry in the Word of God that he was seldom found at his own humble dwelling before
midnight. His labors did not go unrewarded. Although he expended most of his modest wages
and personal inheritance on the local schools and charities, by Darby's own account
Catholics were &quot;becoming protestants at the rate of 600 to 800 a week.&quot;2 Darby's
standard of reward and gain was always in terms of souls won for the kingdom, never silver
added to the purse.</p>


<p>For some time the young circuit-riding cleric had been troubled by the condition of the
established church, but his demanding duties had prevented any decisive action. He was to
receive time for undisturbed reflection on the issue, however, when his horse bolted
during one journey through the parish, throwing its rider with tremendous force against a
doorjamb. The ensuing lengthy convalescence from the required surgery in Dublin, served as
an incubator for Darby's discontent.</p>


<p>Darby says, </p>


<blockquote>
  <p>During my solitude, conflicting thoughts increased; but much exercise of soul had the
  effect of causing the scriptures to gain complete ascendancy over me. I had always owned
  them to be the Word of God . . . the careful reading of the <i>Acts</i> afforded me a
  practical picture of the early church; which made me feel deeply the contrast with its
  actual present state; though still, as ever beloved by God.<i>3</p>
</blockquote>
</i>


<p>After only twenty-seven months with the Church of England and thoroughly dissatisfied
with what he viewed as rampant Erastianism and clericalism, Darby sought fellowship and
ministry outside the established church.</p>


<p>Eventually, Darby made the acquaintance of a group of like-minded believers, members of
the Church of England in Dublin, and met with them for prayer and Bible study during the
winter of 1827-28. It was this group which would later become known as the Plymouth
Brethren. The two guiding principles of the movement were to be the breaking of bread
every Lord's Day, and ministry based upon the call of Christ rather than the ordination of
man. While Darby was not the founder of this group, he quickly emerged as its spiritual
leader and dominant force.</p>


<p>By 1840, the Plymouth movement had grown to 800 strong and would reach more than 1200
within the next five years. Even though Darby disliked denominational labels, preferring
rather the simple biblical designation &quot;brethren,&quot; it was perhaps inevitable
that these &quot;brethren&quot; who met at Plymouth, should become known as the
&quot;Plymouth Brethren.&quot;</p>


<p>Many other Brethren groups formed in Britain and subsequently in other parts of the
world. As a result of his extensive travels, Darby himself was responsible for the spread
of Brethren doctrine to other countries. He made several trips to preach and teach in
Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Holland. Between 1859 and 1874, Darby made six
trips to the United States and Canada where he ministered in all the major cities and in
some of the smaller ones as well. Included also in Darby's itinerary were visits to the
West Indies and New Zealand.</p>


<p>Wherever Darby went, he never tired of expounding his views on the doctrine of the
church and future things. He was convinced both that the organized church was in a state
of ruin and that Christ's return to rapture the saints and establish the millennial
kingdom was imminent. While Darby's call for a radical response to the apostate condition
of the church was met with relative indifference, his teachings on eschatological themes
were heartily embraced and provided much of the substance for the Bible conference
movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But more than any one
doctrine, it was Darby and the Brethren's fundamental orthodoxy that appealed to Bible
believing Christians everywhere.</p>
<b>


<p ALIGN="CENTER">DARBY'S CHARACTER</p>
</b>


<p>Any portraiture of Darby the man must be painted in sharp black and white tones, never
in shades of gray. He was a man of incredible intensity. First and foremost, he was
intensely committed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. It was his only love and all-consuming
passion. He cared for little that this world had to offer. Though meticulous in personal
cleanliness, for example, Darby wore only simple clothing and those to the point of
shabbiness. It is said that on one occasion while he slept, some kindly friends seized the
opportunity to substitute new clothing for old. Upon waking, Darby donned the new apparel
without remark or even apparent notice.</p>


<p>Darby was kind and humble in nature and his compassion and generosity towards the poor
was without bounds. He observed that </p>


<blockquote>
  <p>Christ preferred the poor; ever since I have been converted so have I. Let those who
  like society better have it. If I ever get into it . . . I return sick at heart. I go to
  the poor; I find the same evil nature as in the rich, but I find this difference: the
  rich, and those who keep their comforts and their society, judge and measure how much of
  Christ they can take and keep without committing themselves; the poor, how much of Christ
  they can have to comfort them in their sorrows. That, unworthy as I am, is where I am at
  home and happy.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Darby in no way felt intellectually ill-equipped for cultivated society, it was just
that given the choice, he rejected it all in preference for the cross.4 </p>


<p>Kindly in disposition and humble in spirit though Darby was, his absolute devotion to
the Word of God and demand for unflinching fidelity to its truth, as he understood it,
made him ready prey for controversy. His limitless patience with the honest ignorance of
the poor and unlearned was legendary. But so was his wrath against those among the well
educated who played fast and loose with the truth of the gospel of Christ.</p>


<p>A full twenty-five years after one &quot;heterodox teacher&quot; had felt the brunt of
Darby's indignation, he was to write, &quot;J.N.D. writes with a pen in one hand and a
thunderbolt in the other.&quot; But as Darby's biographer, W. G. Turner points out,
&quot;it was only fundamental error which roused his deepest grief and indignation, his
patience with honest blunderers being proverbial.&quot;5 </p>


<p>If ever the epithet, &quot;fighting Fundamentalist&quot; applied to anyone, it applied
to J. N. Darby. At the same time, it is true that Darby derived no pleasure from
controversy and often expressed his love for the object of his more potent polemics. But
in his view, faced with a choice between peace on the one hand and truth on the other,
there could be no alternative but to defend the truth.</p>


<p>Wherever Darby went, whether peasant's home or hallowed halls of Oxford, his nobleness
of character, keenness of mind, dedication to Christ, and commanding presence made him the
focus of attention. The great Bible teacher and preacher, G. Campbell Morgan recounts as
one of the &quot;cherished recollections&quot; of his boyhood his encounter with Darby who
had come to visit his father. &quot;He vividly recalls the almost reverential awe that lay
upon him in the presence of that truly great man, and how the awe gave place and the
reverence remained, when the visitor spoke kindly to him about his studies.&quot;6</p>
<b>


<p ALIGN="CENTER">DARBY'S DOCTRINE</p>
</b>


<p>Darby is called by many the father of modern dispensational theology, a theology made
popular first by the <i>Scofield Reference Bible</i>7and more recently by the<i> Ryrie
Study Bible</i>. It is a theology that has gained wide influence through the publications
and educational efforts of institutions like Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible
Institute. Yet while Darby is the center of almost every controversy over the origin of
this theological system, his works are little known and seldom read. This is true among
the critics and champions of dispensational theology alike. This neglect is unfortunate,
for Darby is credited with much of the theological content of the Fundamentalist movement.
There is little doubt too, that Darby had a tremendous part in the systematization and
promotion of dispensational theology.</p>



<p>Today, however, Darby's theological distinctives have virtually been reduced to his
doctrine of the church in ruins, the premillennial return of Christ--with special emphasis
upon Israel and the church's role in that kingdom age--and the rapture of the church. As
important as these doctrines are in Darby's theology, they were but an outgrowth of other
doctrines which must be considered the bedrock of his and the Brethren's teaching. It is
the bedrock upon which orthodox Christianity has stood since Pentecost and upon which
Fundamentalists made their stand shortly after the turn of the century.</p>
<i><b>


<p>Inspiration and Infallibility of Scripture</b></i> Darby was unswerving in his belief
that the Bible was the inspired, infallible Word of God, absolutely authoritative8 and
faithfully transmitted from the original autographs.9 If the world itself were to
disappear and be annihilated, asserts Darby, &quot;and the word of God alone remained as
an invisible thread over the abyss, my soul would trust in it. After deep exercise of soul
I was brought by grace to feel I could entirely. I never found it fail me since. I have
often failed; but I never found it failed me.&quot;</p>


<p>Once questioned as to whether he might not allow that some parts of the New Testament
may have had only temporary significance, Darby retorted, &quot;'No! every word, depend
upon it, is from the Spirit and is for eternal service!'&quot; Darby felt compelled to
affirm his fidelity to the Word of God because &quot;In these days especially . . . the
authority of His written word is called in question on every side . . . &quot;10</p>
<i><b>


<p>Deity and Virgin Birth of Christ</b></i> On the deity of Christ, Darby is no less
compromising than he is on the place of Scripturein the believer's life. &quot;The great
truth of the divinity of Jesus, that He is God,&quot; says Darby, &quot;is written all
through scripture with a sunbeam, but written to faith. I cannot hesitate in seeing the <i>Son</i>,
the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the First and the Last, Alpha and Omega, and thus it
shines all through. But He fills all things, and His manhood, true, proper manhood, as
true, proper Godhead, is as precious to me, and makes me know God, and so indeed only as
the other, He is 'the true God and eternal life.'&quot;11 If Christ is not God, concludes
Darby, then &quot;I do not know Him, have not met Him, nor know what He is.&quot;12 As one
of the truths connected with the person and work of Christ, Darby cites the

&quot;miraculous birth of the Saviour, who was absolutely without sin . . .&quot;13</p>
<i><b>


<p>Substitutionary Atonement</b></i> Just as the doctrine of the deity of Christ is
written all through the Bible, Darby maintains that the propitiation secured by the
sacrificial death of Christ &quot;is a doctrine interwoven with all Scripture, forms one
of the bases of Christianity, is the sole ground of remission--and there is none without
shedding blood--and that by which Christ has made peace; Col. 1:20.&quot;14</p>


<p>Darby is convinced that without the atoning work of Christ, man must bear the guilt of
his sin, and remain at a distance from God without knowledge of Him or of His love. But
thankfully that is not the case, for as Darby points out, &quot;There is death in
substitution--He 'bore our sins in his own body on the tree'--'died for our sins according
to the scriptures' . ..&quot;15</p>
<i><b>


<p>Resurrection of Christ</b></i> For Darby, &quot;the Person of Christ regarded as
risen,&quot; is the pivot around which &quot;all the truths found in the word
revolve.&quot;16 &quot;Many have, perhaps, been able, in looking at the Church's hope in
Christ,&quot; says Darby, &quot;to see the importance of the doctrine of the resurrection.

But the more we search the Scriptures, the more we perceive, in this doctrine, the
fundamental truth of the gospel--that truth which gives to redemption its character, and
to all other truths their real power.&quot; It is the victory of Christ over death which
gives the certainty of salvation.17 It is the resurrection, asserts Darby, which
&quot;leaves behind, in the tomb, all that could condemn us, and ushers the Lord into that
new world of which he is the perfection, the Head, and the glory.&quot;18 Consequently,
this doctrine characterized apostolic preaching.19</p>
<i><b>


<p>Return of Christ</b></i> Darby believed that it was essential that the church have a
right hope. That hope he understood to be the second coming of Christ. At his coming,
Darby maintained, Christ would take the saints to glory with Him, to become the bride, the
wife of the Lamb.20</p>


<p>Darby insists that &quot;Nothing is more prominently brought forward in the New
Testament than the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; He points out that it was
the promise of Christ's return which was first offered to the sorrowing disciples as they
witnessed the ascension of their Lord as recorded in Acts 1:11. Furthermore, says Darby,
&quot;It was not at all a strange thing--immediately after conversion to the living
God--'to wait for his Son from heaven, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to
come.'&quot;21</p>


<p>In light of the foregoing, John F. Walvoord, president emeritus of Dallas Theological
Seminary, is certainly correct in saying that &quot;Much of the Truth promulgated by
fundamental Christians today had its rebirth in the movement known as the 'Plymouth
Brethren.'&quot;22</p>
<b>


<p ALIGN="CENTER">DARBY'S INFLUENCE</p>
</b>


<p>It should be evident from the foregoing that there is a distinct connection between the
doctrines of the Brethren and the Fundamentalists who rose to challenge modernism shortly
before and especially after the turn of the century. Well before publication of <i>TheFundamentals:
A Testimony of Truth</i> in 1909, the Brethren were proclaiming the same basic truths of
Scripture and staunchly defending them against all comers. The very character of Brethren
fellowship and beliefs is such that to entertain liberal doctrines would destroy the
movement altogether.</p>


<p>Many of the greatest Fundamentalist leaders of the past have openly acknowledged their
indebtedness to the teachings and ministry of Darby and the Brethren. After securing the
writings of C. H. Mackintosh, the man most responsible for popularizing Darby's works, D.
L.Moody said, &quot;if they could not be replaced, [I] would rather part with my entire
library, excepting my Bible, than with these writings. They have been to me a very key to
the Scriptures.&quot;23</p>


<p>A. C. Gaebelein, contributor to <i>The Fundamentals</i> and one of the most potent
influences on the life and doctrine of C. I. Scofield, says of Darby and other Brethren
writers, &quot;I found in his writings, in the works of William Kelly, Mcintosh
[Mackintosh], F. W. Grant, Bellett, and others the soul food I needed. I esteem these men
next to the Apostles in their sound and spiritual teachings.&quot; In the same breath
Gaebelein speaks of four saints named John who will be present at that great celestial
meeting when Christ returns--John Calvin, John Knox, John Wesley, and John Darby.24</p>


<p>William Kelly, Darby's closest friend and greatest student, never tired of admonishing
others to &quot;Read Darby!&quot; With some fifty-three volumes to his credit--including
everything from a complete translation of the Bible to a volume of verse--there is much of
Darby to read.</p>


<p>John Nelson Darby continued to serve and proclaim his Savior both with the written and
spoken word until his departure to be with Him on the 29th of April, 1882. And no matter
what subject he addressed, one theme always came to the fore--Jesus Christ. Just a few
days before his home-going Darby wrote in a final letter to the Brethren, &quot;I can say,
Christ has been my only object; thank God, my righteousness too . . . Hold fast to
Christ.&quot;25 W</p>
