      <P><FONT COLOR="#643200" SIZE="+1">John was born and reared in
      Lubbock, as were both his parents. John grew up playing in Southwest
      Lubbock garage bands. He became proficient in several musical
      instruments: drums, bass, keyboards, harmonica (I've never seen
      John pick up an instrument he couldn't either already play or
      figure out in forty or so minutes). John also became interested
      in equipment. Blessed with encouraging parents who happened to
      have the means to &quot;spoil&quot; their kid, John began amassing
      a set of sound equipment of which all the local players eventually
      became aware. John became the &quot;go-to guy&quot; for working
      sound at the limited number of music venues in town. He built
      his own sound-room in the backyard.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
      The man is a mountain of talent.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#643200" SIZE="+1">Whether he was howling with
      a four piece band on stage or quietly hidden in the dark with
      the mixing board, John was smack dab in the middle of the garage
      band scene in Lubbock for almost fifteen years.</FONT><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200"><BR>
      <HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT></I><B>Chris</B>: The reason I want to
      talk to you, John Nelson, is because there&#146;s a period of
      that &#145;80s-&#145;90's Rock-n-Roll scene in Lubbock when there
      was a whole lot of people there in Lubbock rockin' &amp; rollin',
      and -- because you had the equipment and the talent and the know-how
      -- you really were behind the scenes a lot of that generation
      of musicians, for a long period of time.&nbsp;So you have a lot
      of knowledge.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: You know that&#146;s true: &quot;Behind the scenes.&quot;
      [Laughing] If I had to wrap it all up in three words, it would
      be: &quot;Behind the Scenes.&quot;</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: That&#146;s where you see everything that&#146;s
      goin&#146; on.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: No. I understand. Well, that whole &#145;80s
      scene - Everybody my age that was influenced by &quot;Pop Culture&quot;,
      &quot;Top 40 music&quot; etc. Those of us who were in &quot;Generation
      X&quot; came up through Disco, and Roller-Boogie, and then almost
      overnight we were asked to accept Kiss and Motley Crue and Guns-N-Roses.
      It was Metal&#146;s turn to take over the popular culture scene.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Very good&#133;Let&#146;s talk about Metal music
      and Lubbock. I remember one year <I>Kiss</I> kicked off their
      world tour in Lubbock on Halloween night. Do you remember that?
      Or did I make that up?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: I was at the show.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>Chris</B>: Okay. Well, when you're talking about &quot;popular
      music&quot; in Lubbock: It&#146;s either George Strait Country
      or it&#146;s Heavy Metal. Maybe you can talk about the popularity
      of Heavy metal in Lubbock; comment on that strange duality?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: The Metal scene and Rock-n-Roll has always been
      a product of the &quot;Immoral Majority&quot; in Lubbock. There
      are always those that will fall into line and try to play inside
      the side-lines. And then there&#146;s those whose responsibility
      it is to go over-the-top, out-of-bounds, as far and as wild as
      you can, and Heavy Metal is certainly, &quot;As far and as wild
      as you can go&quot; in Lubbock. Me and a lot of my friends -
      and a lot of blessed souls that are still there - were trying
      to push the boundaries.</P>

      <P>Ever since Greg Woolum and I were kids at school and were
      so totally into <I>Kiss</I> where he and I began to drool on
      our desks as though we were spitting up blood, emulating Gene
      Simmons the &quot;Bat/Lizard,&quot; sticking out our tongues.
      One particular story is we were in art class one day at Mae Murphey
      Elementary&#133;And you remember the way Gene Simmons would spit
      the blood in his little &quot;blood-spitting&quot; segment of
      the show? It would slowly start to drool out and then he would
      shake his head and the blood would go flyin&#146; everywhere.
      So rather than blood, we would just drool all upon ourselves.
      [Laughs.] We were in about Fourth Grade, y&#146;know.&nbsp;<BR>
      At one point the teacher caught us starin&#146; across the room,
      drooling and looking at each other and sticking our tongues out
      like Gene Simmons. She pointed her finger and said, &quot;BABIES
      DROOL!&quot; [Laughs.] And that still sticks in both of our brains!</P>

      <P>And, y'know, I think that maybe that&#146;s true: Babies do
      drool. But the trick is to be a 40 year-old baby. Now that's
      entertainment!</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: <I>Kiss</I> was such a big deal in Lubbock at
      the period of time when we were growing up&#133;There was all
      that &quot;Knights In Satan&#146;s Service&quot; business...[Laughs]</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. Or &quot;Kings In Satan&#146;s Service.&quot;</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: And <I>Kiss</I> is so incredibly benign, really.
      Other than being loud and flashy, there's nothing much diabolical
      or threatening about <I>Kiss</I>. I guess it&#146;s sort of sexual.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. That&#146;s one great, wonderful thing about
      Lubbock: Is that if you were a part of the &quot;Immoral Majority,&quot;
      you were always given credit for being way more clever and evil
      than you actually were, you know. You&#146;re organizational
      skills were always top-notch, and you were certainly organized
      to take over.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Who is this &quot;Immoral Majority&quot; you&#146;re
      talking about? Who are these people: &quot;The Immoral Majority&quot;?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: The &quot;little dark circles.&quot;</P>

      <P>I suppose we should get into the &quot;Abbey Road scene.&quot;
      Because to me&#133;When I was 14 and 15 years old, that was our
      entr&eacute;e to the Metal scene. There were bands there that
      were the Rock-n-Roll guys, five and six years older than us,
      18 and 20 year olds, that we really looked up to. <BR>
      One of the big bands that we looked up to were called <B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">Battle-Axe</FONT></I></B>, who later became
      <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Battalion</FONT></I></B>. They were
      great! It was <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Mike Farrell</FONT></B>
      and <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Kent Tisdell</FONT></B> and, for
      a short time, <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">John Griffith</FONT></B>--who
      plays the keys--joined the band. And <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">David
      Downham</FONT></B> was the lead-guy and played the bass. His
      father was the principal at Evans Jr. High; [<FONT SIZE="-2"
       FACE="Verdana">Note: on the Southwest, &quot;up-scale&quot;
      side of Lubbock</FONT>]. So he was the ultimate hypocrisy and
      the ultimate point man for the &quot;Immoral Majority.&quot;</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Well who were these guys? What was up with these
      guys?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Downham was a choir singer; ultimately got a
      degree in music. John Griffith ultimately got a degree in music.
      Kent Tisdell played in bands for years&#133;I was fortunate enough
      to play with Mike Farrell and Kent in a band later, called <B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">The Lloyds</FONT></I></B>. I really looked up
      to all those guys.</P>

      <P>Really, our big treat was to go to <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Abbey
      Road</FONT></I></B>, open for this band and make what Woolam
      and I called our &quot;Taco Villa money.&quot; You make fifty
      bucks. What&#146;s better? You get chicks. You kinda&#146; get
      to hang there at the bar, and you&#146;re under-age, which is
      a big treat. And you know you&#146;re not gonna&#146; get kicked
      out &#145;cause you&#146;re &quot;the talent.&quot;</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Describe <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Abbey Road</FONT></I></B>.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Abbey Road</FONT></I></B>
      was in a strip-mall on Slide Road, right near the Mall. It was
      the last door down at the end of the strip-mall. The owner was
      a guy named <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Carl Campanelli</FONT></B>
      who was a long-time club owner in Lubbock. He&#146;s owned several
      clubs, and he <I>honestly was</I> THE conduit for the Rock scene
      in Lubbock for a long time. He ultimately bought the <B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">Back Stage</FONT></I></B>, over there on Slide
      and 34th, by the railroad tracks. That was later called <B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">New West</FONT></I></B>.</P>

      <P>[John&#146;s cell-phone rings.] Hi, honey baby. [Tape stops.
      Its our friend Denise Robnett, another expatriated Lubbock woman,
      keeping in touch.]</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: [Resuming] So you were telling me about how
      you and Greg would go open for these bands at <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Abbey
      Road</FONT></I></B>.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: We were a band called <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Shrapnel</FONT></I></B>.
      Shrapnel was <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Rick Ramsey</FONT></B>
      on drums...Who&#146;s the best drummer ever in the god-damn world!
      He&#146;s the best drummer ever. And he&#146;s a dentist now.
      [<FONT COLOR="#643200" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">NOTE: Now, remember
      John has worked with some pretty accomplished drummers, so this
      is a compliment that John does not make lightly. - c.o.</FONT>]</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Wow. A dentist. Really?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: There are some guys that are just born to be
      drummers. But Bumpy - we called Rick Ramsey &quot;Bumpy&quot;
      - was the greatest. He was great. <BR>
      So, <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Shrapnel</FONT></I></B>...There
      was a guy named <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Pat Cooper</FONT></B>
      who played the bass; he was good, too. <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Chad
      Bartee</FONT></B> was on the rhythm guitar. <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Greg
      Woolam</FONT></B> was on lead guitar. And then I sang and played
      some keyboards.</P>

      <P>We were all just these sons of professionals, doctors and
      lawyers, y&#146;know? With instruments and equipment. The diplomat
      for the group was Bartee. He hit the <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Abbey
      Road</FONT></I></B> scene and got us a gig opening for a band
      called <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Deep Spirit</FONT></I></B>.
      Chad Bartee's dad is Dr. Bartee the dentist and is still in Lubbock
      now. Chad&#146;s got a successful medical sales company with
      his brother. He was good friends with Woolam. The Southwest Little
      League Baseball got those guys together. God Bless the Southwest
      Little League Baseball.<BR>
      I don&#146;t remember meeting Greg Woolam. His mother sang in
      my parent&#146;s wedding. We&#146;ve been best friends since
      birth. We have a lot of unspoken languages and a lot of coded
      languages by now. He&#146;s just really my best friend and an
      invaluable musical and inspirational resource for me. We&#146;ve
      always done music together. His dad is Gerald Woolam, the current
      President of the American Cancer Society&#133;So Greg's the son
      of a doctor; I&#146;m the son of a lawyer; Bartee&#146;s the
      son of a doctor. Whatever&#133;blah, blah, blah.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Alright. But that&#146;s interesting though.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: That&#146;s how you get music equipment when
      you're a kid: You have rich dads. Being in a band, you gotta&#146;
      stress your resources.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: You say, &quot;You&#146;re gonna&#146; give
      me this extra allowance, so I&#146;m gonna spend it on equipment,
      and I&#146;m gonna&#146; build a sound-room, or I&#146;m gonna&#146;
      put together a band.&quot;<BR>
      I think it&#146;s interesting to see how people&#146;s parents
      take that. I mean, when you were buying musical equipment - and
      your parents were obviously paying for that - How was that taken?
      Tell me a little bit about your parents; their relationship with
      Lubbock and their relationship with you. That&#146;s real interesting
      to me.</P>
