      <IMG SRC="NelsonConwayCO.JPG" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="209"
      ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT><B>John</B>:
      My parents are both Lubbock products. <A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/intJohnNelson3.html"
      TARGET="_blank">My dad has been a life-long Lubbock citizen</A>.
      My mother moved there in junior high. They met at Carroll Thompson
      [Junior High School] and then went to Lubbock High School together;
      went to Texas Tech; got married, went to Dallas. Dad went to
      SMU law school, and they came back to Lubbock after he graduated.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: <A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/intJohnNelson3.html" TARGET="_blank">Your
      dad can sing</A>. Your dad can really sing.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Dad is an artist. He&#146;s an artist, pure and
      simple. Practicing law has been a good thing; that's how he makes
      his living. But the fact of the matter is that he has an artistic
      heart. His creative element rears itself in so many different
      ways. He's done a few sculptures through the years, and they're
      wonderful and beautiful, and even somewhat renowned.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: And your mother is one of the leading - I guess
      one would call it - &quot;charity activists&quot; in Lubbock&#133;I
      don&#146;t know what you would call somebody like that. But somebody
      who just really goes out there and makes a difference in the
      community.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: My mother has so many wonderful qualities, we&#146;d
      burn up too many tapes talking about it. But the story is: Through
      the Junior League and all of the charity work that they do, Mom
      got started with working with battered women, and then she founded
      <A HREF="http://interoz.com/hearts/wps.HTM" TARGET="_blank">Women&#146;s
      Protective Services</A> in Lubbock. She&#146;s now the <B>Director
      of Planned Parenthood</B> in Lubbock.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: How is that going over in Lubbock?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Um - It&#146;s going over like a lead zeppelin.
      Because, uh&#133;[Laughs] You know, it&#146;s very hard to preach
      the gospel of contraception and women&#146;s health issues there
      in Lubbock -- in one of the really most conservative &quot;Christian-Republican&quot;
      type communities around. They always put abortion on the forefront
      of the argument. <BR>
      But the service they provide does so much more for so many women.<BR>
      Mom's done so much for many, <I>many</I> women in and around
      Lubbock.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: So, I remember when you were in high school;
      You had all that musical equipment in your room&#133; So your
      parents are <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">George Nelson</FONT></B>
      and <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Joe Love Nelson</FONT></B>, pillars
      of Lubbock society. Was it your grandfather who was a State Senator?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Hobert Nelson,
      State Senator, 1937</FONT></B>.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: You were this nice &quot;Southwest Lubbock&quot;
      family. So your parents decide to buy you all this equipment.
      And you were a big part of the whole Southwest Lubbock Rock-n-Roll
      garage band scene - and there's a lot of amazingly talented people
      who've come out of that group. So your parents were supportive
      of that business? Do you think your parents reacted to your interest
      in Rock music differently in relation to how the general population
      did?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Only now am I able to appreciate what a gift
      it is to have parents who will buy you a drum set to put in your
      bedroom when you&#146;re 8 years old; To have parents who recognized
      that you really truly have a passion about something; probably
      early on, when you were looping your patent leather white belt
      through your lunch pail and banging it with a big wooden spoon.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: That&#146;s cool.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Both of them have always been singers and artistic
      thinkers and appreciators of art and music.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: So you think they were glad to see one of their
      babies interested in music?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. Dad could have been many things: He could
      have been a professional baseball player; and he could have been
      a professional musician. He&#146;s one of those people that would
      have been great at anything that he did.<BR>
      I think it&#146;s probably a thrill for him, the fact that I&#146;ve
      pursued a creative way to make a living. As much as I would like
      to be practicing law with him and maybe vice-versa, I think he
      does get a big thrill of out the fact that I&#146;m out here
      doin&#146; what I&#146;m doin&#146; and trying to make a go of
      it in the music business. They&#146;re totally proud. They seem
      proud. They&#146;ve both become really close friends to me, and
      I value that relationship as much as I do any other relationship
      I have in my life.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Let&#146;s talk about some other specifics.
      I want to talk later about <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B>.
      But <B><A HREF="intJohnNelson2.html#RudeBoys" TARGET="_blank">Hal Nelson</A></B>
      - no relation to you, of course - the bass player for <I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">,</FONT>
      told me that they loved writing their own songs and doing their
      original music but that they felt like they had to do &quot;cover
      stuff&quot; mostly, because that&#146;s what people are paying
      to see.</P>

      <P>Maybe you could talk about the people who are trying to be
      creative musicians and still live in Lubbock? That&#146;s really,
      I think, the angle I was trying to get from you; people who are
      in Lubbock, trying to make music and also trying to make a living..<IMG

      BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">. or make their &quot;Taco Villa
      cash,&quot; whatever.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: You betcha&#146;. The guys that are the pure
      examples of that are: <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Robin Griffin</FONT></B>,

      Allison</A></B>.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea! Donnie Allison.<BR>
      And <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Villa/6386/lubbockrockandroll.html"><B>Darren
      Welch</B> and <B><I>Ground Zero</I></B></A>. Darren Welch is
      a great friend of mine. I&#146;ve known him for a very long time.
      He&#146;s older than me, and I&#146;ve always looked up to him.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: What was his story? Darren Welch&#146;s dad
      was a plumber, right?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. Welch Plumbing. Bobby Welch is Darren's
      dad; He&#146;s big in the plumbing business in Lubbock, and also
      he was a big-time Little League Coach. Darrens' brother Doug
      was a super-straight, baseball, &quot;all-American&quot;, short-haired
      ol' boy. Darren was &quot;the Partier.&quot; <BR>
      Darren would hole up in his room with the guitar, rockin&#146;
      out; sorta&#146; the &quot;withdrawn&quot; element. To be a really
      great Rock guitar player, at some point you have to be &quot;the
      15 year old with nothing better to do than to sit around for
      6 straight hours until your fingers hurt, playing the guitar,
      learning songs, and jammin&#146;. And that&#146;s certainly what
      Darren did.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: In Lubbock, it seems like you&#146;re either
      &quot;a Church-goer&quot; or &quot;a Partier.&quot; You gotta'
      commit at some point, there in Lubbock, one side of the street
      or the other...or should I say, &quot;one side of the Strip or
      the other?&quot; <BR>
      It is that &quot;Black and White&quot; thing. You&#146;re either
      gonna&#146; commit to playing the guitar or goin&#146; to <I><A
      HREF="http://www.younglife.org/" TARGET="_blank">Young-Life</A></I>.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Mhhm. You could go to <I>Young-Life</I> and play
      the guitar but, y&#146;know, it would have to be the acoustic.
      And you&#146;re pretty much stuck with &quot;<I>Jesus Stood By
      the Way and He Cried</I>.&quot; or &quot;<I>Kum By Yah</I>.&quot;
      But you&#146;re not gonna&#146; get away with &quot;<I>Breakin&#146;
      the law! Breakin&#146; the Law!</I>&quot; <B>Bobby Patterson</B>
      once played a <I>Young-Life</I> gig once with his band; They
      had a song called &quot;<I>You Get Me Off</I>&quot; and they
      turned it into &quot;<I>You Knock It Off</I>&quot;, like &quot;Knock
      off the drugs.&quot;</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: The Great <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Stubb&#146;s
      Barbecue</FONT></I></B>. God bless it! I just want to make sure
      that I&#146;m on record as saying how absolutely proud I am of
      Eddy and all his <I>Stubb's</I> brothers there. I&#146;m one
      of the few people that could probably tell this story, but I
      lived in Florida for a year while I was going to recording school
      and Eddy was driving across the country getting that <I>Stubb&#146;s
      Barbecue Sauce</I> into the grocery stores. He drove through
      Orlando and hung-out with me. But he drove around down there
      and worked so hard that soon I could go to my grocery store on
      the corner in Orlando, Florida, and buy <I>Stubb&#146;s Barbecue
      Sauce</I>, which I was very proud of. <BR>
      But a year later when I moved to Los Angeles, I lived over here
      in Brentwood and I have a corner grocery store that I could go
      to and here, also, I could buy <I>Stubb&#146;s Barbecue Sauce</I>!
      And I thought, &quot;Shit! Coast to Coast!&quot; Immediately,
      when I moved here and was able to go to my grocery store and
      buy <I>Stubb&#146;s</I>, I called Eddy and I said, &quot;I can&#146;t
      tell you how proud I am of you. But I&#146;m very proud to announce
      that I&#146;ve lived on both coasts in the last 6 months, and
      I now can go to any corner grocery store around and pick up your
      sauce. Congratulations.&quot;</P>

      <P>You can get <I>Stubb's Barbecue Sauce</I> in Paris, France.
      Now, of course, it&#146;s all over the world</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: They have done a great job. <IMG SRC="RudeBoys.jpg"
      WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="198" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
      We were just talking about <I>The Rude Boys</I>.<A NAME="RudeBoys"></A></P>

      <P><B>John</B>: <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">The Rude Boys</FONT></I>
      took the &quot;Alternative&quot; point in Lubbock in the Mid-80's.
      With Bumpy playin&#146; the drums, they were absolutely the best
      Pop-Alternative-Party Band that I&#146;ve ever seen come out
      of Lubbock. Very dynamic. <BR>
      They were just very good about what cover songs they played.
      I mean, they were only playing cover songs, mostly. But they
      were great about choosing the ones to always keep the crowd riding
      the fuckin&#146; wave.</P>

      <P><A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/RobertPatterson.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Bobby Patterson</B></A>
      is a pure entertainer. Bobby&#146;s one of the guys that I&#146;ve
      always looked up to the most for being able to &quot;do it all&quot;
      artistically. Wonderful guy.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: He had a lot of courage in Lubbock. Bobby had
      NO inhibitions about being an actor and an artist&#133;And proud
      of it.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Then there's <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">John Fillipone</FONT></B>
      and <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Hal Nelson</FONT></B>; I can&#146;t
      say enough. Those two guys are a classic example of &quot;Synergy&quot;
      or &quot;the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the
      parts.&quot; Hal played the bass. John was a guitarist. <BR>
      John had gone away to high school at <I>The Deerfield Academy</I>
      in Massachusetts and then college, and then came back to Lubbock.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Why did he go away for high school?</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Um&#133;y&#146;know, to become the fuckin&#146;
      giant &quot;big-brain&quot; genius that he is now, I guess. I
      don&#146;t know. He&#146;s one of the smartest guys I&#146;ve
      ever known. Actually, you and John are the two smartest fuckers
      I&#146;ve ever known. We're all making D&#146;s and C&#146;s
      in school, and you two guys were making straight A&#146;s, and
      partying twice as hard as we were. Y'all were my idols.&nbsp;</P>

      <P>But anyway...Fillipone came back to Lubbock, and he was always
      playing guitar. He was a great musician, took it very seriously
      and by the book. And of course, in every band Fillipone was ever
      in, it was a rare treat to have Fillipone sing. As you&#146;ll
      recall in the <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B>
      days, there was a big movement to &quot;Let Fillipone Sing.&quot;
      [Laughs.] Okay &#133;Had we had more <I>Velvet Underground</I>,
      or Kris Kristofferson, or uh&#133;Bob Dylan sort of vocal set-ups,
      Fillipone would have been the shoe-in. As it turned out though,
      in <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B>, we
      were particularly doing a lot of <I>Jane&#146;s Addiction</I>-type
      stuff, <I>Violent Femmes</I>, Alternative &#145;80's stuff.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Now, I think we&#146;re kind of blending&#133;We
      got <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Rude Boys</FONT></I></B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200"> </FONT></I>and we got <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B>&#133;</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea, I know. It&#146;s all sort of a blur. Sorry.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Of course, the common element between those
      two bands were John Fillipone and Hal Nelson. That combo, along
      with with <B><A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/intTrentHunt.html" TARGET="_blank">Trent
      Hunt</A></B> and <B><FONT COLOR="#643200">Mark Fallis </FONT></B>on
      drums, made up <I>Squarehead</I>, for most of it&#146;s existence.
      Then, at the end there, you John Nelson took over on drums.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: And that was really when the &quot;creative explosion&quot;
      of <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B> took
      place. [Laughs.]</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: So you had been working the sound for <I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I> for along time and eventually,
      you joined the band.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: Yea. There&#146;s that equipment talking, see?
      Now we&#146;re back to all the equipment. How that all happened
      and how I ended up being a recordist and an engineer and a producer-type
      freak is that I had all of this equipment that we needed to have
      in order &quot;to take our music to the world, Man!&quot; So
      we had all of this great equipment.</P>

      <P>See, I didn't have a band at the time when Hal was in <I>The
      Rude Boys</I>. Hal called me and said, &quot;Hey, Dude. Do you
      still have all that gear? You wanta&#146; run our sound?&quot;
      It at <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">The Spoon</FONT></I></B>.<A

      So I went and ran the <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Rude Boys</FONT></I>
      sound, and I really enjoyed it.<BR>
      I&#146;ve always enjoyed the gear and working with the equipment
      and recording and doin&#146; &quot;live&quot; sound and stuff.
      So that&#146;s how I got started.</P>

      <P>So when <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Squarehead</FONT></I></B>
      first got started, they started off with the name <B><I><FONT
       COLOR="#643200">The Love Drops</FONT></I></B>. Then they changed
      it to <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">The Fence-Post Moderns</FONT></I></B>.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: <B><I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Cruisin&#146; With
      a Boner</FONT></I></B> was one I liked.</P>

      <P><B>John</B>: I believe <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Cruisin&#146;
      With a Boner </FONT></I>was a <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">Rude Boys</FONT></I>-alternative
      theme.</P>

      <P><B>Chris</B>: Oh. Well, I liked that name. Don&#146;t forget

      at Texas Tech; We had a lot of English classes together. Hal
      always wore a leather jacket. I remembered that he had been in
      <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">The Rude Boys</FONT></I>, but I didn&#146;t
      really meet him when he was in <I><FONT COLOR="#643200">The Rude

      to know Hal&#133;That dude&#133;Every time I get around him,
      I just want him to play his guitar. He's really so good.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#643200" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">ANALYSIS</FONT></B><BR>
      It is obvious that we only briefly touched on many talented individuals
      who grew up playing music in Lubbock, some of the best examples
      of that recurring Lubbock music phenomenon: &quot;Nothin' Else
      to Do.&quot; While it would be wonderful to give in-depth descriptions
      of every one of these artists, here we can view this cursory
      list as merely an example of the incredible amount of musical
      talent in Lubbock which never is heard outside of the smoky bars
      of Lubbock itself. To enthusiastically praise the musical skill
      of many of these individuals--who grew up to be middle-class
      family-men--is certainly no idle compliment for someone like
      John Nelson, who has worked with the world-class talent John
      has.</P>

      <P>I recall many times as a youth when I was in&nbsp;some dark
      Lubbock barroom, marveling to the talent and sound emanating
      from these guys on stage, thinking, &quot;I must be in the coolest
      place in the world right now! How can this sort of talent go
      un-tapped, stuck here in the remote plains of West Texas?&quot;
      It was listening to these bands that made it clear to me at a
      young age that there is something very special about the music
      scene in my hometown.</P>

      <P>Not everyone has it in them to set out on the road and pursue
      the rough business of a road-show, recording career as <B><A
      HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/intJoeEly.html" TARGET="_blank">Joe Ely</A></B> did, or
      Natalie Maines. For every Joe Ely or Natalie Maines that made
      it out of Lubbock, there are at least a hundred phenomenal artists
      with equal talent who never make it out of the local bars. Being
      in Lubbock and so far removed from the rest of the country, many
      artists resign themselves to &quot;working for Taco Villa money.&quot;</P>

      <P>The odds of getting discovered by a national recording label
      are extremely slim for someone living and performing in Lubbock;
      for that, one must go to Austin or L.A. or Nashville to be seen.</P>

      <P>But as <B><A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/intTerryAllen.html" TARGET="_blank">Terry
      Allen</A></B> says in his song <B><A HREF="http://www.virtualubbock.com/lyrLBKonEverythng.html#anchor16FlatlandFarmer"
      TARGET="_blank">Flatland Farmer</A></B>: <BR>
      &quot;<I>Get out of the city to where the farmer plays<BR>
      And you're into real music country without them city ways</I>.&quot;</P>

      <P>Now, of course, this phenomenon is not limited to Lubbock,
      Texas, but often, the best, most heart-felt music <I>is</I> out
      in the country and will <I>never</I> be discovered by the masses.<BR>

      <FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;As a whole, the interviews create a portrait
      not only of Lubbock's musicians and artists, but also of the
      musical community that has sustained them, including venues such
      as the legendary Cotton Club and the original Stubb's Barbecue.
      This kaleidoscopic portrait of the West Texas music scene gets
      to the heart of what it takes to create art in an isolated, often
      inhospitable environment. As Oglesby says, &quot;Necessity is
      the mother of creation. Lubbock needed beauty, poetry, humor,
      and it needed to get up and shake its communal ass a bit or go
      mad from loneliness and boredom; so Lubbock created the amazing
      likes of Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock, Terry Allen, and
      Joe Ely.&quot;</FONT>
