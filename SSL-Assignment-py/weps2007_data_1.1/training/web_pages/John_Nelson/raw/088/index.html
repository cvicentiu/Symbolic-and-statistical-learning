"To those whom much is given, much is expected." 

<P>
The simple proverb holds great meaning for John Nelson (MSME '76), and
unlocks one reason for his generosity. For his engineering education,
dedicated professors, and the skills he has employed throughout his
successful career, Nelson says, "I feel extremely grateful."

<P>
With students in mind, Nelson established the John S. Nelson
Scholarship Fund. His donation also will help furnish the lounge in
the Student Leadership Center and the video and teleconference room in
the Technical Communication Center. ECB, currently under construction,
will be a vibrant, state-of-the-art student meeting place, research
facility, classroom, exposition space and more. 

<P>
"I targeted the centers building because I am an avid supporter of
(Dean Emeritus) John Bollinger's vision that the building is necessary
to move the college forward," he says. "The scholarship is part of a
broader plan I have to provide resources in more of an ongoing
manner. The contribution for the centers building is one-time; the
scholarship is perpetual." 

<P>
President and CEO of Affiliated Engineers, Inc. (AEI), Madison,
Wisconsin, Nelson is known for his innovative mechanical design of
laboratory spaces in commercial and educational buildings. He has
managed and directed the designs of major research facilities, utility
plants, offices and data centers, hospitals and public buildings
nationwide. He also serves on the Mechanical Engineering Board of
Visitors, and is an instructor of laboratory mechanical design.
