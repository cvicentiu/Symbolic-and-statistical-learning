soon brought his daughters to the split shake cabin he built in the forests of
Sequoias and Ponderosa Pines. By the mid-1890's Camp Nelson had become a popular
vacation spot, in spite of the fact that vacationers had to ride horseback or
walk by trail most of the way from Springville. In the late 1890's Nelson and
Carmel Wilson built a pack station about four miles above Springville. There was
room at the station for customers to park their buggies or wagons, and later
automobiles, while they packed into the mountains, often stopping at Camp
      Nelson.&nbsp;</font></td>

      Gradually John Nelson expanded his facilities. A small store was built to
      supply visitors, and soon other families began building their own cabins
      nearby. Some of those cabins are still in active use by the descendents of
      the original inhabitants.&nbsp; Soon Nelson installed a sawmill on the
      creek just below the lodge, and construction of conventional cabins began.

      The rapid development of Camp Nelson began when a road was extended from
      the Forks in 1922. The original road was narrow, crooked, and dusty.
      Traffic had to be controlled to ensure that cars coming in opposite
      directions would not meet. There was no way for them to pass! Later the
      road was widened and resurfaced. Many more families built cabins in the
      Sequoias near Nelson's lodge in the years that followed.</font></td>

<p>&nbsp; <font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">In 1927 a major
disaster occurred: Nelson's lodge burned to the ground! Nelson Smith, grandson
of John Neslon, immediately began
construction of a new lodge. It was to be quite an impressive structure with
stone facing on the outside and, a large lobby with two tremendous fireplaces
and other facilities to match. Costs were higher than expected and the Smiths
ran into financial trouble. The structure remained uncompleted until years
later. In 1951 the Southern California Edison Company extended electrical
service to Camp Nelson and about the same time the road was extended all the way
to the campgrounds at Quaking Aspen Meadow. The Smiths retired soon after. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beautiful lodge has been renovated and is now open
again, even as improvements continue. Located
in one of the most naturally beautiful places on Earth, the lodge has all the
modern amenities you would expect. Bed-and-breakfast service will be
available soon. </font></p>
