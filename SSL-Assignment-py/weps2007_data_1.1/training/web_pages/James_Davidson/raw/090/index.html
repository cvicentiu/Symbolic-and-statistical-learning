<br />
By entering into the land of penny stocks to support their 'Homeland Security' penny stock operation they increase the chance that U.S.penny stocks might be used for money laundering and by operating like a typical offshore penny stock scheme they encourage others by their examples to do the same.If Woolsey or Asa Hutchinson or Tom McMillen can think of no better way to help their homeland perhaps they should all retire. <br />
<br />
<br />
What do ex-CIA Chief James Woolsey,Tom McMillen, Asa Hutchinson, ,Don Nickles all have in common ? Probably a greedy envy of the Beltway penny stock fraudster James Dale Davidson, founder of Agora Inc. of Baltimore's,etc., premiere world penny stock promotion and manipulation 'internet-work' that has pioneered the use of the world wide web to tout penny stock scams and probably launder money with unaudited U.S. penny stock shares.James Dale Davidson and his Agora Inc.even employed the ex-CIA Chief William Colby before his mysterious drowning for use of his name on Davidson's and Agora Inc.'s, 'Strategic Investment ' letterhead. <br />
<br />
Congressman and Rhodes scholar Tom McMillen almost sold his worthless Global Defense Corporation (``GDC''), located in Washington, DC to a worthless shell penny stock scam with connections not only to Davidson but to Dubai by way of his fellow Rhodes scholar James Dale Davidson of 'Clinton killed Vince Foster' fame.Now he as issued forth 'FORTRESS AMERICA UT' (OTC BB:FAACU.OB) on the penny stock 'investment' world and yet more worthless penny stock shares circulating around the world used to launder money and used like their money by insiders often on themselves rather than reinvesting in a real company,etc.. <br />
<br />
Oh,the irony,did these two Rhodes scholars note as their two worthless shell companies went bump in the night ? Too bad Bill Clinton doesn't rat on his two scammy fellow Rhodes scholars as they were so eager to do over Clinton's sex life and phoney accusations re Clinton's involvement in the death of Vince Foster. <br />
<br />
James Dale Davidson's Amenni penny stock has a Nannaco connection as well as a Dubai connection. Amenni that appears to have a British address or did as well as a Dubai office for whatever reason,was courted by Nannaco and its suspect ' management' that ex Maryland Congressman McMillen apparently did no investigation of before becoming involved.. And yet Tom McMillen thought nothing of selling his own 'GDC' or Global Defense Corporation 'Homeland Security' company in Washington D.C. to Nannaco or allowing Nannaco to use his and his company's name in a pump and dump scam,even though it might be a criminal or money laundering operation with more ties offshore,and in terrorist money laundering supect country Dubai !!, than in America !! <br />
<br />
Is James Dale Davidson using New Zealand ? <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2005/10/97445.php">http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2005/10/97445.php</a> <br />
<br />
<br />
D.C.Terrorbaggers:J. D. Davidson,ex-CIA Woolsey,Asa Hutchinson, Tom McMillen,Don Nickles <br />
<br />
After the U.S. Civil War certain Northern gentlemen found a south in disarray and chaos from losing a civil war and the need to convert a non slave holding south into a wage slave state a fertile ground for <br />
their financial divide and conquer interests.This group became known as 'carpetbaggers' probably both symbolic of their fly by night nature as well as a more than symbolic stuffing of it with loot before departing from the south and back to from where they came.So they had more concern with filling their carpetbag and heading onto another scam than allegiance to the black or white local inhabitants WHO WOULD BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG AFTER THEY WERE GONE . <br />
<br />
<br />
These new carpetbaggers have previous connections with the Washington D.C. Beltway bureaucracy, collectively they have many many years of experience and various contacts in high places between them.They,in this modern era hardly need even a carpetbag when millions of dollars in wealth can flow from the fear machine in Washington D.C. to an offshore bank or trust account in a blink and turn worthless unaudited shares into laundered cash.Yes these are our 'protectors',no more than offshore and onshore carpetbaggers whose very means of financial transactions such as James Woolsey's or James Dale Davidson et.al.'s many offshore accounts. <br />
<br />
It is perhaps for the very reason of these looters and traitors Beltway connections they not only can form a worthless penny shell of a 'company' but attract investors or 'marks' based upon that reputation of <br />
insider political connections that will make your penny stock perhaps part of the federal government's or the CIA's up and coming growth stocks in the never ending war on terror.And thus yet more Beltway spooks are brought out of retirement to keep us scared and disorganised as they loot America and or Iraq etc. on an international scale.Not since Iran Contra and IraqGate have these spooks had it so good,and now unlike the 1980's penny stock scams, they have internet and perhaps the NSA,and SRA International,and Mantas Inc. the supposed anti-money laundering spinoff of SRA International and thus the CIA..... Should the CIA be invested in the stock market at all and is it not yet another conflict of interest to invest in companies such as SRA International whose spioff Mantas Inc gathers insider trader broker etc. info that may be used to help the CIA's In-Q-Tel trade or dump their penny stock etc. investments to the disadvantage of 'ordinary' investors ¿? <br />
<br />
Now with computers and internet and combining NSA et.al. internet spying with internet stock fraud perhaps ? Aside from gambling the stock market is perhaps one of the best money laundering arms of international crime and of looted cash from war or drugs.This is because of what I term 'share-money laundering' that takes advantage of a glaring SEC weakness in penny stock money flows,i-e.- the SEC's inability or unwillingness to audit the issuing of shares, <br />
often allowing penny stock criminals to remain anonymous much less convicted, by often fraudulent,illegal pump and dump and even money laundering penny stock management and the underworld figures who often associate with them. <br />
<br />
Perhaps even for all the boys of D.C.'s patriotism and valor we might request of them:ex-DIA Woolsey,Asa Hutchinson,Tom McMillen,....don't follow the path of National Taxpayers Union founder James Dale Davidson and illegally pump and dump your shares on the market.Do not let those shares be used offshore or they may be used for money laundering. <br />
<br />
<br />
This appears to be the attitude of many of our supposed patriots who are seeing the death and destruction in Iraq and Afghanistan as well <br />
as our military occupation as an opportunity to loot and sack both U.S.coffers in the name of 'security' and a 'war against terror' as well as privitizing out themselves creating every imaginable ' homeland security' company or shell and either pandering to our Beltway bureaucracy or even opening unproven fly by night companies claiming to be offering anything related and with hopes of capturing some of what trickles down in the largesse of the Bush-Cheney world war on terror or to perhaps defraud Americans further through Beltway and government bureaucrats and military and NSA or CIA or ex Beltway politicos such as Asa Hutchinson or Thomas McMillen or ex CIA Chief Woolsey,as if he is not making enough on his Dyncorp interest through lucrative private or corporate military contracts funded by the same U.S.government he was once a humble employee of..... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What do they all have in common ? Envy for James Dale Davidson,founder Agora Inc,premiere world penny stock promotion 'internet-work' that has pioneered the use of the world wide web to <br />
tout penny stock scams,even employing the ex-CIA Chief William Colby before his mysterious drowning for use of his name on Davidson's Agora Inc.,' Strategic Investment ' letterhead. <br />
<br />
All James Dale Davidson's scammy Agora Inc websites make claims of 100's of percentage point gains with their advise.And yet Agora Inc has been allowed to carry on in Baltimore,their international penny stock activities unhampered and with no scrutiny. <br />
<br />
Mr. Davidson is also founder of the National Taxpayers Union and the far right newsmax.com and possibly used ex-CIA Chief Willliam Colby's name without his permission on 'Strategic Investment' whose purpose of stock promotions was converted overnight into a James Dale Davidson,'Clinton killed Vince Foster', political psyops mailing. <br />
<br />
This endeared James Dale Davidson even further to the Beltway far right but as more and more deception and lies were found in James Davidson's and his British smear writer Christopher Ruddy's story of Clinton being behind the death of Vince Foster,it would appear Mr.Davidson may have lost some clout, at least temporarily, in the Beltway.James Dale Davidson is behind so many penny stock and or <br />
other scams at any one time it appears the SEC and U.S. government must purposely turn a blind eye. James Dale Davidson uses the same tactics against investors he defrauds that he uses against his political enemies or perceived enemies such as Bill Clinton.He promises 100's of percentage point returns and lies about the real reason for collapse of share value, generally his own massive dumping of shares he got for pennies on the penny. <br />
<br />
Ex-CIA Chief Woolsey on the other hand has apparently some of Mr.Davidson's offshore skills so he wasn't an ex-CIA for nothing. He even has an <br />
offshore account probably more than one to dump those penny shares of Asa Hutchinson,Don Nickle's and Tom McMillan now priced about $6 a share on the scammy OTC stock board that they all got for about 1 1/2 cents !! But what are they selling but the names and reputations for running scams and pulling strings in Washington D.C.,including support from the Homeland Security or the White House ? And that is exactly what investors buy their worthless shares for as well.So even if the company were to become profitable it would be because of the unethical insider connections of the Beltway carpetbaggers who used their Beltway connections to suck at the tit of the U.S. taxpayers.Defrauded again. <br />
<br />
And it appears Tom McMillen is already aware from his past penny stock activities,trying to take advantage of his basketball notariety, ended in shame and fraud against investors even if no loss was paid by himself.Only 'investors' were the victims of his last penny stock scam.: <br />
<br />
''The 6-foot-11 McMillen was a star basketball player at the University of Maryland and a Rhodes scholar. He played 11 years in the NBA until 1986, then won the first of three terms as a Democratic U.S. representative from Maryland's 4th district. <br />
<br />
McMillen's most prominent business venture since he left the House in1993 was as co-founder and chief executive of Complete WellnessCenters Inc ., a health care company that put together and managed alternative medicine centers. After a $6 million IPO in 1997, the company was briefly (and inconclusively) tangled in a federal health care fraud investigation in 1997 and 1998......'' <br />
<br />
By entering into the land of penny stocks to support their 'Homeland Security' penny stock operation they increase the chance that U.S.penny stocks might be used for money laundering and by operating like a typical offshore penny stock scheme they encourage others by their examples to do the same.If Woolsey or Asa Hutchinson or Tom McMillen can think of no better way to help their homeland perhaps they should all retire. <br />

It seems like only yesterday but must have been earlier this year that Maryland's ex Democratic Congressman and Rhodes scholar Tom <br />
McMillen almost sold his worthless Global Defense Corporation (``GDC''), located in Washington, DC to a worthless shell penny stock with connections to Dubai by way of his fellow Rhodes scholar James <br />
Dale Davidson of 'Clinton killed Vince Foster' fame.Oh,the irony,did these two Rhodes scholars note as their two worthless shell companies <br />
went bump in the night ? Does Tom McMillen know he is now in the murky world of penny stock underworld and mafia of the likes of James Dale Davidson and ex-CIA Chief James Woolsey who has made a 'killing' with his Dyncorp private military and police service to and for the U.S. government and favored U.S. corporations in Iraq and Afghanistan etc. <br />
A google search ' woolsey dyncorp' will give you a general idea. <br />
<br />
Davidson's Amenni that has had a Nannaco connection as well as a Dubai connection.Amenni that appears to have a British address or did <br />
as well as a Dubai office for whatever reason,was courted by Nannaco and its suspect management and Tom McMillen thought nothing of selling his own 'GDC' or Global Defense Corporation 'Homeland Security' company in Washington D.C. even though it might be a criminal or money laundering operation with more ties offshore,in terrorist money laundering supect country Dubai !!, than in America !! <br />
<br />
And in his greed to get in on the 'war on terror' and the 'homeland security' scare and profit while he can he hooks up with that right wing peudo-patriot ex-CIA Chief Woolsey who has so little respect for <br />
America he opts for offshore accounts for his U.S. war profiteering and to hold and sell or dump as the case may be shares of the penny stock shares he gets for pennies on the penny to sale or dump on less fortunate Americans who must pay taxes onshore unlike himself who will dump his U.S.penny stock shares in the U.SD. market and 're-patriate' his ill gotten gains. <br />

Subject: Repeat SRA International,Mantas Inc link: CIA or mafia on wall street again ? <br />
<br />
Add to topic connection between Mantas having a trove of information yet no one caught for illegal pump and dump etc. ? <br />
<br />
Could Mantas Inc. be trusted to monitor another Beltway connected securities fraud or perhaps cover it up ? For instance the James Dale Davidson and Endovasc dump from Schwab account, Mantas should have been monitoring.What if hypothetically numerous ...... shares were being dumped from Woolsey's offshore accounts or from Asa Hutchinson's or Tom McMillen's or Don Nicke's onshore accounts.Would Mantas catch it ? Or would they miss the dump as they did in Davidson's Charles Schwab account case ? <br />

McMillen Brings Big Names To New Venture <br />
<br />
The 6-foot-11 McMillen was a star basketball player at the University of Maryland and a Rhodes scholar. He played 11 years in the NBA until 1986, then won the first of three terms as a Democratic U.S. representative from Maryland's 4th district. <br />
<br />
McMillen's most prominent business venture since he left the House in1993 was as co-founder and chief executive of Complete WellnessCenters Inc ., a health care company that put together and managed alternative medicine centers. After a $6 million IPO in 1997, the company was briefly (and inconclusively) tangled in a federal health care fraud investigation in 1997 and 1998. McMillen's affiliation with the company ended badly: He sued Wellness after it terminated his employment agreement, according to SEC filings. Wellness, beset by creditor lawsuits, filed for bankruptcy liquidation in New Jersey in March 2001, with assets of $304,000 and debts of $4.4 million. <br />
<br />
For much of the past six years, McMillen has been a merchant banker and has been affiliated with a number of small homeland security firms, either as an investor, director or adviser. He has also been <br />
chief executive of Washington Capital Advisors LLC , a Washington private equity firm. <br />

As for Asa Hutchinson when did he ever contribute to making American or Arkansans lives better for that matter ? As Arkansas Attorney General did he bring those bringing cocaine into Arkansas or trading <br />
it for arms safer ? No. And what was his reward ? W.Bush appointed him drug czar. <br />
And in his short lived and winded role as DEA 'drug czar' did he capture one large heroine dealer of international significance or only do a photo op of some raid on a California Medical marijuana <br />
dispensory ? He actually presided over one of the fastest growing opium and heroine productions in world history since the U.S.invasion of Afghanistan which coincided with his appointment to head the DEA. <br />
<br />
<br />
In many ways he is an example of why 911 happened in the first place.Did he know how many ex Whitewater and Mena related suspects would be coincidentally at and around Venice,Florida's Saudi terrorist flight school ?And why did Jeb Bush not notice and investigate the Arkansas and Saudi presence in Venice,Florida at his friend Wally Hilliard's flight school ? And why didn't Wally Hilliard who must have known his close pal Governor Jeb Bush's father, George Bush,had close contacts with Saudis in the highest circles not get the unusual Saudis training at his Venice flight school checked out by Jeb Bush ? <br />
If only Asa Hutchinson could answer those questions we might be able to solve 911. <br />

Nannaco to Enter $130 Billion Homeland Security Market <br />
Wednesday March 2, 2005 10:47 am ET <br />
<br />
<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/050302/73680.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/050302/73680.html</a> <br />
<br />
<br />
GIG HARBOR, Wash., March 2, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Nannaco, Inc. (OTC <br />
BB:NNNC.OB - News) announced today that the Company has executed a Letter of Intent to acquire Global Defense Corporation (``GDC''), <br />
located in Washington, DC. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The LOI provides for the payment to the Company of cash in stages. Initially GDC will pay $25,000 to the company. At the time a definitive merger agreement is signed, GDC will pay to the company another $125,000. Upon closing the merger GDC will provide an 8% $250,000 Promissory Note payable within 90 days of the closing of the merger. The obligation of GDC to close is conditioned on, among other things, the satisfactory completion of due diligence review by GDC and the reduction of the Company's liabilities to $50,000 or less. <br />
<br />
The Honorable Mr. C Thomas McMillen, Chairman of GDC, was formerly a U.S. Congressman, representing a district in the State of Maryland in the House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993. Mr. McMillen has over 18 years of combined experience in government,finance and mergers and acquisitions. In February 2003, Mr. McMillen founded GlobalSecure <br />
Corp., a homeland security consolidator focusing on companies serving critical incident responders and where, as Chief Executive Officer until February 2004, he was instrumental in securing $30 million equity capital. In 2003, Mr. McMillen served as Vice Chairman and Director of Sky Capital Enterprises, Inc., a venture capital firm, and Chairman of Sky Capital Holdings, its brokerage affiliate. Mr. McMillen was appointed by President Clinton to Co-Chair the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports from 1993 to 1997. <br />
Prior to serving in Congress, Mr. McMillen played for 11 years in the National Basketball Association. Mr. McMillen received a BS in chemistry from the University of Maryland, and a Bachelor and Master <br />
of Arts from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. <br />
<br />
Mr. Paul B. Silverman currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Global Defense Corp. Mr. Silverman has over 30 years of senior management experience, having served as the CEO of both public and private companies. In 2003, Mr. Silverman assisted in restructuring MobilePro Corporation (OTC BB:MOBL.OB - News), a publicly traded third generation wireless chip company, and was appointed founding Chairman of the MobilePro Corporate Advisory Board (2003-2004). <br />
<br />
Mr. Silverman has also held senior management consulting positions with Coopers and Lybrand, Booz Allen and Hamilton, and from 1991 through 1996 served as CEO for James Martin Strategy, Inc., an <br />
international management consulting firm with global headquarters in Amsterdam. He has extensive corporate management experience, including senior positions at GTE, Xerox, SBS, IBM and RCA. Mr. <br />
Silverman holds a BS in Physics from CCNY and an MS in Management from Polytechnic University of New York. <br />
<br />
The outline of the proposed merger transaction set forth in this press release presents only certain material provisions of the non-binding letter of intent between the parties and is, of course, subject to the terms of the definitive merger agreement which will be executed by the Company and GDC. <br />
<br />
GDC is in the business of providing added value to existing companies with products and services relating to the Homeland Security industry. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to: <br />
remote sensing technologies, security assessment and simulation software, surveillance technologies and others. GDC adds value by providing strong and proven management, a highly accomplished <br />
advisory board, and the ability to support new technology and business developments through new financing. Currently, GDC is in negotiations to acquire several acquisition targets consistent with its business objective of creating a large scale global security technology firm. <br />
<br />
``We are pleased to have concluded this Letter of Intent with Nannaco,'' said Paul Silverman. ``I anticipate prompt completion of this transaction, which provides a strong foundation enabling GDC to <br />
achieve its ambitious business objectives of global consolidation of critical homeland security technologies.'' <br />
<br />
Steve Careaga, CEO of Nannaco, expressed delight at signing the Letter of Intent. ``We could not be more excited about our opportunity to combine with Global Defense Corp.,'' he noted. <br />
``Homeland Security is currently one of the fastest growing sectors in the United States. Combined government and private sector expenditures are expected to exceed $130 billion in the next five <br />
years. I look forward to completing this transaction so that Nannaco shareholders can participate in this exciting and fast growing marketplace.'' <br />
<br />
In a prior press release and in filings with the SEC, the Company disclosed that it intended to merge with NAZZ Productions, Inc., a film production company controlled by Mr. Nick Stagliano. In order to <br />
fulfill its obligations to NAZZ and to the trading markets, the Company intends to reorganize NAZZ into a subsidiary of the Company and to perform the undertakings necessary to make NAZZ a stand-alone <br />
publicly traded company. The Company's plan includes exploring the possibility of doing a registered spin-out of NAZZ to existing Nannaco shareholders. <br />
<br />
More information about Nannaco, Inc. can be found at <br />
<a href="http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</a> and on Global Defense Corp. on its website at <br />
