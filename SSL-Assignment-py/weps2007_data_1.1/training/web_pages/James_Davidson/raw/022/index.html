						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -27.0pt"> <br>
						.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">RADM 
						Jim Davidson served as Executive Director Supply 
						Operations (DLA O) from July 1989 to August 1991, the 
						most tumultuous time in the history of DLA to that 
						time.&nbsp; DLA emerged as a valued partner with the services 
						in the deployment and sustainment of forces during 
						Desert Shield and Desert Storm that has grown to the 
						recognition as the premier DOD Combat Support Agency.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">During 
						this two year period, RADM Davidson led major expansions 
						in the DLA mission as directed by Defense Management 
						Review Decisions (DMRDs).&nbsp; DMRD 902 directed the 
						Consolidation of the 30 service and DLA Supply depots 
						into the Defense Distribution System.&nbsp;&nbsp; DMRD 926 
						initially directed the consolidation of the service 
						Inventory control Points and was later modified to 
						transfer the remaining approximately one million service 
						managed consumable items to DLA. &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">In 
						September 1989, two months after arrival, &nbsp;RADM Davidson 
						led the DLA O staff in first the conceptual plan and 
						later an implementation plan,&nbsp; for consolidation of the 
						30 supply depots and assumption of wholesale inventory 
						management responsibility for all consumable items.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						While directed by DOD, the services resisted the 
						perceived encroachment on service prerogatives requiring 
						extensive coordination and staffing.&nbsp; .&nbsp; RADM Davidson 
						led the staff work and negotiations for DLA with each of 
						the services.&nbsp; This included detailed plans and business 
						cases resulting in projected recurring savings of $200 
						million per year resulting from the consolidation of the 
						supply depots.&nbsp; &nbsp;He visited every supply depot to ensure 
						uninterrupted support both locally and nationally with a 
						motto of equal or better service at less cost.&nbsp; The 
						original depot consolidation plan included a phased 
						implementation over a three year period.&nbsp; However, with 
						distribution backlogs building within the services 
						during Desert Shield, SECDEF directed the immediate 
						transfer of command and control as of 1 February 1991 
						during the peak of Desert Storm.&nbsp; The &nbsp;result was 
						substantial improvements in service levels in terms of 
						receipt, order and ship times and substantially less 
						cost to the taxpayer.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">In 
						August 1990, in the middle of the DMRD effort , the 
						nation responded to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait with 
						Operation Desert Shield, followed by Operation Desert 
						Storm in January 1991.&nbsp; DLA responded to the sudden 
						surge in demand with unprecedented performance. RADM 
						Davidson was assigned the primary DLA lead for 
						coordinating the 24/7 response to emergent requirements 
						for&nbsp; Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.&nbsp; Within 10 days 
						RADM Davidson assigned a full time DLA representative to 
						the CENTCOM logistics staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; participated in 
						daily planning meetings with the JCS J4 and service 
						logistics staff coordinated the emergency funding and 
						procurements for a variety of commodities such as 
						Chemical and Biological protective suits,&nbsp; Meals Ready 
						to Eat, Desert Cammies, Desert hats and boots as well as 
						special medical support channels for deployed medical 
						units and both hospital ships USS Mercy and USS 
						Comfort.&nbsp; He worked with US Transcom to establish a 
						special daily Desert Express high priority air lift 
						channel to theater.&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">Upon 
						his departure in August 1991, Lt Gen McCausland, 
						Director of DLA, recognized RADM Davidson with the 
						following letter: &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">&quot;During 
						your tenure, Supply Operations was catapulted into the 
						forefront of defense logistics for its leadership in 
						supporting the Persion Gulf war and implementing Defense 
						Management Review Decisions.&nbsp; <i>This period of dynamic 
						change will long be remembered for the creation of DLA 
						as the mega giant in defense supply operations.</i>&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">Your 
						personal leadership, dedication, and commitment to the 
						armed services were the essential keys to DLA's 
						unprecedented success in supplying and sustaining more 
						than half a million Soldiers, Sailors, Airman and 
						Marines during the war<i>….to your credit you were the 
						DLA's heartbeat</i> .&quot;&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">For his 
						outstanding performance in leading the DLA response to 
						Desert Storm and the successful implementation DMRD 902 
						and DMRD 926 Radm Davidson was recognized with the 
						nations highest not combat award, the Defense 
						Distinguished Service Medal. &nbsp; </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt">Since 
						his retirement in 1996 RADM Davidson has remained 
						involved in DOD logistics in industry and &nbsp;as the 
						volunter Chairman of the Logistics Division of the 
						National Defense Industrial Association.&nbsp;</p>
						<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
						For these accomplishments and his continued commitment 
						to DLA and Defense Logistics RADM Jim Davidson is highly 
						qualified and most deserving for recognition in the DLA 
						Hall of Fame. </span>
