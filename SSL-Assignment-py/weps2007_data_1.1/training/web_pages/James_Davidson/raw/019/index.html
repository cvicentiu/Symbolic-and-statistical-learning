Monterrey Wellness Center</CENTER></H2>

<P>The <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20010907061310/monterreywellnesscenter.com/index.html">Monterrey
Wellness Center</A> -- previously called the Davidson Cancer Clinic--
was an outpatient facility in Monterrey, Mexico, that claimed
to have a very high cure rate for cancers. According to its Web
site:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The therapy has proven effective in a wide variety of cancers,
  including breast cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, bone cancer,
  skin cancer, prostate cancer, cancers of the stomach, liver cancer,
  colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, all of P-53 gene category
  cancer. The patient is asked to undergo two treatments a day
  for an amount of time to be determined after doctor's diagnosis.
  The treatments consist of lying on a table similar to getting
  an MRI or X-ray. . . .</P>
  <P>A world renowned scientist has developed a scanning method
  of locating the cancers in a person's body by focusing on a specific
  protein found in cancer. Then, by directing a specific electromagnetic
  frequency [similar to a radio wave] at the cancer cells, the
  cancer cells implode in the body. Once the cancer cells are killed,
  the dead cells and matter are absorbed and excreted through normal
  body processes. These proteins can be detected and measured in
  the patient's urine, although the clinic does not conduct measurements.
  There are no chemicals introduced to the body, and this cancer
  treatment is absolutely non-invasive with no side effects [1].</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <TD WIDTH="50%">To receive the treatment, the patient lies on
      a table inside a &quot;treatment ring&quot; that creates a magnetic
      field for up to a hour, twice a day. The cost is US$17,500 plus
      Mexican taxes of US$2,625. These figures do not include travel
      costs, hotel, food, and other incidental expenses.</TD>

<P>The site also claimed that &quot;people have come to this Clinic
with inoperable cancer and have left with the cancer completely
cured.&quot; Although the Web site did not directly advise whether
to give up standard treatment, it encouraged women diagnosed with
breast cancer to &quot;consider coming before having any surgery,
because CT scans done before and after the Clinic's treatment
have shown clearance of the cancer.&quot; [2]</P>

<P>There is no reason to believe that any of the above claims
of effectiveness were true. There is no scientific evidence exposure
to magnetic fields is effective against cancer, that cancer cells
respond differently than normal cells to a magnetic field, or
that the magnetic field produced by the clinic's device can cause
any cell to implode.</P>

<P>The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices used for medical
diagnosis use radiofrequency waves, a very strong magnetic field,
and a computer to produce cross-sectional images of the body.
The patient is placed inside a large magnetic coil. When the magnetic
field is turned on, it causes hydrogen nuclei (protons) within
the body to line up in one direction. Then selected radiofrequency
waves flip these particles in another direction. When the waves
are turned off, the particles realign, releasing an electromagnetic
signal that the computer translates into an image. The procedure
produces no known permanent effect on cell structure or function.
It may show the presence of a cancer by producing shadows that
represent tumor masses. But it cannot detect any difference between
normal and cancer cells at the <B>cellular </B>level.</P>

<P>If magnetic fields were capable of killing cells, MRI devices
might seriously damage the patient's body. Furthermore, even if
powerful magnetic fields could kill cancer cells, there is no
reason to believe that the clinic's device &shy; which has a much
weaker magnetic field -- would have the same ability.</P>

<P>Because cancers frequently recur, cancer survival statistics
are usually expressed in terms of 5-year follow-up. Thus, even
if a procedure can cure, it would not be possible to know the
outcome without following the patient's status for many years.
Thus the clinic's claim that people are completely cured before
they leave is not something that should be believed. In addition,
there is good reason to conclude that clinic owner, James Gary
Davidson, is not trustworthy.</P>

<H4>Background History</H4>

<P>In 1980, when Davidson lived in Michigan, he made local headlines
with claims that he had invested a way to change water into &quot;hydroziene,&quot;
a fuel that allegedly delivered nine times the mileage of propane
used in trucks. The Grand Rapids Press reported that Davidson
had claimed to have a doctorate in nuclear physics from Ohio State
University, a master's degree in microbiology from Ohio University,
and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Southern
Illinois University. However, officials at Ohio State and Ohio
University told the reporter that they were unable to find any
record that he had attended these schools, and a Southern Illinois
official reported that a James Davidson had attended for two semesters
at age 17. Although Davidson's patent attorney said that Davidson
had said he had worked for the Atomic Energy Commission, a personnel
official at the Department of Energy said that Davidson had never
worked for the Commission. The newspaper report indicated that
investors had sunk $625,000 into a Davidson-run company that supposedly
was studying the fuel, but they had received no test results [3].</P>

<P>In 1994, according to press reports, Davison received an 18-month
suspended sentence after pleading guilty to securities fraud related
to falsely telling an investor that the licensing for a synthetic
fuel called &quot;chasoline&quot; had been sold to the Tennessee
Valley Authority. Davidson reportedly had promised to employ 1,200
people at a plant in Illinois that would make the low-emission
fuel from corn, coal, and water [4-6].</P>

<H4>Fraud Conviction Leads to Prison Sentence</H4>

<P>In June 2000, Davidson, five others, and Macrotech (a corporation
he founded) were charged with criminally defrauding clinic patients
and investors in the corporation [7]. <A HREF="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/davidsonindictment.html">The
63-count indictment stated</A>:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Macrotech was incorporated in Illinois in 1989 and conducts
  business from its principal office in Paris, Tennessee.
  <LI>As Macrotech's president and director, Davidson directed
  its promotion and sale of &quot;investments&quot; in various
  medical and other ventures, based on false claims that its methods
  were effective against cancer and various other serious diseases.
  <LI>The others charged in the scheme were:
  <UL>
    <LI>Davidson's wife Marilyn, was secretary and a director of
    Macrotech.
    <LI>Thomas S. Sawyer, a vice president or director who promoted
    the sale of &quot;investments.&quot;
    <LI>Edward Griswold, Jr., a consultant who promoted the sale
    of &quot;investments.&quot;
    <LI>Graydon Hoover, company accountant who later became a director.
    <LI>William Hardy, assistant manager of the company.
  </UL>
  <LI>The conspirators falsely represented that Macrotech was a
  scientifically advanced company capable of investigating and
  offering effective treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis,
  arthritis, coronary heart disease, AIDS, emphysema, Alzheimer's
  disease, and muscular dystrophy.
  <LI>Through Macrotech, Davison offered treatment for cancer and
  multiple sclerosis which consisted of passing the victim through
  a ring-type device that allegedly produced a magnetic field that
  would allegedly cure the specific disease.
  <LI>Davidson falsely claimed that:
  <UL>
    <LI>He had obtained a doctorate in physics from Karl Marx University
    in Germany.
    <LI>He was a &quot;Nuclear Physics Doctor.&quot;
    <LI>He was involved in the teaching of &quot;pre-med&quot; students.
    <LI>He was a retired or former agent of the Central Intelligence
    Agency (CIA)
    <LI>He was born in Germany as a result of human breeding experiments.
  </UL>
  <LI>Davidson discouraged victims from receiving legitimate medical
  treatment by falsely representing that to severely ill cancer
  victims that conventional chemotherapy treatments interfered
  with his treatment.
  <LI>Davidson falsely represented that the cancer treatment offered
  by Macrotech was capable of exploding or imploding cancer cells
  which were then purported to have been discharged through the
  urine of the patient in the form of protein.
  <LI>The defendants used false and fraudulent statements to obtain
  money as investments or payments to purchase the rights to the
  falsely represented medical technology and medical treatments.
  Two investors signed agreements to pay a total of $2.9 million
  (not all of which was subsequently paid).
  <LI>The defendants omitted and/or fraudulently misrepresented
  material facts concerning the true nature of Macrotech and the
  defendants' qualifications, criminal history, and medical results,
  namely that:
  <UL>
    <LI>The defendants had no education, training, viable experience
    or medical credentials related to diagnosing, treating, researching,
    or administering of medical disease treatments.
    <LI>The defendants falsely claimed to have cured large numbers
    of cancer patients with Macrotech's treatments.
    <LI>Potential investors in Macrotech were not told that Davidson
    had been convicted of a felony securities fraud violation in
    Illinois.
  </UL>
  <LI>In 1995 and 1996, Davidson falsely represented to several
  patients and/or their family that the patients were cured or
  cancer-free after receiving treatment at his clinic. [Assistant
  U.S. Attorney R. Leigh Grinalds, who is prosecuting the case,
  told the Commercial Appeal reporter that all of the patients
  are dead.]
  <LI>The various schemes resulted in payments totaling $675,000
  to Macrotech.
</UL>

<P>In March 2002, Davidson pleaded guilty to one count of money
laundering and one count of mail fraud. The other five defendants
had their charges were dismissed as part of Davidson's plea agreement.
Davidson faced a minimum sentence of nearly six years in prison,
a $500,000 fine, and an order to pay $675,000 in restitution [8].
On September 13, Davisdon paid the restitution and was setnenced
to 88 months in federal prison. </P>
