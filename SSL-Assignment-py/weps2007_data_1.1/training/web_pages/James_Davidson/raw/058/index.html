<P>Thomas Davidson (1840-1900), a 
peripatetic Scottish-American scholar, was part of the emergent 
"transatlantic community of discourse" among intellectuals in the 
late nineteenth century who sought a "via media," a middle path 
between positivism and idealism.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1" TITLE="">
					[1]
				</A>
				Davidson published ten books, at 
least three-dozen articles, and displayed a unique ability to arrive 
in a city and quickly organize local intellectuals into discussion 
groups and reform organizations. There is evidence that John Dewey 
and William James were both influenced by Davidson's philosophy of 
religion and his critique of Hegel. Moreover, many British "ethical 
socialists" claimed Davidson inspired them to study American 
Transcendentalism.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn2" NAME="_ftnref2" TITLE="">
					[2]
				</A>
				Yet in spite of his accomplishments, 
historians largely ignore Davidson today. The Romantic philosophy he 
so enthusiastically developed appeared unprofessional by the close of 
the nineteenth century as philosophy moved into the Academy.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn3" NAME="_ftnref3" TITLE="">
					[3]
				</A>
				And it is true that Davidson's 
philosophical writings were generally more venturous than logically 
rigorous. Nevertheless, Davidson's ideas were influential, primarily 
because he forcefully expressed them through his charismatic 
personality and the example of his life. A full history of Davidson's 
impact is yet to be written. This essay merely begins that larger 
project with an effort to recover his life and thought.
			</P>

   <P> Davidson was born in poverty in the parish of Old Deer in Aberdeenshire,
     Scotland and grew up about a mile away in the village of 
Fetterangus. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn4" NAME="_ftnref4" TITLE="">
     [4] </A> He received his early education at the local village 
school and the
     parish school of Old Deer where the schoolmaster quickly noted 
his remarkable
     memory and facility for languages. In a brief autobiographical 
essay Davidson
     recalled that at about age twelve, Baxter's <I> Saints' Rest</I> 
lit "a divine
     fire" in his soul, "which nothing [could] ever quench." Davidson claimed he
     was "an orthodox Christian...for some years after," but "then 
came what comes
     to most serious young men of my generation, an eclipse of faith followed by
     various phases of belief and unbelief." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn5" 
NAME="_ftnref5" TITLE="">
     [5] </A> At the age of sixteen, already able to read Latin, Greek, French,
     and German, he won a scholarship to Aberdeen University. <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn6" NAME="_ftnref6" TITLE="">
     [6] </A> After graduating with honors in 1860, Davidson taught 
Latin and Greek
     for six years in Scotland and England. </P>

   <P> By way of Toronto, Davidson arrived in Boston in 1867, where he 
fell among
     "Radicals with whom [he] very cordially sympathized." The Radical Club was
     organized by Bronson Alcott and held its meetings at the home of Emerson in
     Concord. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn7" NAME="_ftnref7" TITLE=""> [7] </A> 
Davidson's relationship
     to American Transcendentalism is complex. Though he ultimately arrived at
     a philosophy that was similar to Emerson's, at this time he claimed he was
     under the spell of Comtean positivism. Nevertheless, Davidson was impressed
     by the Transcendentalists' interest in the German higher criticism of the
     Bible, which led them to emphasize the mythical and spiritual teachings of
     Christianity. Like the Transcendentalists, Davidson argued that 
Christianity
     needed to be purged of its emphasis upon "material" events and 
institutions,
     excessive doctrinal rigidity and Biblical literalism, all of 
which interfered
     with its spiritualizing power and caused a neglect of the 
religious consciousness.
     <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn8" NAME="_ftnref8" TITLE=""> [8] </A> </P>
			<P>
				In 1868 Davidson traveled to St. 
Louis where he was hired by William Torrey Harris, then 
superintendent of the St. Louis public schools, to teach Latin and 
Greek and was soon promoted to principal of a branch high school.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn9" NAME="_ftnref9" TITLE="">
					[9]
				</A>
				Davidson quickly became an active 
member of the St. Louis Philosophical Society, which had been 
organized by Henry Conrad Brokmeyer and Harris in 1866, and 
contributed many articles and translations to their
				<I>
					Journal of Speculative Philosophy.
				</I>
				Although Davidson claims that his 
"Hegelian friends" showed him "the utter hollowness and insensibility 
of [Comtean] Positivism," he never became a Hegelian himself. Denton 
Snider, the self-appointed chronicler of the St. Louis group, alleged 
that Davidson forsook Hegel after a "tussle" with the
				<I>
					Logic
				</I>
				because "he got badly thrown." 
Snider's comments may say more about his relationship with Davidson, 
than about Davidson's rejection of Hegel.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn10" NAME="_ftnref10" TITLE="">
					[10]
				</A>
				Davidson grappled seriously with 
Hegel's writings, claiming, "I think I have read everything of 
Hegel's that was ever published." It was primarily his lifelong 
commitment to individualism that led Davidson away from Hegel to 
other German philosophers, especially Schelling and Leibniz.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn11" NAME="_ftnref11" TITLE="">
					[11]
				</A>
				Schelling rekindled his interest in 
religion and encouraged him to study Plato. Leibniz's monadology 
reinforced his individualism and led him to Aristotle, who became 
"like a Mentor" to Davidson. He translated many of Aristotle's works 
and began an Aristotle society, arousing a "communal interest in the 
Greek classics" among his peers in St. Louis.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn12" NAME="_ftnref12" TITLE="">
					[12]
				</A>
			</P>
			<P>
				The St. Louis Hegelians' insistence 
on the practicality of philosophy and on democratic education 
reinforced principles Davidson already believed. The Hegelians 
insisted that speculative philosophy&#8212;which applied to fields as 
diverse as politics, history, and education&#8212;was a practical and 
personally edifying activity open to all with inquiring and critical 
minds, not merely to professionals. The Hegelians advocated 
self-education or self-cultivation (the German
				<I>
					Bildung
				</I>
				motif). For W.T. Harris this view of 
education necessitated support of formal public schooling as an 
essential process in the education of the individual toward 
productive citizenship in a democratic society.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn13" NAME="_ftnref13" TITLE="">
					[13]
				</A>
				Though Davidson was critical of 
formal education, claiming that it "stops with knowing and does not 
go on to living and doing," he was vitally concerned with the problem 
of education in a democracy and embraced the notion of 
self-cultivation. Davidson also criticized purely speculative 
philosophy, but he believed the Hegelian dialectic was an inherently 
impractical mode of thought.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn14" NAME="_ftnref14" TITLE="">
					[14]
				</A>
			</P>

   <P> Thus Davidson began to develop a critique of Hegel. In this endeavor he
     was guided by Schelling's and F. A. Trendelenburg's arguments 
that the Hegelian
     dialectic did violence to the particular facts of history and 
science by forcing
     them into a dialectical scheme rather than letting them speak for 
themselves.
     <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn15" NAME="_ftnref15" TITLE=""> [15] </A> The 
writings of Schelling
     and Trendelenburg encouraged many nineteenth-century intellectuals to seek
     a "logic of life," or of lived experience, as opposed to the formal logic
     of Kant and Hegel. Philosophical theories had to be tested by 
actual experience.
     Along this line, in 1899 Davidson claimed, "Even to this day 
there is no philosophy
     of actual experience, no working theory or norm of life, based 
upon the results
     of a carefully digested science." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn16" 
NAME="_ftnref16" TITLE="">
     [16] </A> Davidson must have been impressed by Trendelenburg's replacement
     of Hegel's monistic Absolute with Aristotle's pluralistic 
metaphysics. Though
     sympathetic to Hegel's organic view of society, in which the components of
     reality are interrelated as are the components of an organism, 
Trendelenburg
     believed Aristotelian pluralism provided a better way to account 
for the diversity
     of individual wills in society. Moreover, Davidson would 
appreciate Trendelenburg's
     critique of Ernst Haeckel's efforts to employ Darwinian biology 
in a defense
     of materialist metaphysics. Trendelenburg argued that 
materialistic metaphysics
     could not account for purpose, which was a central principle of Darwinian
     evolution, because adaptation to the environment is a means by 
which the organism
     furthers its ultimate purpose&#8212;self-preservation. <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn17" NAME="_ftnref17" TITLE="">
     [17] </A> Yet Davidson could not accept Trendelenburg's depiction of mind
     as a mere product of biological evolution. Trendelenburg sought 
to eliminate
     the philosophical dualism between mind and world by naturalizing 
mind; Davidson
     was inclined toward Schelling's Romantic spiritualization of 
nature. Schelling's
     <I> Naturphilosophie </I> appealed to many Romantics in its insistence on
     the original unity of man with nature, a unity that dissolves in 
the abstractions
     of conceptual thinking <I> (Verstand) </I> and can be recovered 
solely through
     artistic expression. Schelling's philosophy encouraged Davidson 
and the American
     transcendentalists to replace reason with feeling and scientific knowledge
     with spiritual intuition. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn18" NAME="_ftnref18" TITLE=""> [18]
     </A> </P>
			<P>
				After eight years in St. Louis, 
Davidson relocated to Cambridge in 1875, where he tutored the 
children of Transcendentalist James Eliot Cabot, befriended Henry 
Wadsworth Longfellow and William James, and with Cabot's assistance, 
revived Charles S. Peirce's Metaphysical Club.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn19" NAME="_ftnref19" TITLE="">
					[19]
				</A>
				Davidson's impact upon James was 
particularly profound. He introduced James to his future wife, Alice 
Gibbens, and it is said that Davidson imparted a "kind of fury" 
against Hegel, "to his soul's special comrade, Professor William 
James."
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn20" NAME="_ftnref20" TITLE="">
					[20]
				</A>
				Two years after Davidson's death, 
James acknowledged his influence in the
				<I>
					Varieties of Religious Experience
				</I>
				(1902).
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn21" NAME="_ftnref21" TITLE="">
					[21]
				</A>
			</P>
			<P>
				Davidson left Cambridge in 1878 in 
order to pursue his renewed interest in spirituality. Disillusioned 
with Protestantism, Davidson decided he should travel to Europe to 
begin a study of Greek Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. He spent a 
year in Athens, where he concluded that "the Greek Church...was not 
the organ of the Divine." Yet as he wandered among the ancient Greek 
ruins, Davidson had a profound religious experience. He claimed he 
"burst into tears of joy when [he] saw the glory of the ruined 
Parthenon," and at Olympia, he felt he was "in the presence of the 
Divine." From there Davidson traveled to Rome to study the Roman 
Catholic Church and medieval commentaries on Aristotle.
				<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn22" NAME="_ftnref22" TITLE="">
					[22]
				</A>
				He so impressed intellectuals in Rome 
that he was permitted to have long discussions with "Cardinals, 
Bishops [and] Abbots" and was introduced to Pope Leo XIII with whom 
he discussed philosophy in Latin in the Vatican Garden. Davidson was 
not persuaded by Catholic theology, but was deeply impressed by the 
spiritual life of devout Catholics.

<DIV CLASS="Section1">
   <P> Davidson's new fascination with the communal religious life led 
him to the
     writings of the philosopher-priest Antonio Rosmini-Serbati (1797-1855). He
     spent a year and a half in northern Italy at the Rosminian 
monastery in Domodossola.
     Davidson was attracted to Rosmini's philosophical opposition to 
both British
     Empiricism and Hegelianism and was inspired by Rosmini's central doctrine
     that "the soul has a faculty [Rosmini's "intuition"] which sees 
God, and that
     this faculty requires for its cultivation, so that it may live 
the New Life,
     a society of the nature of the church." Davidson published a 
study of Rosmini's
     thought in 1882, introducing the Italian philosopher to the 
English-speaking
     world. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn24" NAME="_ftnref24" TITLE=""> [24] </A> Yet Davidson
     was not an uncritical disciple of Rosmini. He criticized 
Rosmini's identification
     of truth with being and was unable to embrace Rosmini's Roman 
Catholic faith.
     Most of all, Davidson was impressed with the Rosminian's cooperative quest
     for a spiritual ideal. He claimed that the Rosminian order 
deepened his conviction
     that "we must not only know the truth: we must also live it. And 
we can live
     it only by establishing noble and wise social relations." <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn25" NAME="_ftnref25" TITLE="">
     [25] </A> </P>
   <P> During his sojourn in northern Italy, Davidson began to 
develop, in earnest,
     his mature philosophy. It has been described as a "form of 
pluralistic idealism...coupled
     with a stern ethical rigorism..." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn26" 
NAME="_ftnref26" TITLE="">
     [26] </A> Increasingly, he preferred to identify his philosophy 
as Apeirotheism,
     an appellation he defined as "a theory of Gods infinite in 
number." The theory
     was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of the soul and <I>
     Nous. </I> Aristotle's "soul" is the rational, living aspect of a 
living substance
     and cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a 
substance, but rather
     an essence; <I> Nous </I> is rational thought and understanding. Davidson
     argued that Aristotle's <I> Nous </I> identified God with rational thought,
     and that God could not exist apart from the world just as the Aristotlean
     soul could not exist apart from the body. Thus Davidson grounded 
an immanent
     Emersonian World Soul in a sophisticated Aristotelian 
metaphysics. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn27" NAME="_ftnref27" TITLE="">
     [27] </A> </P>
   <P> Though initially a panentheist, Davidson's studies in 
Domodossola&#8212;including
     the work of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Giordano Bruno, 
Leibniz, Kant,
     and Rosmini&#8212;led him to a panpsychistic monadology, a theory 
that reality
     consists of an infinite number of mental or spiritual substances, each with
     an Aristotelian telos. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn28" NAME="_ftnref28" 
TITLE=""> [28] </A>
     Human psyches are unique however, because they possess autonomy, 
which provides
     the potential to become divine through proper, moral association with other
     human psyches. This allowed Davidson to reject pantheism, which, 
he reasoned,
     led to a God "scattered through the universe...so that the total Absolute
     exists only in the sum of things taken together." Rather, Davidson argued,
     God exists everywhere, but he "exists fully or completely" in each monad.
     Reality is a <I> G&ouml;ttergemeinschaft, </I> a society of gods; 
metaphysical,
     social and spiritual unity is moral rather than ontological. <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn29" NAME="_ftnref29" TITLE="">
     [29] </A> </P>
   <P> Davidson's religious philosophy had important consequences for 
social thought.
     Apeirotheism was utterly democratic and perfectionistic because it entailed
     that each individual has the potential to be a God, although 
restrictive social
     relations have thwarted the development of most people's 
potential. For Davidson,
     because we contain the divine within us, our unfettered natural instincts
     would impel us to act morally. As individuals became increasingly aware of
     the divine within themselves, so they became increasingly moral. 
<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn30" NAME="_ftnref30" TITLE="">
     [30] </A> James believed this individualistic religion made 
Davidson "indifferent...to
     socialisms and general administrative panaceas." According to 
James, Davidson
     taught that "Life must be flexible. You ask for a free man and 
these Utopias
     give you an interchangeable part, with a fixed number, in a 
rule-bound social
     organism." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn31" NAME="_ftnref31" TITLE=""> [31] </A> 
Apeirotheism
     called for the release of each individual's potential divinity 
through self-cultivation
     and the nurturing of others rather than through changes in one's material
     conditions. Davidson was convinced that this release would lead to the only
     true reform of human society; it was to this task that he devoted the rest
     of his life. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn32" NAME="_ftnref32" TITLE=""> [32] </A> </P>
   <P> By 1883 Davidson was in London, where he participated in the activities
     of the Aristotelian society and founded "The Fellowship of the New Life,"
     later "The New Fellowship." For the next four years Davidson 
published little
     as he concentrated on organization and promotion of the Fellowship, which
     included among its members Havelock Ellis, Ramsay McDonald, and 
George Bernard
     Shaw. The goal of the Fellowship was to establish a "residential 
settlement"
     in which the members of the group would seek spiritual renewal 
through "brotherhood
     and education," and advance social reform through education of the broader
     community. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn33" NAME="_ftnref33" TITLE=""> [33] </A> The model
     reformer lived a heroic life of religious citizenship, 
sacrificing particular
     pleasures and advancing the divine purpose by acting for the 
common good and
     demanding heroic accomplishment from others. In so doing, 
reformers attained
     perfect freedom by acting in accord with the higher self that is 
at one with
     the divine. Specifically, the members of the Fellowship sought to 
lead a cooperative
     moral life and bring culture to ordinary Londoners through reading and art
     groups. As individuals, both within and outside of the Fellowship, attained
     this renewal, they would recognize themselves to be members of the society
     of gods and be suffused with love and sympathy for one another. 
The dominance
     of love within society would ultimately produce a spiritual 
fellowship without
     need of authority. The good society was one consisting of citizens pursuing
     their moral development through the community. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn34" 
NAME="_ftnref34" TITLE="">
     [34] </A> <O:P> </O:P> </P>
   <P> Within a short time the more politically minded members 
criticized Davidson's
     principle of "the subordination of material things to spiritual." As these
     members pressed the issue of whether 'new lifers' should engage 
in political
     activism, they formed a sister group within the new lifers, the 
Fabian Society.
     <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn35" NAME="_ftnref35" TITLE=""> [35] </A> Davidson's 
disagreements
     with the Fabians reveal a great deal about his social thought. His British
     counterparts were critical of his individualism, which they 
feared was a vestige
     of classical liberalism. Yet Davidson agreed with the Fabians' opposition
     to revolutionary Marxism because he was convinced that its focus 
on economic
     class promoted sectional interests rather than the general will 
and confined
     social reform to materialistic gains. Davidson and the Fabians 
typically saw
     the labor movement as a reformist movement based on an ethic of 
brotherhood,
     not economic class, and when they spoke of economics they usually described
     it as a moral discipline, not a science. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn36" 
NAME="_ftnref36" TITLE="">
     [36] </A> Nevertheless, because of his conviction that only 
individual, spiritual
     improvement could affect true social reform, Davidson had less interest in
     the structural and institutional elements of political economy 
than the Fabians.
     Whereas the Fabians sought to promote political dialogue, debate, and new
     legislation, Davidson condemned political disputations as petty and narrow
     squabbling that only accent differences of opinion and maintained 
that political
     action missed the mark of spiritual reform. Despite their 
disagreements, Davidson
     influenced the Fabians to study Emerson and Thoreau, instilling a 
strong ethical,
     even religious, element into their political thought. But 
Davidson ridiculed
     the Fabians for viewing themselves as followers of American 
Transcendentalism
     and as socialists, claiming that the two were thoroughly 
incompatible. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn37" NAME="_ftnref37" TITLE="">
     [37] </A> The Fellowship of the New Life survived for fifteen years after
     this split, and in 1887 Davidson went to New York where he lectured, wrote,
     and established a branch of the Fellowship. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn38" 
NAME="_ftnref38" TITLE="">
     [38] </A> </P>
   <P> Davidson also attended and lectured at Bronson Alcott's Concord School of
     philosophy (this school met from 1879-88), but finding the atmosphere too
     ethereal, he sought to establish his own school. He first 
organized a school
     in Farmington, Connecticut that met three summers (1888-1890). <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn39" NAME="_ftnref39" TITLE="">
     [39] </A> During the 1889 session, he traveled to the Adirondacks in search
     of a more suitable location for his summer school where, with the financial
     assistance of his friend Joseph Pulitzer whom he had met in St. 
Louis, Davidson
     purchased the 167 acres that became the location of "The Glenmore 
Summer School
     for the Culture Sciences." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn40" NAME="_ftnref40" 
TITLE=""> [40]

  <P> Located on East Hill of Mt. Hurricane in the Adirondack wilderness near 
    Keene Valley, Glenmore soon became a haven for intellectual pursuits. Within 
    a twelve-mile radius, William James, Felix Adler (Columbia philosophy professor 
    and co-founder of the Society for Ethical Culture), Prestonia Mann (a Fabian 
    who owned &quot;Summer Brook Farm&quot;) already owned property. Stephen F. 
    Weston (a professor at Antioch College and editor of the <i>International 
    Journal of Ethics</i>) and W.T. Harris both had cottages on Davidson's land. 
    In 1891, John Dewey purchased land across Gulf Brook from Glenmore where he 
    built a small cottage.<A HREF="TD.html#_ftn41" NAME="_ftnref41" TITLE=""> [41] </A>

   <P> More specifically, in addition to the literary topics that had been the
     focus of the Concord Summer School, the programs at Glenmore 
focused on formal

and wide-ranging
     social and political problems such as church-state relations. 
Glenmore attracted
     a wide and distinguished group of intellectuals from 1890 to

     to give public lectures, and from 1892 until his death in 1900, 
his publications
     shifted away from abstract philosophical issues to education, ethics, and
     social justice. In 1898 his defense of individualism and critique 
of socialism
     at the Educational Alliance, a settlement house, attracted the attention of
     a group of eager young men, chiefly Jewish socialists from the Lower East
     Side. It was there that a young Russian immigrant, Morris Raphael 
Cohen, first
     met Davidson. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn44" NAME="_ftnref44" TITLE=""> [44]

   <DIV CLASS="Section1"> I was not favorably impressed with his

It was apparent
     to me that the lecturer did not have any program of social action and was
     unsympathetic to any solution or procedure except that of ethical 
exhortation
     as a way of removing social evils. Completely convinced of my own premises,
     I took advantage of the question period following the lecture to heckle the
     speaker, which I continued to do in later lectures, on all 
possible and many
     impossible occasions. To my surprise Davidson did not resent my views or my
     manners but responded to my attacks in the friendliest way. <A

   <P> Cohen and his associates persuaded Davidson that he needed to clarify his
     objectives. As Davidson lectured on "The Problems Which the 
Nineteenth Century
     Hands Over, for Solution, to the Twentieth," he stressed the need 
for a liberal
     education as preparation for the new century. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn46" 
NAME="_ftnref46" TITLE="">
     [46] </A> After the lecture a young man arose and asked how "people like us
     who work nine or ten and sometimes more hours a day...who have 
few books and
     no one to guide or instruct us, [can] obtain a liberal education?" Davidson
     replied, "That is...the chief educational problem which the 
nineteenth century
     hands over to the twentieth," and much to the amazement of his audience, he
     committed one night a week to their instruction. <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn47" NAME="_ftnref47" TITLE="">
     [47] </A> Thus was born the Breadwinners' College that Davidson organized
     in association with the People's Institute and the Educational 
Alliance, again
     with the financial assistance of Joseph Pulitzer. The school 
operated evenings,
     Saturdays, and Sundays, and was designed to raise laborers to a 
higher level
     of intellectual and spiritual power by exposing them to the best culture of
     the ages. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn48" NAME="_ftnref48" TITLE=""> [48] </A> Davidson
     quickly began teaching a class in "sociology and culture, in 
accordance with
     the historical method." He described his goals as disabusing the students
     of "superficial views of a socialistic or anarchist sort," 
imparting to them
     "a healthy attitude towards society, to do away with the vengeful sense of
     personal or class wrong, and to arouse faith in individual effort and manly
     and womanly self-dependence." He hoped "to lift their lives out 
of narrowness
     and sordidness and give them ideal aims" and to "train them in the use of
     correct English, both written and spoken." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn49" 
NAME="_ftnref49" TITLE="">
     [49] </A> According to Elizabeth Flower and Murray G. Murphey, 
"Students grew
     into professionals and teachers, and the list of those associated with the
     college reads like a <I> Who's Who </I> of the next generation's 
intelligentsia
     and reformers." During the summers Davidson welcomed his best students to
     Glenmore, even providing financial assistance, where they were exposed to
     some of the best philosophical minds in the country. <A 
HREF="TD.html#_ftn50" NAME="_ftnref50" TITLE="">
     [50] </A> </P>
   <P> In the last two years of his life, Davidson elaborated his mature social
     philosophy in correspondence with Cohen. He agreed with Cohen 
"that the present
     economic condition of society is bad and needs reforming," 
however, Davidson
     believed such reform could only be accomplished "through an 
increase of social
     sympathy." He feared "economic improvement brought with moral deterioration
     or with loss of freedom" and claimed that "mere economic socialism...would
     not necessarily insure economic well-being." Finally, Davidson 
asserted "that
     any social or economic arrangements which do not carry with them the assent
     of the great mass of the people, but are <I>octroy&eacute;s </I> 
from above,
     are enslaving." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn51" NAME="_ftnref51" TITLE=""> [51] </A> In
     his "Lectures to the Breadwinners" Davidson asserted that "through want of
     education," the laboring classes are "easily cozened or bribed to vote in
     opposition to their own best interests, and so to condemn 
themselves to continued
     slavish toil and poverty, which means exclusion from all share in 
the spiritual
     wealth of the race." <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn52" NAME="_ftnref52" TITLE=""> [52] </A>
   </P>
   <P> Though Davidson's hostility to Marxism never abated, his association with
     Cohen, cut short by Davidson's death, completely changed Cohen's life. From
     1900 to 1918 the Breadwinners' College faithfully continued 
Davidson's original
     vision as the Davidson School under Cohen's direction. With the financial
     assistance of Adler's Ethical Culture Society, Cohen earned a 
Ph.D. at Harvard
     and went on to become a leading philosopher at City College until 1938, and
     a leader in the Thomas Davidson Society which was still active in New York
     City as late as 1957. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn53" NAME="_ftnref53" 
TITLE=""> [53] </A>
   </P>
   <P> At the time of his death, Davidson was deeply involved in a book that, he
     claimed, would be his magnum opus. James reminisced, "When I 
first knew [Davidson]
     all was Aristotle. Later all was Rosmini. Later still Rosmini 
seemed forgotten;
     and I never learned just what point of view replaced that 
synthesis for Davidson."
     <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn54" NAME="_ftnref54" TITLE=""> [54] </A> But it is clear that
     Davidson conceived the book as a massive work of intellectual history that
     would discredit "authoritarian" thought and demonstrate the inevitability
     and value of more democratic perspectives such as his own. His 
journals show
     that this task was one of the major preoccupations of the last twenty years
     of his life. <A HREF="TD.html#_ftn55" NAME="_ftnref55" TITLE=""> [55] </A> In 1894
     Davidson wrote that he had been working on the book for fifteen years and
     intended that winter to consult original sources of information for it in
     the libraries of London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. In 1896 he claimed, <O:P>

				Although his greatest work never 
appeared, it would have added little to Davidson's historical legacy. 
Romantic philosophy was rapidly outmoded as academic philosophers 
asserted their expertise and credibility through specialization and 
secularization. Furthermore, whereas Davidson's social activism 
focused on the poor as individuals, twentieth-century progressive 
reformers saw poverty as a social ill having many causes, a change 
inspired by the detailed investigations of the emerging social 
sciences. Davidson's individualistic ethic of spiritual renewal 
seemed naive in a rising torrent of urbanization, and institutional 
proliferation.

				Nevertheless, as James noted, "the

example he set to us all, of how&#8212;even in the midst of this 
intensely worldly social system of ours, in which every interest is

be a knight-errant of the intellectual life, and preserve freedom in 
the midst of sociability."

activities of the St. Louis Hegelians. Harris eventually became the 
first United States Commissioner of Education (1889-1906). Susan Blow 
was a leader in the Kindergarten movement. Henry Conrad Brockmeyer drafted 
the Missouri Constitution of 1875 which guaranteed education to all 
from the sixth to the twentieth year, and eventually traveled to 
northeastern Oklahoma to take Hegel to the Indians. Snider organized

     The early Metaphysical Club included Peirce, James, Oliver Wendell Holmes,

     John Fiske and Francis E. Abbot. James claimed he first heard 
Peirce enunciate
     his pragmatism in a paper read to the Metaphysical Club in the early 1870s.
     The latter Metaphysical Club included Davidson, James, Nicholas 
St. John Green,
     Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Fiske, J.D. Warner, C.C. Everett, 
George Howison,
     future professor of philosophy at Berkeley and a former associate 
of the St.
     Louis Hegelians, and G. Stanley Hall, soon to become an imminent American
     psychologist. The latter club was more formal, assigning texts (beginning
     with Hume's <I> Treatise of Human Nature </I> and proceeding on to Kant and
     Hegel) and issuing invitations. According to James, the second 
club disintegrated
     in the spring of 1879, because the members were "about talked out." Ralph
