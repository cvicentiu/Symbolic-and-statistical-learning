<B>DAVIDSON, JAMES</B>
(1834-?). James Davidson, adjutant general of Texas, was born
in Kelso, Roxburgh County, Scotland, in 1834. He received a common-school
education and was proficient in reading and writing. When he immigrated
to the United States in 1865 he claimed that after leaving school
he had served in a cavalry regiment in the British army. In 1865
he settled in Maine. In March of that year he enlisted as a second
lieutenant in an unassigned company of the Nineteenth Maine Infantry
Volunteers. He was mustered out on May 23, 1865, at which time
his commander described him as &quot;zealous, energetic and competent.&quot;
He joined the regular army the following June as a private in
Company D, Corps of Engineers. He remained with the engineers
until June 1867 and rose to the rank of first sergeant. In May
1867 he passed examinations allowing him to be appointed second
lieutenant and was assigned to the Twenty-ninth Infantry. He transferred
to the Eleventh Infantry on April 25, 1869.</P>
<P>
In 1869 the Eleventh Infantry was headquartered at
Jefferson, Texas. Davidson arrived in Clarksville and assumed
the duties of military commissioner for Red River County on June
18. In this position he achieved a reputation for strict enforcement
of military rule. He restricted the wearing of sixshooters and
other weapons in town. He actively supported efforts by the local
Freedmen's Bureau<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> agent to 
educate and protect freedmen. During his service in northeastern
Texas he became associated with prominent Republican politicians
Amos Morrill and Albert H. Latimer.<font size="-1"><sup>qqv</sup></font></P> 
<P>
Governor Edmund J. Davis<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> nominated 
Davidson adjutant general of Texas with the rank of colonel on June 24, 
1870. The Senate confirmed the nomination on July 6, and Davidson resigned 
from the United States Army with an honorable discharge. As adjutant 
general, Davidson was chief of the State Police,<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> 
which he organized quickly. He also headed the state militia and
was promoted to major general of it on March 15, 1871. His early
priority in office was the suppression of outlaws and the Ku Klux
Klan.<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> He aggressively used the 
police and the militia in his efforts and personally headed militia 
operations following declarations of martial law in Madison, Hill, 
Walker, Limestone, and Freestone counties in 1870 and 1871. Under 
his leadership the State Police forcefully hunted down criminals 
and made 978 arrests in the first month of the organization's 
existence.</P>
<P>
The State Police and the militia both were politically
controversial institutions. Democrats charged that they were instruments
of Republican tyranny. The fact that many members of both the
police and militia were black further irritated whites. While
both the militia and police received criticism, Davidson generally
avoided personal attacks. In September 1871 a disgruntled state
policeman accused him of malfeasance in procuring supplies for
the police. Though the incident received attention in Democratic
newspapers, the charges were never proved. Even among his political
opponents Davidson earned a reputation for honesty and efficiency
in operating the police and militia. When he readily complied
with conservative efforts to cut back and reorganize the State
Police after the spring of 1872 he received Democratic praise
for being one of the better members of the Davis government.</P>
<P>
On October 12, 1872, the local Republican executive
committee at Austin nominated Davidson for state senator from
the district embracing Travis County. He resigned his position
as adjutant general on November 4 to run for the office on a platform
that declared support for law and order and public education.
He also broke with the Davis administration when he pledged to
uphold the legislature's grant of state bonds to the International-Great
Northern Railroad, a position opposed by the governor. In the
election he faced Nathan G. Shelley,<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> 
and although he received some praise in Democratic newspapers
he still lost, in an election marred with charges of fraud. In
December after the 1872 election, Davidson accompanied secretary
of state James P. Newcomb<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> 
to New York City, where Newcomb had gone to sell state bonds.
In his absence, the new adjutant general, Frank L. Britton,<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> 
discovered shortages in Davidson's accounts. Davidson had drawn
warrants on the treasury for payment of State Police officers,
which the comptroller allowed without vouchers filed showing legal
services, and apparently pocketed the funds. The state immediately
ceased payment on the warrants and attached Davidson's property
to limit the potential loss. Later investigations placed the loss
at $37,434.67, although what was recovered by the seizure of Davidson's
property is not known. Governor Davis offered a reward for the
former adjutant general's return and sent Capt. Leander H. McNelly<font size="-1"><sup>qv</sup></font> 
of the State Police in pursuit. McNelly reported that Davidson
probably had left the United States, although the policeman never
determined the fugitive's location. He was later reported to have
fled to Belgium but was never found and never returned to Texas.</P>
