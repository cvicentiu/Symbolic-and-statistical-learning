0.- Introduction.

The Web People Search Task took place as part of the 4th Workshop on
Semantic Evaluations (Semeval 2007).
In the following sections we describe briefly the task, the training
and test data and the scoring program provided.

1.- WePS 2007 task definition.

This task focuses on the disambiguation of person names in a Web
searching scenario. Finding people, information about people, in the
World Wide Web is one of the most common activities of Internet
users. Person names, however, are highly ambiguous. In most cases,
therefore, the results for this type of search are a mixture of pages
about different people that share the same name.

The participant's systems will receive as input, web pages retrieved
from a web search engine using a given person name as a query. The aim
of the task is to determine how many referents (different people)
exist for that person name, and assign to each referent its
corresponding documents. The challenge is to correctly estimate the
number of referents and group documents referring to the same
individual.

2.- Training data.

The training data is composed of sets of up to 100 web pages
corresponding to the results from a web search engine (Yahoo, via its
search API) for a person name query.

The names were sampled from a list of biographies in the Wikipedia and
from the list of participants in the European Conference in Digital
Libraries.  Additionally we have included the Web03 corpus, which
is composed of names sampled from the US Census (for more details,
Gideon S. Mann, "Multidocument Statistical Fact Extraction and Fusion",
2006, Johns Hopkins University).

With this data we expect to cover at least two frequently
occurring ambiguity scenarios: very common names that have a high
ambiguity on the web, and names of famous or historical people, which
might monopolize most of the documents in the web search results. With
the ECDL names we also provide a subset of the corpus in which there
is at least one namesake from a specific domain (in this case,
researchers in digital libraries).

Each name set has a "person_name.xml" file with information about
ranking, URL, title and snippet for each retrieved web page. All the
pages have been downloaded and stored in directories named according
to their ranking in the search results.

3.- Test data

The test data for the task is composed, as in the training data, of
sets of up to 100 webpages corresponding with the results in a web
search engine (Yahoo, via its search API) for a person name query.
Each set has a separate XML file with information about ranking, URL,
title and snippet for each retrieved webpage.  All the pages have been
downloaded and stored in directories named according to their ranking
in the search results. The names where randomly extracted from the
Wikipedia, ACL 2006 Conference and US Census data.

We provide a double annotation of the test data by different
annotation teams (five human annotators in total). Each name set was
annotated by one person.
During the official evaluation period we only had access to one
annotation of the whole test data. This annotation was composed
of the combination of name set annotations from both teams.
The corresponding truth files have been provided in a separate
folder for ease of use.

4.- Gold standard

The gold standard for each person-name document set is named
"person_name.clust.xml".  It contains a root element "<clustering>"
followed by one "entity" element for each entity.  The entity element
has an identifier attribute ("id") with an integer value. Nested in
the "entity" element there are "doc" elements (pages that refer to
this particular entity), each of which has a "rank" attribute that
corresponds to the ranking information provided in the xml file
described above.  Note that a document might have been clustered in
more than one entity. This is the case when multiple person names
referring to different entities appear in a single document.  Also,
note that a person name may have a namesake that is not a person (for
instance an organization or a location). In those cases the non-person
entity will have its own cluster.  Finally, when the annotator could
not cluster a page it was included under a "discarded" element.  The
reasons for this might be the non-occurrence of the person name in the
page (probably because Yahoo index had outdated information when the
corpus was built) or simply that the human annotator could not decide
whether to cluster that page. Discarded pages are not taken into
account for the evaluation.

Here is an example of what the gold standard files looks like:

<clustering>
   <entity id="0">
       <doc rank="0"/>
       <doc rank="5"/>
   </entity>
   <entity id="1">
       <doc rank="1"/>
       <doc rank="3"/>
   &nbsp;   <doc rank="5"/>
       <doc rank="10"/>
   </entity>
   ...
   <discarded>
       <doc rank="8"/>
       <doc rank="9"/>
   </discarded>
</clustering>


Note that empty lines are permitted anywhere in the file. Space and
tab does not have special meaning anything in the file.

Some files that appear in the list of downloaded documents migth
contain no text, probably because it was not possible to download
them. Those pages where not clustered by the human annotators and
should not appear in the "clust.xml" files.

7.- WePS 2007 Scoring Package 1.1.

- version 1.1 solves an bug in the results output that was giving same value for PURITY_F05 and BCUBED_05

We include the jar file with the source code and a basic documentation.
Any suggestions, improvements or new measures are very welcomed (write
to Javier Artiles javart@gmail.com).

This program scores the performance of one or more systems
according to several optional evaluation measures.

6.- System output.

Participants are expected to provide an output clustering for each
person name set in the test set.  The format of this output should be
the same as the Gold Standard format described above.  The data output
for each person name set should be created in one separate file. The
file name should be the person name (blanks replaced by "_") with the
".clust.xml" extension.
