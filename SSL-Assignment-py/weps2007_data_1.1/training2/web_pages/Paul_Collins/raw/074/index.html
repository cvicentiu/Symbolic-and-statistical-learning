<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The news stopped me in my tracks.&nbsp;
I was on my way to dancing when I got a voice message on my pager from
my friend, Gerhard Bernhard.&nbsp; I knew that Gerhard wouldn't page me
this late in the evening unless it were something we needed to discuss
right away.&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to Gerhard's message several times before
calling him back.&nbsp; I spent the next half hour sitting in my car thnking
about the times Larry and I had spent together and about the times that
we hadn't.&nbsp; Larry had been on my mind earlier in the day.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I recalled our parting after the Door County
Folk Festival, a scant three weeks before, and our promise to get together
and do a "dance exchange", this fall, with dinner.&nbsp; This was something
we had done about twenty-five years ago when we both lived in the Hyde
Park neighborhood in Chicago.&nbsp; We talked about doing other things
too.&nbsp; But we always came back to the dance&nbsp; exchange - where
we shared some dances with each other and prepared dinner - a rabbit &amp;
rice dish from a Mexican recipe book of mine.&nbsp; We always came back
to that event and we wanted to do it again.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My last words to Larry in Door County were,
"I'll see you this summer sometime at dancing in Wauwautosa, if not sooner."
(the Milwaukee Tuesday Night Dance Group).&nbsp; I guess I'll have to wait
a while for that.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Wednesday and Thursday, I had worked
with a client who had employees from France come to Chicago for a two-day
meeting.&nbsp; One of them had been sitting on a plane on the runway at
the Orly Airport when the pilot suggested that they could get a look at
the Concorde taxiing down the runway in preparation for take off.&nbsp;
She had no idea why her plane was delayed on the runway for two hours.&nbsp;
Upon landing at O'Hare, she was finally informed about the Concorde crash.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During lunch and dinner breaks, the conversation
often turned toward the relative safety of air travel as compared with
automobile travel.&nbsp; Sometime between 1:00pm and 1:15pm on Thursday,
as we returned from lunch the conversation shifted toward Wisconsin and
for some reason I made a remark about living in Milwaukee.&nbsp; A clear
image of Larry flashed across my mind during that brief conversation.&nbsp;
The automobile accident happened about 8:00pm in France, which would be
about 1:00pm in Chicago.&nbsp; Did we connect one more time or was it a
coincidence?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most people would say that men do not really
get close to each other.&nbsp; My closest friends, Andrew Greenberg, and
David Hart, moved away from Chicago years ago, but we are still close -
closer than most men.&nbsp; We get together when we can, email when we
can and talk on the phone when we can.&nbsp; I have always considered Larry
a good friend - not my closest friend - but a good friend.&nbsp; Larry
and I have known each other since the early 1970's when he noved to Chicago.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There was a unique quality about my friendship
with Larry that I did not have with either Andrew or David.&nbsp; I do
have something that comes close with my friend Dennis Rigan, but it's not
as intense as with Larry.&nbsp; I'd say that for the last dozen or more
years, whenever Larry were at the same event we first made eye contact,
then we both broke into big smiles - knowing smiles - knowing that we were
going to have a great time together.&nbsp; This happened both at dance
and non-dance events.&nbsp; We never discussed it with each other - it
just happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; At dance events, we'd usually be the last ones
to leave the dance hall, staying up late to listen to music or to do old
dances that not too many other folks knew or to try to reconstruct dances
that neither of us could remember.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I remember a conversation Larry and I had
one summer at the Sister Bay Village Hall.&nbsp; We were lamenting the
fact that we didn't see any younger people in the international folk dance
movement following in our footsteps or coming close to us in terms of their
intensity, spirituality, enjoyment, knowledge, dedication, etc.&nbsp; Later
that evening, during the Folk Dance Olympics - a not-so-competitive "competition"
that we added to as a late night activity to the Door County Folk Festival.&nbsp;
From out of the kitchen, right under our noses danced Karla Smith and Liz
Amos.&nbsp; As Larry put it, "They are the closest thing to the old intensity,
spirit, dedication, etc. that I've seen in years!".&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Karla and Liz were extremely close.&nbsp;
However, only close enough to finish a strong second in the voting for
Olympic Champion.&nbsp; Incidentally, a strong second is the closest that
anyone has ever been able to come to defeating Larry and me in the Olympics.&nbsp;
Someone in Milwaukee once told me that after Larry and I had done some
"hotshot" dance at a Milwaukee Folk Fair after party, they had overheard
someone describing us as "twins separated at birth".&nbsp; We were a tough
act to top.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Larry contributed immensely to the spirit
and the success of the Door County Folk Festival which has evolved over
the years from the early days of searching for an identity and an audience
to the the present days of building and maintaining a community and trying
to understand how to serve that community better.&nbsp; I was flattered
and pleased when Larry talked about how much he enjoyed the camaradarie
and atmosphere at the Festival.&nbsp; He tried to plan his annual European
trips so that he would be able to attend the Festival and told me that
he always planned to attend even if he were not on the teaching staff.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Larry touched all of us in many other ways
including his virtuosity on the piano - concert-quality; his interst in
history, politics, folk culture, fine art, literature and the humanities;
his interest in photography and his passion for art history.&nbsp; I hope
that someone will publish Larry's book.&nbsp; He had worked on it so dilliligently.
Small wonder that in the late 1980's Larry seriously considered a career
in the diplomatic service.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This past Sunday, I attended the memorial
service for the father of a friend of my wife's.&nbsp; Two thoughts from
this service that rang true were:</font>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Nothing is more fleeting than the life of
a human being."</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Death is, because life is, and each is bound
to the other."</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first friend that I told about Larry's
death reminded me that events like this should reinforce the need for us
all to focus on the good things in life, to live each day to its fullest,
to focus on things that can really make a positive difference and to avoid
things are negative and/or stressful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, that sounds a lot
like the way Larry tried to lead his life.</font>
