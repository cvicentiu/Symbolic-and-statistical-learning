            class="imgRight" /><span>I</span>n the wake of hurricane Katrina,
            many within the government are ducking for cover as the blame game
            begins. One individual who has been targeted is Michael Brown, the
            director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Associated
            Press reported the following:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The top U.S. disaster official waited hours after Hurricane
              Katrina struck the Gulf Coast before he proposed to his boss
              sending at least 1,000 Homeland Security workers into the region
              to support rescuers, internal documents show.
            </p>
            <p>
              Part of the mission, according to the documents obtained by The
              Associated Press, was to ``convey a positive image'' about the
              government's response for victims.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acknowledging that such a move would take two days, Michael
              Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
              sought the approval from Homeland Security Secretary Michael
              Chertoff roughly five hours after Katrina made landfall on Aug.
              29.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before then, FEMA had positioned smaller rescue and
              communications teams across the Gulf Coast. But officials
              acknowledged the first department-wide appeal for help came only
              as the storm raged.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brown's memo to Chertoff described Katrina as ``this near
              catastrophic event'' but otherwise lacked any urgent language.
              The memo politely ended, ``Thank you for your consideration in
              helping us to meet our responsibilities.'' (No pagination)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Michael Brown is not the only one with a bull's eye on his chest.
            Former Clinton advisor Sydney Blumenthal also got in on the fun,
            placing blame squarely on the President's shoulders:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              In 2001, FEMA warned that a hurricane striking New Orleans was
              one of the three most likely disasters in the U.S. But the Bush
              administration cut New Orleans flood control funding by 44
              percent to pay for the Iraq war. (No pagination)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Many in the mainstream media have interpreted these revelations the
            same way: gross incompetence on the part of the government.
            Apparently, Uncle Sam cannot get a thing right these days. What the
            media has completely missed (or ignored) is how certain factions
            within government could use the Katrina catastrophe to introduce
            social changes previously unthinkable. There is a discomforting
            possibility that Americans must consider in light of the fact that
            there is no one else looking out for their best interest. It is the
            possibility that warnings were ignored and assistance was
            intentionally delayed to create a pretext for unprecedented
            government growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            One supporter of this contention is Paul Craig Roberts, the former
            Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. On the 5th September 2005 Alex
            Jones show, Roberts: "agreed that FEMA has deliberately withheld
            aid, and cut emergency communication lines, and automatically made
            the crisis look worse in order to empower the image of a police
            state emerging to 'save the day'" (Watson and Jones, no
            pagination). Steve Watson and Alex Jones also report:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Roberts further commented "There is no excuse for this, we have
              never had in our history the federal government take a week to
              respond to a disaster...this is the first time ever that the help
              was not mobilized in advance. The proper procedure is that
              everything is mobilized and ready to go." (No pagination)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Roberts can hardly be called a conspiracy theorist. The former
            Assistant Secretary of the Treasury has recognized a certain game
            plan at work in the Katrina situation. This game plan has been used
            for centuries. Researcher Ralph Epperson elaborates:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The first step consisted of having the conspiracy's own people
              infiltrate the government (the "pressure from above.")
            </p>
            <p>
              The second step was to create a real or alleged grievance,
              usually through either an action of government or through some
              situation where the government should have acted and didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third step consisted in having a mob created by the real or
              alleged grievance that the government or the conspiracy caused
              demand that the problem be solved by a governmental action (the
              "pressure from below.")
            </p>
            <p>
              The fourth step consisted in having the conspirators in the
              government remedy the real or alleged situation with some
              oppressive legislation. </p><p>The fifth step is a repeat of the last
              three. The government does not solve the problem and the mob
              demand more and more legislation until the government becomes
              totalitarian in nature by possessing all of the power. (37)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            If this method were fully implemented, it would be no exaggeration
            to describe the end result as being a Soviet-style America. One of
            the government agencies that have much to gain from the execution
            of this technique is FEMA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael Brown may become a sacrificial lamb. However, the Agency he
            heads, FEMA, has much to gain from the Katrina catastrophe. The
            hurricane disaster may lead to calls for increasing FEMA's budget
            and power. In a hopes of silencing his critics, the President may
            favor such a move. America would then fall back to sleep, believing
            FEMA had its back covered in the event of another disaster.
            However, several researchers have recognized that FEMA has little
            to do with emergency relief. One such individual was deceased
            researcher Jim Keith. In his book, <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1881532054/ref=ase_conspiracyarc-20/102-5485159-1789706?v=glance&amp;s=books"
             title="Black Helicopters over America: Strikeforce for the New World Order (Paperback), by Jim Keith"
             class="amz">Black Helicopters Over America</a>, Keith noted the
            following concerning FEMA:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              FEMA is intended to assume the powers of government during
              "emergencies," even to the extent of taking over the powers of
              the President, if the situation is believed to warrant it. The
              organization is located in the top secret National Security
              Agency facility in Fort Meade, Maryland. In its more benign
              aspects, FEMA is seen as an "umbrella" agency that, during times
              of disaster or natural cataclysm, will step into to throw the
              stricken populace life preservers. But there are aspects of FEMA
              which have some worried, one being that only a small percentage,
              less than 10% of FEMA employees according to a Congressional
              investigation, is engaged in anything having to do with disaster
              relief. So what the hell is FEMA doing behind those closed doors
              at Fort Meade? Among other things, the agency is engaged in
              compiling computer records on millions of Americans, to provide a
              database for CAPS, Crisis Action Programs, to be deployed
              whenever the non-elected bureaucrats of FEMA anticipate something
              which might compromise almighty COG, what they term the
              "Continuity of Government." (108)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Was Keith merely being an alarmist when he penned these words? In
            his book <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385314752/ref=ase_conspiracyarc-20/102-5485159-1789706?v=glance&amp;s=books"
             title="Triangle of Death (Hardcover), by Michael Levine"
            class="amz">The Triangle of Death</a>, former DEA agent Michael
            Levine records a conversation he had with a CIA agent that
            reinforces Jim Keith's contention:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "How can you be so good at what you do and have so little
              understanding of what really pulls your strings? Don't you
              realize that there are factions in your government that want this
              to happen - an emergency situation too hot for a constitutional
              government to handle."
            </p>
            <p>
              "To what end?" I asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              "A suspension of the Constitution, of course. The legislation is
              already in place. All perfectly legal. Check it out yourself.
              It's called FEMA. Federal Emergency Management Agency. 'Turn in
              your guns, you antigovernment rabble rousers. And who would be
              king, Michael?" (353)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In an interview with William Norman Grigg, Levine made it clear
            that this account was not fictitious:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              According to Levine, this shocking exchange is not the product of
              an imagination fed by alarmist myths. "That scenario&hellip;came from a
              specific conversation I had with a CIA officer in Argentina in
              1979," Levine informed The New American. "There was a small group
              of us gathered for a drinking at the CIA guy's apartment. There
              were several Argentine police officers there as well; at the
              time, Argentina was a police state in which people could be taken
              into custody without warning, tortured, and then 'disappeared.'"
            </p>
            <p>
              "At one point my associate in the CIA said that he preferred
              Argentina's approach to social order, and that America should be
              more like that country," Levine continues. "Somebody asked,
              'Well, how does a change of that sort happen?' The spook replied
              that it was necessary to create a situation of public fear - a
              sense of impending anarchy and social upheaval&hellip;"(11)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The lack of response on the part of the government to hurricane
            Katrina created a situation just like that described by Levine's
            CIA acquaintance. An August 31, 2005 WWLTV news report seems to
            suggest that the situation had the desired effect:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Disgusted and furious with the lawlessness of looters who have
              put fear into citizens, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared
              Martial Law in the city and directed the city's 1,500 person
              police force to do "whatever it takes" to regain control of the
              city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nagin said that Martial Law means that officers don't have to
              worry about civil rights and Miranda rights in stopping the
              looters. (No pagination)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            With the proper pretext now in place, FEMA could enter the scene.
            Lieutenant-general Carl A. Strock of the Army Corps of Engineers
            informed the press that FEMA was heading up the federal response:
            "Ultimately, the corps is directed, along with 15 other agencies,
            by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 'It is FEMA who is
            really calling the shots and setting priorities here,' General
            Strock said" (Revkin, no pagination).
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, FEMA is calling all the shots in New Orleans. In the event
            of a larger crisis, the agency's powers could be further augmented
            by Executive Order 11051. This Executive Order would allow FEMA to
            enact other Executive Orders, extending the organization's control
            over numerous state and federal functions. This control would
            overarch education, welfare, and health services (Executive Order
            11051, no pagination). In addition, FEMA would wield substantial
            authority over America's financial institutions. The agency would
            regulate wages, credit, salaries, and the flow of capital
            (Executive Order 11051, no pagination). The nation's means of
            production and distribution would also be commandeered (no
            pagination). In short, the infrastructure of the United States
            would be effectively controlled by one omnipotent governmental
            entity. FEMA is a dictator's wet dream, and with Katrina it is
            starting to be given teeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lesson to be learned from Katrina is fairly obvious. In the
            event of a catastrophe, we cannot depend on the government to be
            our savior. The politics of disaster are not about relief for the
            victims. They are about the acquisition of power.
          </p>

Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker ... The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization, to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy."<br /><strong><a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/02/21/2003294021">Richard Haass</a>, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Feb. 21st, 2006</strong></p><p>"The real danger is the gradual erosion of individual liberties
through automation, integration, and interconnection
of many small, separate record-keeping systems,
each of which alone may seem innocuous,
even benevolent, and wholly justifiable."<br /><strong>U. S. Privacy Study Commission, 1977</strong></p><p>"We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. ... It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries."<br /><strong>David Rockefeller, Bilderberg Meeting, June 1991 Baden, Germany</strong></p><p>"The very word 'secrecy' is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it."<br /><strong>John F. Kennedy in a speech before the American Newspaper Publishers Association (27 April 1961)</strong></p><div class="amzBooks">
