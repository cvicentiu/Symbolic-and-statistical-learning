<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">REASONS FOR
RESIGNATION</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>by</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Paul Collins</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After thirty three years I
have decided to resign as an ‘active' priest to&nbsp; return to being an
ordinary Catholic believer. Many people will justifiably&nbsp; ask: why?
The reason is simple: I can no longer conscientiously subscribe to&nbsp;
the policies and theological emphases coming from the Vatican and other&nbsp;
official church sources.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While the reason is straight-forward,
the decision to resign is the result&nbsp; of a personal and theological
process. This, of course, is not a step that I&nbsp; have taken lightly
and I have been considering it for some time. I will try&nbsp; to outline
the reasons in detail.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The core of the problem is
that, in my view, many in ecclesiastical&nbsp; leadership at the highest
level are actually moving in an increasingly&nbsp; sectarian direction
and watering down the catholicity of the church and even&nbsp; unconsciously
neglecting elements of&nbsp; it's teaching. Since this word&nbsp; ‘catholicity'
will recur often I will define it. It is derived from the&nbsp; Greek word
‘katholikos' which means ‘general',‘broad or ‘universal'. The&nbsp; Shorter
Oxford Dictionary defines ‘catholicity' as ‘the quality of having&nbsp;
sympathies with or being all-embracing; broad-mindedness; tolerance'.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But ‘catholicity' also has
a profound theological meaning. The recently&nbsp; appointed American Cardinal
Avery Dulles, SJ has a fine book entitled The&nbsp; Catholicity of the
Church (1988). Catholicity, he says, is characterised by&nbsp; (1) inclusiveness,
which means openness to various cultures and opposition&nbsp; to sectarianism
and religious individualism; (2) by an ability to bridge&nbsp; generations
and historical periods; (3) by an openness to truth and value&nbsp; wherever
it exists; (4) by a recognition that it is the Holy Spirit who&nbsp; creates
the unity of the church through whose indwelling we participate in&nbsp;
the life of God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is the kind of Catholicism
that I, and many others, have embraced&nbsp; throughout our lives. Its
foundations, which are deeply embedded in church&nbsp; history, were given
modern expression in the vision of the church&nbsp; articulated at the
Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. For Catholics like&nbsp; myself our
benchmark is a church that is defined as the living sacrament of&nbsp;
God's presence and the place where God's sovereignty is acknowledged,&nbsp;
expressed through a participative community of people dedicated to the&nbsp;
service of the world and characterised by collegiality and ecumenism. It
is&nbsp; precisely this image of Catholicism which I think is being distorted
by many&nbsp; at the highest level in the contemporary church. I increasingly
feel that&nbsp; being a priest places me in the position of co-operating
with structures&nbsp; that are destructive of that open vision of Catholicism
and of the faith of&nbsp; the people who have embraced it. If I am to be
true to my conscience,&nbsp; resignation seems the only option.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The fact that we are retreating
from the Vatican II vision of Catholicism&nbsp; may not be everyone's view
of what is actually taking place in the church. I&nbsp; accept that, and
I also accept that the tension between a broad, open vision&nbsp; of Catholicism
rooted in living experience, and a narrower, static&nbsp; hierarchical
view of faith, runs right through church history. It is my&nbsp; perception
that at present many in the hierarchy and some laity are moving&nbsp; increasingly
in this narrow, elitist direction. Over the last few years I&nbsp; have
watched with escalating concern as a series of documents have been&nbsp;
published by the Vatican, the last of which was the declaration of the&nbsp;
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Dominus Jesus (DJ), issued
on 6&nbsp; August 2000. DJ, which claims to protect the uniqueness of Christ,
in fact&nbsp; expresses a profoundly anti-ecumenical spirit at odds with
the sense of God'&nbsp; s grace permeating the whole cosmos. DJ gives voice
to a wider movement that&nbsp; is slowly but pervasively turning the Catholic
church inward in an&nbsp; increasingly sectarian direction. It is this
which concerns me most.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sectarianism is incompatible
with genuine catholicity. It is the antithesis&nbsp; of the kind of openness
to the world, tolerant acceptance of others and a&nbsp; sense of religious
pluralism that most thinking Catholics have been formed&nbsp; in and have
embraced over the last three or four decades. Thus many&nbsp; Catholics
find themselves involved in a corrosive disjunction between what&nbsp;
they believe and have experienced, and the views expressed at the highest&nbsp;
levels of the church. The reason is because those who claim to articulate&nbsp;
Catholic belief seem to be abandoning their ‘catholic' spirit. As a result&nbsp;
there is a turning away from the other Christian churches, and a rejection&nbsp;
of the search for common ground with the other great religious traditions.&nbsp;
Thus more and more thinking Catholics who have been educated and live in&nbsp;
pluralist, democratic and tolerant societies, find themselves in conflict&nbsp;
with church hierarchs who seem to be moving in an ever-more sectarian&nbsp;
direction.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some times there is a hankering
after a more genuinely Catholic approach -&nbsp; as you find in John Paul
II's encyclical Ut unum sint (1995), where he went&nbsp; so far as to ask
the other churches for advice on papal primacy. But&nbsp; ecclesiastical
reality indicates that this hankering is, in fact, merely&nbsp; ecumenical
wishful- thinking, while the hierarchical reality is exclusivist.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There have also been regular
attempts to ‘muzzle' and condemn the discussion&nbsp; of issues such as
the ordination of women through the use of a new category&nbsp; of doctrine.
This has received its clearest expression in the apostolic&nbsp; letter
Ad Tuendam Fidem (30 June 1998). The letter argues that there is an&nbsp;
intermediary, ‘second-level' of revealed doctrine between the established&nbsp;
and defined teaching that all Catholics believe, and what up until now
has&nbsp; been called the ‘ordinary magisterium'. Before the introduction
of this&nbsp; so-called ‘second-level', all non-infallible or non-defined
teaching was&nbsp; exactly that: doctrine that should be respected and
offered various levels&nbsp; of submission of mind and will, but still
ultimately open to debate,&nbsp; discussion and development within the
Church community.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What Ad Tuendam Fidem has
done is to introduce formally through this&nbsp; ‘second-level' a category
of ‘definitive' but non-infallibly-defined&nbsp; doctrine. Cardinal Josef
Ratzinger says that this second-level&nbsp; teaching is,&nbsp; in fact,
infallible. He says that it includes ‘... all those teachings in&nbsp;
the dogmatic or moral area which are necessary for faithfully keeping and&nbsp;
expounding the deposit of faith, even if they have not been proposed by
the&nbsp; magisterium as formally revealed'. As examples of&nbsp; second-level
definitive&nbsp; teaching he includes the condemnation of euthanasia, the
validity of the&nbsp; canonization of a particular saint, the legitimacy
of a papal election, and&nbsp; even the invalidity of Anglican orders.
The gratuitous reference to&nbsp; ‘Anglican orders' is astonishingly maladroit
and insulting; it reveals a&nbsp; real lack of ecumenical sensitivity.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is also an emerging
unspoken assumption among some very senior church&nbsp; leaders that the
contemporary western world is so far gone in individualism,&nbsp; permissiveness
and consumerism that it is totally impervious to church&nbsp; teaching.
Claiming to assume the broader historical perspective, these&nbsp; churchmen
have virtually abandoned the secularised masses, to nurture&nbsp; elitist
enclaves which will carry the true faith through to future, more&nbsp;
‘receptive' generations. This is why the New Religious Movements (NRMs)
have&nbsp; received so much favour and patronage in this papacy. The NRMs
have embraced&nbsp; an essentially sectarian vision of Catholicism, are
very hierarchical in&nbsp; structure and theologically reactionary. This
is true of some elements in&nbsp; the Catholic charismatic movement, and
also outfits like Opus Dei, Communion&nbsp; and Liberation, the Neo-Catechuminate
and the Legionaries of Christ, as well&nbsp; as a number of other smaller,
less significant groupings.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Over the years my public
disquiet with increasing papal centralism and the&nbsp; erosion of the
vision of a more ecumenical Catholicism is well known,&nbsp; especially
in Australia. I have often been critical of the church's&nbsp; leadership,
perhaps too harshly at times, in books, broadcasts, talks and&nbsp; articles.
I have been concerned with ecclesiastical narrowness and the de&nbsp; facto
denial of catholicity. But I also constantly argued that it was only&nbsp;
by ‘staying in' the priesthood that someone like myself could influence&nbsp;
things and bring about change. But it was always an every-day decision
to&nbsp; continue the struggle through the internal structures of the church.
And&nbsp; there can come a moment when you decide that both conscientiously
and&nbsp; strategically ‘staying in' no longer remains a viable or honest
option. You&nbsp; realise that you can no longer collude in what is happening
by remaining in&nbsp; the official priesthood.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While important, life-changing
decisions may seem sudden to outsiders, and&nbsp; even some times to the
person who makes them, that is rarely the case. Such&nbsp; conclusions
are more likely to be the product of long unconscious reflection&nbsp;
on an issue. Slowly the connections, inferences and directional movement
in&nbsp; which the internal and unarticulated argument has been progressing
comes&nbsp; into consciousness. Often it will be a single event that focusses
your&nbsp; thought and impels you toward a decision. Suddenly you realise
that, in&nbsp; conscience, you can no longer allow your name to be associated
with what is&nbsp; happening. Of course, your judgement may be wrong, frighteningly
so, but the&nbsp; Catholic tradition has always been that you must follow
even an erroneous&nbsp; conscience. Certainly&nbsp; you must do everything
you can to ascertain what is&nbsp; really happening and what your obligations
are, but in the end you must be&nbsp; true to conscience.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What helped to focus my mind
was the article ‘Catholic Fundamentalism. Some&nbsp; Implications of Dominus
Jesus for Dialogue and Peacemaking' by my friend,&nbsp; John D'Arcy May.
[The article is one of a series of essays in the book,&nbsp; Dominus Jesus.
Anstoessige Wahrheit oder anstoessige Kirche edited by&nbsp; Michael Rainer].
DJ is primarily directed against those Catholics involved&nbsp; in the
‘wider ecumenism' who have been trying to find common ground with the&nbsp;
great non-Christian religious traditions. But DJ also managed&nbsp; to
offend&nbsp; many Anglicans and Protestants through an awkwardly-worded
passage that was&nbsp; so obscure that many journalists incorrectly took
it to mean that only&nbsp; Catholics could be saved. The passage actually
says that Anglicanism and the&nbsp; various forms of Protestantism ‘are
not churches in the proper sense'(DJ,&nbsp; Paragraph 17).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It was the opening sentences
of May's commentary that struck me between the&nbsp; eyes. "There is no
reason, in principle, why the Roman Catholic church,&nbsp; despite its
enormous size and global presence, could not become a sect.&nbsp; Sectarianism
is a matter of mentality, not size ... The deep shock Dominus&nbsp; Jesus
caused in ecumenical circles consisted precisely in their exposure to&nbsp;
the specifically Roman Catholic form of fundamentalism". This put into
words&nbsp; what I had unconsciously concluded but had not articulated.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is precisely this movement
in a sectarian and fundamentalist direction&nbsp; with which I profoundly
disagree. A person with a public commitment like a&nbsp; priest is bound
in conscience to ask: ‘Can I continue to co-operate with&nbsp; this kind
of regime in the church?' I feel bound in all honesty to say now:&nbsp;
‘No. I cannot'. But I emphasise this does not mean that I have the slightest&nbsp;
intention of leaving the community of the Catholic church, nor of abandoning&nbsp;
my work in writing and media, as long as that is available to me.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But there is also a second
constellation of reasons that have led to my&nbsp; resignation. They centre
around the book Papal Power (1997) which is&nbsp; currently being examined
by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&nbsp; (CDF), that part
of the papal bureaucracy that deals with Catholic belief. I&nbsp; have
consistently tried to keep this so-called ‘examination' in perspective&nbsp;
and have not treated it too seriously. However, it is clear to me that
the&nbsp; CDF is moving toward an escalation of the issue. This inevitably
involves&nbsp; other people. The CDF demands that all correspondence with
me pass through a&nbsp; third party, the Superior General of my religious
order, the Missionaries of&nbsp; the Sacred Heart (MSCs). This means that
my superiors and the order will be&nbsp; caught in any cross-fire between
the CDF and myself. I do not wish to put&nbsp; them in this position.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>On 14 December 2000 the current
Superior General of the MSCs, Father Michael&nbsp; Curran, was summoned
to a meeting in the Palazzo of the Holy Office in the&nbsp; Vatican. This
meeting happened totally without my knowledge and I only found&nbsp; out
about it five weeks later. At the meeting Father Curran was asked why I&nbsp;
had not responded to three issues raised in a letter from the CDF sent
to me&nbsp; via Curran and my Australian superior in April 1999. He responded
by&nbsp; providing the CDF with an article I had written in a theological
magazine&nbsp; called Compass responding to the CDF's concerns. He felt
the article ‘would&nbsp; go a long way to answering' the CDF's questions.
In the course of the&nbsp; discussion reference was also made to a mildly
critical media statement&nbsp; about the CDF that I had made, which was
briefly reported in the US National&nbsp; Catholic Reporter (16 July 1999).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Ratzinger claimed in a subsequent
letter to Curran (18 December 2000) that&nbsp; my critical comments ‘may
put [my] alleged adherence to magisterial teaching&nbsp; in question'.
In other words, even if my theological answers in the Compass&nbsp; article
were found to be satisfactory, the comments in the NCR would show&nbsp;
that I had not really repented because I was still criticising the CDF
after&nbsp; writing the Compass article.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>However, the Cardinal's chronology
was wrong. His comments make it clear&nbsp; that he believes that the NCR
interview was published after the Compass&nbsp; article. In fact, the 16
July, 1999 NCR interview was published several&nbsp; months before the
spring 1999 edition of Compass. I suppose you could&nbsp; forgive the Cardinal
for not remembering that spring in the southern&nbsp; hemisphere comes
in September-October, and not in April-May as in the&nbsp; northern hemisphere.
The Compass interview was published in the southern&nbsp; spring of 1999,
which was October-November. That is some three or four&nbsp; months after
the July NCR article.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Be that as it may, the whole
tone of Ratzinger's letter to Curran makes it&nbsp; obvious that the CDF
is preparing to censure me because the Cardinal's&nbsp; comments clearly
prejudge the issue. The constant difficulty in dealing with&nbsp; the CDF
is that your accusers are also your judges. An accused person is not&nbsp;
even allowed to choose their own defence counsel; they are not even&nbsp;
permitted to know the counsel's name.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This situation with the CDF
will
be exacerbated even more when a new book&nbsp; that I have edited is published
in March in Australia and in the northern&nbsp; spring of 2001 in London
and New York. It is entitled From Inquisition to&nbsp; Freedom. It consists
of interviews that I put together with six people who&nbsp; have also been
‘investigated' by the CDF. Those participating in it are&nbsp; Tissa Balasuriya,
Hans K&uuml;ng, Charles Curran, Lavinia Byrne, Jeannine&nbsp; Gramick,
and Robert Nugent, as well as myself. I have contributed two other&nbsp;
essays, the first outlining the history of how the Roman Inquisition&nbsp;
eventually evolved into the CDF, and a second describing and critiquing
the&nbsp; details of the Congregation's procedures. While the tone of the
book is&nbsp; respectful and moderate, I don't think it will win friends
and influence&nbsp; people in Rome. I foresee considerable problems. The
most important of these&nbsp; are that the book will eventually place Father
Curran particularly, and the&nbsp; MSCs generally, in the likely position
of being forced by the CDF to take&nbsp; some form of punitive action against
me.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I have no doubt that the
Congregation will not go away, and that they will&nbsp; not let this matter
rest. As the experience of the six other people in the&nbsp; new book makes
abundantly clear, there is never any form of dialogue. The&nbsp; Congregation
simply demands that a person not only submit to what they&nbsp; define
as ‘doctrine', but they are determined that you actually use the&nbsp;
words that they dictate. I knew exactly what I was doing when I edited
From&nbsp; Inquisition to Freedom, but I thought it was important these
stories be told&nbsp; for they expose the injustice of the CDF's procedures
and their persecution&nbsp; of people who are clearly concerned to live
a truly Catholic life and to&nbsp; give ministerial and theological leadership
to others. But there is also no&nbsp; doubt that the book will lead to
a further exacerbation of my relationship&nbsp; with the CDF, and that
the order and Father Curran will be caught in the&nbsp; middle. My resignation
will to some extent save them from that.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Finally, I want to make it
absolutely clear that my resignation does not&nbsp; mean that I have any
intention whatsoever of leaving the Catholic church. I&nbsp; am just changing
status in the family. Catholicism is my home and I have no&nbsp; intention
of leaving - come what may.&nbsp;</font></font>
