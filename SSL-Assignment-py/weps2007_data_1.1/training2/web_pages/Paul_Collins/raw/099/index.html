<p><b>CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH</b>
<br>Observations on
<br><b><i>Papal Power: A Proposal for Change in Catholicism's Third Millennium</i></b>
<br>Fr. Paul Collins, M.S.C.
<br>(Harper/Collins Fount Paperbacks, 1997)</center>

<p><b>I. Object</b>
<p>The book is primarily a critique of papal primacy and the ordinary magisterium
(cfr. p. x; p. 59).&nbsp; The author uses the term "papalism" to refer
to the contemporary exercise of the papacy, defining it as "the conflation
of all teaching authority, with an exaggerated notion of primacy" (p. 3).&nbsp;
He claims that the contemporary papacy distorts the structure of the Church
as it has been traditionally understood (p. 29).&nbsp; As a solution, the
author proposes a more democratic model for the Church: "there is a true
sense in which the Church is a democracy ... a democratic model is much
closer to New Testament forms of the Church" (p. 191).&nbsp;
<p><b>II. Method</b>
<p>The author launches his critique from "a historical and practical perspective"
(p. 5).&nbsp; However, he appears to read Church history out of context,
looking for proof texts to support his thesis that the primacy of the Roman
Pontiff is not rooted in Divine Revelation but in secular political models.&nbsp;
In addition, the book contains not a few historical inaccuracies.&nbsp;
<p>The author's use of theological sources is slanted, drawing from like-minded
theologians, but failing to cite those who oppose and refute them.&nbsp;
<p><b>III. Doctrinal Problems</b>
<p>In general, the author's presentation implies that a true and binding
Revelation does not not exist.&nbsp; The following is a list of some of
the specific doctrinal problems contained in the book:&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<u>Sacred Tradition</u>&nbsp; The author's concept of Tradition is more
than nebulous.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>"There are, of course, within Christianity a number of traditions,
different ways of comprehending and living the Christian faith.&nbsp; There
is the Orthodox tradition, the Roman Catholic tradition, the Anglican tradition
... and other Protestant traditions: all emphasize specific aspects of
the totality of Christian faith, while retaining much in common with the
other traditions" (p. 128).&nbsp;
<p>"...it is quite clear from our historical studies that Constance is
far closer in its ecclesiology to the early Church than is Vatican I. So
the contemporary Church is clearly faced with the possibility that the
teaching of Vatican I might not be in accord with tradition" (p. 216).</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Ecclesiology</u>&nbsp; The author appears to deny the identity of the
Church of Christ with the Catholic Church, suggesting a reunion of Christians
characterized by indifferentism.&nbsp;</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>"Clearly the aim (<i>of ecumenical endeavors</i>) will be the reunion
of Christendom, but not in the sense of one church entering into corporate
union with another.&nbsp; To move in this direction would to be to run
the risk of the largest church (Western Roman Catholicism) swallowing up
many of the others.&nbsp; We need to maintain the richness and diversity
of the Christian traditions.&nbsp; What is really called for is a mutual
recognition of each other's traditions, ministries, and structures, and,
on the basis of that, an entry into full inter-communion.&nbsp; In this
scenario all the churches would remain corporate entities ... there would
full recognition of each other as legitimate Christian churches" (p. 199).</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Ordinary and universal magisterium</u>&nbsp; The author holds an erroneous
concept of infallibility, in as much as he only conceives of it in its
solemn and ex cathedra manner, thus excluding the infallibility of the
ordinary and universal Magisterium.&nbsp;</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>"The pope and Ratzinger have turned what is simply a serious teaching
of the pope (what Vatican I would call 'ordinary magisterium') into an
'infallible' teaching (<i>the reference is to <b>Ordinatio sacerdotalis</b>
and the <b>Responsum ad dubium</b></i>).&nbsp; This seems to me to border
on heresy and be a denial of conciliar teaching" (p. 19).&nbsp;
<p>"'Ordinary magisterium' has been used as a catchall phrase for virtually
all papal teaching.&nbsp; The ordinary magisterium is now being conflated
by the Vatican with the infallible magisterium" (p. 52).&nbsp;
<p>"... the real issue (<i>with <b>Humanae vitae</b></i>) was papal power
and not the question of the moral status of contraception ... today we
see clearly that everything was sacrificed to preserve papal power" (pp.
87-88).&nbsp;
<p>"Most theologians argue that <b><i>Humanae vitae</i></b> is an exercise
of the ordinary magisterium.&nbsp; But the problem is that John Paul clearly
thinks that it is infallible... (<i>Vatican I</i>) made it clear that the
'charism of infallibility' only operated under the most restricted and
solemn circumstances.&nbsp; Infallibility cannot be somehow interjected
into the 'universal ordinary magisterium '" (p. 106).&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Theological notion of reception</u>&nbsp; The author maintains that
in order for a teaching to become a doctrine of the Church it is first
debated by theologians and decided on by Bishops, but then it must also
be accepted or received by the <i>congregatio fidelium</i>.</li>

<ol>"The context of all teaching authority is the <i>sensus fidelium</i>.&nbsp;
This 'sense of the faithful' is difficult to define precisely, but it refers
to the actual acceptance of beliefs by Christians down through the centuries.&nbsp;
It is linked to the doctrine of reception, which holds that if the Christian
community accepts a teaching <b>then</b> that teaching is confirmed.&nbsp;
If the teaching is not received, then it can be said that it is not the
teaching of the Church" (p. 16; cfr. p. 19, pp. 29-30, p. 63, p. 127, p.
175).</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Modernism</u>&nbsp; The author attacks the condemnation of modernism,
failing to understand its true harm (cfr. pp. 23-29).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Conciliarism</u>&nbsp; The author cites the Council of Constance as
affirming the notion of conciliarism, when in fact it did not affirm the
superiority of the council over the Pope.&nbsp; The author further maintains
that the Council of Basel later confirmed the superiority of the council
over the Pope, failing to mention is that the "three propositions" of the
Council of Basel ("<i>quod vere conventiculum esse diximus </i>") were
condemned not only because they were contrary to the genuine sense of Sacred
Scripture, but also because they were contrary to the Council of Constance
(cfr.&nbsp; Concilium Florentinum, Sess.&nbsp; VII, 4. ix. 1439, <i>Decr.
Concilii Florentini contra synodum Basiliensem</i>).&nbsp; The author claims
that <b><i>Dignitatis humanae</i></b> from Vatican II is a contradiction
of <b><i>Mirari vos</i></b> from Gregory XVI and, therefore, an example
of "a council correcting the papacy" and not of development of doctrine
(p. 22).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>"Am I advocating conciliarism?&nbsp; I would certainly admit that I
lean strongly in that direction in light of the present papalist dominance
of the Church.&nbsp; My position would be viewed by some Catholics as doctrinally
untenable" (p. 204).&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Arguments against the Primacy</u>&nbsp; The author appears to reject
papal primacy by suggesting that the Council Fathers of Vatican I were
not allowed to act freely, and that the required moral unanimity among
the minority Bishops was lacking (cfr. pp. 115-116).&nbsp; He concludes
that both primacy and infallibility represent only the triumph of a certain
"theological school", and is not in accord with Tradition (cfr. p. 216).&nbsp;
He says that the place of the Supreme Pontiff in relation to other Bishops
is "<i>primus inter pares</i>" (cfr. p. 16 1).&nbsp; The author rejects
the <i>plenitudo potestatis</i> of the Roman Pontiff, claiming that it
is a juridical term that has its roots in the Bull <b><i>Unam sanctam</i></b>
and not in Divine Revelation.&nbsp; According to the author,&nbsp; <i>plenitudo
potestatis</i> is the cause of the erroneous identification of the Church
with the Pope: "the pope equals the Church, and the Church equals the pope"
(p. 57).</li>

<center><b>A LETTER TO ARCHBISHOP TARCISIO BERTONE,&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>SECRETARY OF THE CONGREGATION FOR THE&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH</b></center>

<p><br>
<p>PO BOX 4053,&nbsp;
<br>MANUKA.&nbsp; ACT. 2603.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>20 April 1998.&nbsp;
<p>Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone,&nbsp;
<br>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,&nbsp;
<br>Palazzo del S. Uffizio,&nbsp;
<br>00120 Citta del Vaticano.&nbsp; Vatican City State.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dear Archbishop Bertone,&nbsp;
<p>Re: Your ref. 96/82-05519&nbsp;
<p>Unfortunately, I have not received any response from you to my letter
of two and a half months ago.&nbsp; So, as a gesture of my willingness
to participate in some form of reasonable discussion of the concerns your
Congregation has with my book <b><i>Papal Power</i></b>, I have decided
to initiate the dialogue by responding to the <b><i>Observations</i></b>
of your anonymous consulter.&nbsp; However, because of my commitment to
open discussion of these issues I wish to reiterate that I will make this
letter public.&nbsp;
<p>But before addressing specific issues, I think it is important to mention
firstly some of the unanswered questions involved in what is now being
called in Australia "the Collins case".&nbsp; I still remain ignorant of
who it was who delated my book to your Congregation.&nbsp; Subsequent events
in Australia have suggested to me, and to a number of other informed people
here, that one or other of the bishops may have played a role in the delation,
but because your process protects accusers, one cannot say definitely and
we may be entirely wrong in our suspicions.&nbsp;
<p>The serious problem with anonymous denunciation is that it breeds suspicion.&nbsp;
Accusers act in the dark and do not have to assume moral responsibility
for what they do, so there is an inevitable perception of injustice.&nbsp;
I am obliged to answer publicly for my book, but they can act silently,
without having to assume any public responsibility for their attacks on
me and my perceived opinions.&nbsp;
<p>Let us now turn to the consulter's <b><i>Observations</i></b>: When
I first received the <b><i>Observations</i></b> I showed them to an Anglican
friend, a theologian unacquainted with the ways of the Roman bureaucracy.&nbsp;
He commented that the <b><i>Observations</i></b> were written as though
<b><i>Papal Power</i></b> was written in a vacuum and had no relationship
to me.&nbsp; He went on to say that the book was the product of my experience
and ministry and some knowledge of that would be needed to make a mature
judgement of it.&nbsp;
<p>This notion of context is the second point that I want to emphasise
with you.&nbsp; The book emerges from my life and ministry which, for the
last two decades has been lived out in an attempt to explain some of the
riches of the Catholic tradition for those educated Catholics who are struggling
to remain intellectually honest in the church, or for those who no longer
find that the church meets their intellectual needs.&nbsp; I have also
tried to speak to the broader educated community that, perhaps unfairly,
often sees the Catholic church as an outdated rump focused only on the
issues of sexuality and social conservatism.&nbsp; Because of the way we
Catholics often present ourselves in Australia, the richness and breadth
of the tradition of Catholicism has been lost, and we are perceived in
public discourse as a church with a very blinkered vision.&nbsp;
<p>The context of my attempt to communicate with the people of today has
been the media - radio, TV and, to an increasing extent, the written word.&nbsp;
I do not think it would be immodest to say that I have had some success.&nbsp;
This was acknowledged by one prominent Australian Catholic theologian who,
when commenting on my contretemps with your Congregation, said: "Paul Collins
has won a sympathetic hearing for Christian positions among people who
would normally class themselves as the 'educated despisers of religion'
... [and] has attracted many young people who had assumed that the church
has nothing to say on the issues of the day".&nbsp;
<p>Thus the book has a context, but your consulter seemingly regards it
as though it existed in the abstract.&nbsp; His <b><i>Observations</i></b>
would have had more credibility with fair-minded people if they had an
introduction saying something like: "This is who Paul Collins is and this
is what he has tried to do. Now let's look at the book in the light of
that".&nbsp; Instead, there is an attempt at a kind of "objectivity" that
proceeds as though I did not exist.&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Papal Power</i></b> is not, and was never meant to be, an academic
treatment of theological issues.&nbsp; It is popular theology written for
an intelligent lay audience.&nbsp; In the book I explicitly say that I
am not a theologian (p 5) and I make it clear that my approach is both
historical and practical.&nbsp; This, of course, does not excuse me from
being doctrinally and historically accurate.&nbsp;
<p>Interestingly, if you read them carefully, most of the criticisms of
your anonymous consulter are actually <b><i>inferences drawn from the book</i></b>
rather than clear statements of mine that have been found to contain specific
doctrinal problems.&nbsp;
<p>The book is also explicitly ecumenical in intention and is directed
to members of the other Christian churches.&nbsp; In <i>Papal</i>
<br><i>Power</i> I have tried to explain as openly as possible the Catholic
doctrines of ecclesial governance, while remaining true to the tradition,
as a gesture of openness toward those Christians separated from us.&nbsp;
I believe that my approach in many ways mirrors the approach taken in official
ecumenical dialogues, which are often sponsored by the Holy See.&nbsp;
<p>The<b><i> Observations </i></b>begin by saying that "the book is primarily
a critique of papal primacy and ordinary magisterium".&nbsp; This is simply
a completely mistaken reading of the book.&nbsp; It is much broader than
that.&nbsp; It fundamentally attempts to deal with the major structural
issues facing the Catholic church today and makes suggestions as to how
we might move as a church community into the future.&nbsp; In the process
<b><i>Papal Power</i></b> deals with issues such as Christian leadership
in the New Testament and the early church as a model for today (pp 139-143;
149151), the churches and ecumenism (pp 111-117), the collegiality of bishops
(pp 14-20; 185-187), councils and the future of the church (pp 197-203),
the role of theologians (pp 15-20), priestly celibacy (pp 101-103), and
much more.&nbsp;
<p>At first sight one of the most extraordinary comments made by your consulter's
<b><i>Observations</i></b> is that my "presentation implies that a true
and binding revelation does not exist". (Note well, he uses the word "implies".&nbsp;
As I said above, we are dealing here with an inference, not a fact).&nbsp;
At first I could not believe that I was reading this.&nbsp; Excuse my bluntness,
but I found that an insulting comment, given that the man making it was
hiding behind a mask of anonymity, and that he was a person who clearly
knew nothing about me.&nbsp;
<p>I have spent much of the last two decades of my life standing up for
the Catholic church in public life in Australia, often having to face hard
questions in the media, for example in the area of clerical sexual abuse.&nbsp;
There have not been many of us who have stood up and been counted in public
as people explicitly committed to the Catholic church.&nbsp; I am sure
you can understand that to have someone chosen by the Holy See to then
imply that I do not believe in the truth of Christianity is rather hard
to take.&nbsp;
<p>It was only when I cooled down that I realised that much in the <b><i>Observations</i></b>
could be explained by the fact that your consulter and I are coming from
different starting points.&nbsp;
<p>I am a Catholic believer, indeed a passionate one, but for me faith
is always lived out within the context of history.&nbsp; Thus our theological
understandings are always determined and limited by the constraints of
culture and human experience.&nbsp; We can never exhaust in any one theological
approach or statement the transcendent and mysterious realities that underlie
and give context to our beliefs.&nbsp; Among these realities is the church,
whose mystery we are constantly challenged to explore.&nbsp; My belief
is that in all of this the Holy Spirit of God is alive and active, constantly
guiding the church.&nbsp; Our understanding of ultimate mystery is always
developing.&nbsp;
<p>Something of this was well expressed recently here in Australia by Father
Kevin Dance, CP.&nbsp; He is the President of the Australian Conference
of Leaders of Religious Institutes, and commenting on "the Collins case",
and another public ecclesiastical dispute here, he said: "The Catholic
church is committed to truth, but discovering truth is a process not an
accomplishment.&nbsp; Truth is dynamic, not static".&nbsp; Exactly !&nbsp;
<p>What I try to do in <b><i>Papal Power</i></b>, albeit in terms of popular
theology, is to examine something of the development of the structure and
government of our church.&nbsp; For me change and development, inspired
and guided by the Holy Spirit, is part of the process of belief.&nbsp;
However, I would also maintain that there is an organic and continuous
development that occurs in, through, and often despite the vagaries of
church history.&nbsp;
<p>Your consulter, however, clearly emerges from a different theological
perspective.&nbsp; Here faith is seen in a more normative, static sense
- and I do not use the word "static" in a derogatory way.&nbsp; He seemingly
proceeds from the assumption that the profound mysteries at the core of
faith can be clearly expressed within a specific theological tradition,
and that the development of doctrine is an almost logical process within
that context.&nbsp; The process is largely outside and beyond the realities
of history.&nbsp;
<p>I would suggest that Cardinal John Henry Newman's notion of the development
of doctrine is actually closer to the historical view of faith.&nbsp; Catholic
Christianity has never been a religion of static law and unchanging doctrine,
established once and for all in the past and true for ever.&nbsp; Taken
to its logical conclusion, this is fundamentalism.&nbsp;
<p>Newman argues in his <b><i>Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine</i></b>
that the church's inner life is like an idea that is continually clarified
and expanded by development and growth.&nbsp; His profound historical sense
led him unerringly to the realisation that the more the church grows, develops
and changes, the more it becomes truly itself.&nbsp; He concludes his extraordinary
image of the river in the <b><i>Essay on Development</i></b> with the famous
statement: "Here below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have
changed often".&nbsp;
<p>When discussing my "method" your consulter says that I read church history
out of context, that there are "not a few historical inaccuracies" in the
book, and that I look for proof texts "to support [my] thesis that the
primacy of the Roman pontiff is not rooted in divine revelation but in
secular political models".&nbsp;
<p>Now, Archbishop Bertone, I think it is important to get this on the
record: I certainly do not deny that the Roman primacy is part of divine
revelation.&nbsp; Your consulter does not seem to have read the book carefully.&nbsp;
For example, I say unequivocally on page 150: "The Petrine text is clear
that the leadership of the church was conferred on Peter and it is also
demonstrable that there was a strong early tradition of identifying the
bishop of Rome with Peter... In fact, as [Father J.M.R.] Tillard points
out, the notion of Petrine succession is far more significant than is generally
recognised today.&nbsp; He argues that there is an almost sacramental sense
in which Peter lives on in his see of Rome" (p 150).&nbsp;
<p>It is clearly spelled out in the book that I believe in the continuation
of Petrine primacy through Roman primacy.&nbsp; Any other reading is a
distortion of my position.&nbsp; Certainly, I am critical of the First
Vatican Council's definition of primacy precisely because it is couched
in canonical, legal terms and has actually neglected the rich theology
of primacy that can be found especially in the first millennium of church
history.&nbsp; But criticism of a conciliar text - and I am not alone in
this criticism - is not tantamount to rejection.&nbsp; My point about Vatican
I is that it did not take church history sufficiently into account.&nbsp;
<p>Now, I concede that <b><i>Papal Power</i></b> is not a complete history
of the papacy and that I choose material to support my (perfectly reasonable
and verifiable) argument that the gradual process of over-centralisation
of control has brought about a dysfunctional situation in the contemporary
church.&nbsp; But the practical problem that my publishers faced is that
they had to work within the constraints of size and price when putting
out a book such as mine.&nbsp; You can't say everything in one work.&nbsp;
<p>Let us now turn to the specific problems with the book that your anonymous
consulter mentions.&nbsp;
<p>First he says that "the author's concept of tradition is more than nebulous"
and then refers to passages on p 128 and p 216.&nbsp; Again, I have this
feeling that he has not read the book carefully.&nbsp; I talk specifically
about tradition in pp 125 to 130.&nbsp; I define tradition not as the static
process of merely repeating the past, but as a dynamic process of handing
on the faith.&nbsp; Then I say: "Catholics take tradition as a source and
norm of faith.&nbsp; God, Catholic theology says, reveals God's self to
us through the Bible and through the tradition of the church.&nbsp; But
tradition has never been definitively defined.&nbsp; Probably it cannot
be: it is one of those dynamic concepts that defies definition" (p 126).&nbsp;
<p>The argument then goes on to reject the post-Tridentine idea of tradition
as the articulation of the unwritten teachings of Jesus.&nbsp; I then emphasise
the creative element in tradition and stress that tradition is more about
process than content.&nbsp; It is here that we strike again the problem
mentioned above: my approach is explicitly historical.&nbsp; My position
is that doctrinal truth works itself out in the processes of church history
under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, whereas your consulter seemingly
has a more static view.&nbsp; All that I have said is in complete harmony
with Vatican II's Dei Verbum.&nbsp;
<p>This leads us logically to the second criticism of your consulter.&nbsp;
His <b><i>Observations</i></b> say that I "appear to deny the identity
of the Church of Christ with the Catholic Church, suggesting a reunion
of Christians characterised by indifferentism".&nbsp; Here again we are
dealing with an inference: I "appear" to deny.&nbsp; But when you read
the passage he quotes from p 199 I simply talk about "the richness and
diversity of the [other] Christian traditions" and suggest that we work
toward intercommunion rather than corporate union, so that the richness
of each of the traditions of faith be preserved.&nbsp; This is hardly a
denial of the truth of the Catholic church.&nbsp;
<p>In fact, Archbishop Bertone, you can set your mind at rest on this issue.&nbsp;
I have said over and over again, both publicly and privately, that I have
a deep sense of belonging to the Catholic church and to its extraordinary
tradition.&nbsp; I have no intention of leaving, for it is here that I
have found God in the Spirit of Christ.&nbsp;
<p>But that does not blind me to the profound Christian truths and tradition
embedded within the other churches.&nbsp; Does your consulter think that
the other communities - the Orthodox, for instance - are deficient and
second class Christians ? Does he suggest that we are the only "true" Christians?&nbsp;
If so, he might have difficulty with the 1993 <b><i>Ecumenical Directory</i></b>
(17) - which I have no doubt your vigilant Congregation would have carefully
scrutinised before publication.&nbsp; The Directory talks about "the rich
diversity of spirituality, discipline, liturgical rites and elaborations
of revealed truth that have grown up among the churches" (my emphasis)
. The phrase that I have emphasised would certainly suggest that a diversity
of theological views is also acceptable within the broad ambit of Catholic
truth.&nbsp;
<p>Here I would like to refer briefly to the least relevant comment that
your consulter makes.&nbsp; He says that I attack "the condemnation of
modernism, failing to understand its true harm".&nbsp; It would seem to
me that assessing "the true harm of modernism" is a matter of historical
judgement and has nothing whatsoever to do with doctrine.&nbsp; As a consequence
it certainly does not come under the aegis of the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith.&nbsp; This statement seems a bit like "point scoring"
to me.&nbsp;
<p>In fact, the reality is that the overwhelming weight of historiographic
opinion today is against your consulter's view.&nbsp; The majority view
is expressed by Professor Roger Aubert, who knows the papacy of Pius X
and this period better than most.&nbsp; Having conceded that the modernists
were far from perfect in attitude (who is?), he says: "One has to admit
that the various measures employed to hold back the tide of modernism must
be assessed negatively.&nbsp; Many men loyal to the church were mercilessly
banned ... But more serious than these personal fates were other facts:
for a long time the undifferentiated suppression of modernism kept the
majority of the clergy from pursuing intellectual investigations .... The
gap between the church and modern culture widened.&nbsp; The solution of
fundamental problems was postponed, and by simply ignoring them nothing
was won, but, on the contrary, harm was done" Roger Aubert in Hubert Jedin
(editor), <b><i>History of the Church.&nbsp; The Church in the Industrial
Age</i></b>, New York: Crossroad, 1981, Vol IX, pp 387-388).&nbsp;
<p>Sometimes one is tempted to think that there are contemporary parallels
to the suppression of modernism.&nbsp; And I think I need to ask your Congregation
if any consideration is being given to the harm done to the reputations
of many loyal and hardworking Catholic lay teachers, theologians, priests
and even bishops by reactionaries who constantly call anyone with whom
they happen to disagree "modernists" ?&nbsp;
<p>The consulter then goes on to say that I hold "an erroneous concept
of infallibility, in as much as [I] only conceive of it in its solemn and
ex cathedra manner, thus excluding the infallibility of the ordinary and
universal magisterium".&nbsp; He quotes four passages from the book which
are apparently meant to demonstrate his contention.&nbsp;
<p>In fact the passages he quotes do not show that I exclude the infallibility
of the ordinary and universal magisterium at all, but they reveal my concern
about the extension at the popular level of the ordinary and universal
magisterium to all and every papal teaching.&nbsp; And please remember
this book was written as popular theology.&nbsp; <b><i>Papal Power</i></b>
nowhere suggests that I have any problem with accepting what is universally
held by the pope and the bishops.&nbsp;
<p>My argument is with the way in which this phrase has subsequently come
to be used as a catch-all term for each and every papal teaching.&nbsp;
The view of the book is that the ordinary and universal magisterium has
been gradually expanded to include the ordinary magisterium of the pope
-and to extend to it a kind of "quasi-infallible" status in popular perception.&nbsp;
<p>I am not alone in this concern about "creeping infallibility".&nbsp;
Father J.M.R. Tillard, OP in his seminal book <b><i>The Bishop of Rome
</i></b>(Wilmington, Del: Michael Glazier, English trans., 1983), after
detailing some examples of ultramontanism which passed in some places as
catechetical instruction up to as late as the 1960s, says: "Another sign
of this inflated ultramontanism, so different from the vastly more prudent
and sober tone of Pastor Aeternus, is a particular conception of the ordinary
magisterium ... This may be seen in the way every judgement which comes
from Rome is implicitly canonised, whether it be dogmatic, theological
or spiritual.&nbsp; Before the influence of Vatican II made itself felt,
the starting point of theological reflection ... was 'the teaching of the
magisterium. The views of anyone not on the same wavelength as 'the centre
of Christianity, were systematically ignored, indeed considered suspect;
theological light could only shine from on high", (pp 32-33).&nbsp; My
contention in <b><i>Papal Power</i></b> is that this false canonisation
of Roman teaching has continued and is still to be found among many people.&nbsp;
<p>In the book I use <b><i>Ordinatio sacerdotalis</i></b> (on the ordination
of women) as an example of ordinary magisterium being 'modulated" into
the ordinary and universal magisterium and thus, by implication, into infallible
teaching.&nbsp; The problem that I make reference to is the question of
how <b><i>Ordinatio sacerdotalis</i></b> can be part of the ordinary and
universal magisterium when there is no apparent evidence that anyone has
asked the bishops their view, and when a sizeable portion of the theological
magisterium is seemingly doubtful about how the question should be resolved
?&nbsp;
<p>Father Francis A. Sullivan, SJ certainly seems to back up my concern
in the quotation I cite on p 19 of <b><i>Papal Power</i></b>.&nbsp; He
says that for something to be taught infallibly by the ordinary magisterium
it has "to be clearly established that the tradition has remained constant,
and that even today the universal body of Catholic bishops is teaching
the same doctrine to be definitively held".&nbsp; It is hard to see how
these conditions could be fulfilled when the question has only been around
for at most two decades.&nbsp;
<p>Moving now to your consulter's comments on my treatment of the doctrine
of reception.&nbsp; He says that I maintain "that in order for a teaching
to become a doctrine of the Church it is first debated by theologians and
decided on by Bishops, but then it must be accepted or received by the
Congregatio fidelium".&nbsp; He does not say what is wrong with that summary
of the notion of reception, although I suspect it is the reference to the
community of the faithful that worries him.&nbsp; Obviously, my text presupposes
that the pope participates in this process as head of the college of bishops.&nbsp;
<p>Actually, I would have thought that your consulter's summary of <b><i>Papal
Power</i></b>'s views is a reasonable, if a somewhat abbreviated and simplified
statement, of the doctrine of reception. my understanding is that the papal
magisterium has a solemn obligation to make sure that what it teaches is
in conformity with what the bishops and community of the church believe.&nbsp;
When this is carefully and fully carried out "The assent of the church
can never be lacking to such definitions on account of the Holy Spirit's
influence" (<b>Lumen gentium</b>, 25).&nbsp; If non-reception occurs those
responsible have a further serious obligation to review their decision
in the light of the belief of the faithful.&nbsp;
<p>A criticism has been made by some theologians that I tend to treat reception
as a post factum reality; that is, a teaching is ultimately confirmed as
true when the Catholic community "receives" it.&nbsp; I would simply argue
in defence of my view that it also seems to be the approach taken by Cardinal
John Henry Newman.&nbsp; Speaking specifically of the definition of infallibility
at Vatican I, Newman said: "If the definition is eventually received by
the whole body of the faithful ... then too it will claim our assent by
the force of the great dictum&nbsp;
<p>‘securus judicat orbis terrarum'".&nbsp; He refers to reception by the
faithful as "the ultimate guarantee of revealed truth" (Both quotations
are taken from <b><i>The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman</i></b>,
edited by Charles Stephen Dessain, Vol XXV, pp 165, 1712).&nbsp;
<p>Your consulter then turns to the issue of conciliarism.&nbsp; I said
in the book that "I lean strongly in [the conciliarist] direction" if that
term is taken strictly to mean that a general council is ultimately superior
to a pope, especially in time of crisis.&nbsp; Contrary to your consulter,
that is the teaching of the Council of Constance.&nbsp; At the third session
on 26 March 1415, led by Cardinal Francesco Zabarella, the Council declared
that it had been constituted in a proper way and at the fifth session on
6 April 1415 the fathers confirmed the decree <b><i>Haec sancta synodus</i></b>
which had already been prepared by Zabarella.&nbsp;
<p>The decree is clear about its purpose: "the eradication of the present
schism" and the "reform of God's church [in] head and members".&nbsp; The
very directness of the language of Haec sancta conveyed the feeling of
the need for action in a time of crisis.&nbsp; The first two points of
Haec sancta were the most important theologically: Firstly, Constance claimed
that it was "legitimately assembled", that it represented the whole church
and it had power "immediately from Christ".&nbsp; Secondly, Haec sancta
stated: Therefore, "everyone of whatever state or dignity, even papal,
is bound to obey it in those matters which pertain to the faith, the eradication
of the said schism and the general reform of the ... church" (The translation
is from Norman P. Tanner's <b><i>Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils</i></b>).&nbsp;
<p>Most historians now accept that Constance was ecumenical from the beginning.&nbsp;
The idea that it only "became ecumenical" from the time the legate of Gregory
XII staged a reading of the bull of convocation is now largely abandoned.&nbsp;
It was not clear who was the pope at the time - there were three candidates
and it is simply an assumption to say that Gregory XII was legitimate pope.&nbsp;
Again, we are engaged here in historical issues and it is for historians
to decide, not theologians.&nbsp;
<p>Finally, your anonymous consulter says that "I appear to reject papal
primacy" - another inference - because of lack of freedom at Vatican I.
Let's get clear what I actually say.&nbsp; I summarise Father Luis Bermejo,
SJ saying: "There are serious doubts about Vatican I's freedom, but he
(Bermejo) emphasises that this is still an open question" (p 115) . "Open"
in English means that the question is still debatable.&nbsp; To say that
debate about a possible lack of freedom is an "open question" is hardly
tantamount to rejection of papal primacy.&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Papal Power</i></b> then goes on to examine the question of the
required moral unanimity at Vatican I. With Bermejo I think that there
are more serious questions to be asked here.&nbsp; I quote Bermejo saying
that the required moral unanimity was not reached (p 116) . I have great
respect for him as a careful historian who has studied the sources thoroughly.&nbsp;
On this issue I neither agree nor disagree with him in my book.&nbsp; And
that is still my position.&nbsp;
<p>Your consulter also says that I say that "the place of the Supreme Pontiff
in relation to other Bishops is <i>primus inter pares</i>" as though this
were an absolute statement on my part.&nbsp; But it is qualified (in block
letters) with the phrase "primacy in the first millennium" (p 161) . The
whole section (pp 161-164) simply talks about the theological views held
in the period prior to Damasus I (366-384) . In this section I am not spelling
out what I think, but what the historical situation was.&nbsp; Either the
consulter has not read the section, or he misrepresents my position totally.&nbsp;
Either way, it is an utterly incorrect assumption to infer - again it is
an inference -&nbsp; that this brief saying sums up my view of papal primacy.&nbsp;
<p>He then goes on to say that I "reject the <i>plenitudo potestatis</i>
of the Roman Pontiff claiming it is a juridical term that has its roots
in the Bull <b><i>Unam Sanctam</i></b> and not in divine revelation".&nbsp;
<p>I have one simple question: where in divine revelation can one find
the term<i> plenitudo potestatis</i>?&nbsp; The historical facts are that
the term comes from Roman law.&nbsp; It entered the canonical tradition
just before the time of Innocent III.&nbsp; In this period fullness of
authority became synonymous in canonical thought with papal primacy.&nbsp;
As John A. Watt has pointed out two historical sources come together to
inject meaning into the term <i>plenitudo potestatis</i>.&nbsp; The canonists
linked the authority granted to Peter in the Petrine text with the notion
of imperial or monarchical power which had came into canon law from Roman
law.&nbsp; Increasingly, in practice, the popes imitated imperial power.&nbsp;
By the time of Innocent III the term <i>plenitudo potestatis</i> denoted
papal sovereignty.&nbsp; This sovereignty became co-terminus with primacy.&nbsp;
<p>Again here we are dealing with historical facts.&nbsp; To infer from
this historical discussion that I reject papal primacy is totally incorrect.&nbsp;
<p>In conclusion, Archbishop, I have to say that in general I found your
consulter's <b><i>Observations</i></b> quite extraordinary.&nbsp; With
the exception of the issue of the ordinary and universal magisterium, the
criticisms are nothing more than inferences drawn from quotations taken
out of context from my book.&nbsp;
<p>Ultimately, the Catholic church and the people of God will be the judge
of us all,&nbsp;
<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
