 Father Paul Collins has resigned from the priesthood, and he speaks about his recent decisive brush with Vatican heresy-hunters. Also: the influence of B.A. Santamaria in Australian political life still resonates today - but what were the real objectives of this controversial Catholic activist? We talk to Bruce Duncan, author of the recent book "Crusade or Conspiracy", about Bob Santamaria, the Labor Party and the Church.

 <b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Hello, and welcome to the program. This week, we're taking fresh look at the controversial career of <a href="s259574.htm#anchor1" title="Go to story">B.A. Santamaria</a> - but first: a thorn in the flesh of Papal loyalists.<BR><BR>‘Who shall rid me of this troublesome priest?’ Well, that well-known controversialist, Father Paul Collins, has resigned, saying he can no longer in conscience subscribe to the policies and theological emphases coming from the Vatican.<BR><BR>Father Collins received a ‘please explain’ letter from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, or CDF, back in 1997, after publication of his book, ‘Papal Power’. But he’s refused to co-operate with that inquiry or to submit a clarification of his views. The CDF is the Vatican department descended from the Inquisition. It chases heresy and it’s chaired by the very feline Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.<BR><BR>So why has Paul Collins resigned now? And what has he resigned from? From his order, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart? From the priesthood, or from the church? Certainly not from book publishing. In fact Paul Collins has a new book coming out, about – you guessed it – well-known Catholic intellectuals who’ve fallen foul of the CDF.<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>On the 14th December last year, the Superior General of my religious order, Father Michael Curran, was summonsed into the palazzo of the Holy Office by Archbishop Tarsisio Bertoni, and he was hauled over the coals basically and asked pretty much why he hadn’t pulled me into line, and when was I going to answer their letters and so on and so forth. Curran gave them an article that I had written in a small theological magazine here in Australia called <I>Compass</I>, which addressed the three issues that they were putting to me. The first of those was the primacy of the Pope, the Pope’s headship of the church; the second, the question of ecumenism, relationships with the other churches; and the third was the ordination of women. They then took that article and said, ‘Well we’re going to examine this now.’ Then Curran thought that he’d kind of smoothed things over. <BR><BR>Two days later he received a letter signed by Cardinal Ratzinger himself, in which Ratzinger makes it quite clear that they are not going to put up with my criticism, my public criticism of them. And at that stage I realised that with this new book coming out ‘From Inquisition to Freedom’, it was going to be on for young and old. It created for me a real problem in conscience. Could I have Father Curran and the local Australian provincial Father Bob Irwin, and the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in Australia, my religious order, caught in this crossfire between myself and the CDF. And so it seemed to me that resignation was the only option.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>What is it actually that you’re resigning from? Are you leaving the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, are you leaving the priesthood, or are you leaving the church?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Well I’m leaving the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. By leaving the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, I’m leaving the priesthood effectively because unless a Bishop were to take me in his diocese, I’m not tied to any place and you can’t operate as a freelance priest. So, since no Bishop in his right mind in Australia would be inviting me to join him, I think you can safely say that I’m leaving the priesthood. I’m certainly not leaving the Catholic church, I’m a convinced, dedicated and committed Catholic and I absolutely intend to stay here till death do us part.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>The truth is, though, haven’t you lived pretty much independently of your order for years and years?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Yes, that’s the truth actually. I’m glad you’ve said it, because I have to explain this to people. People say this must be a big tragedy, leaving the priesthood, and how will you feel about not saying mass, and preaching and so on and so forth. Well, the reality is that I was in the ABC effectively from 1986 to 1996, then I’ve been a freelance writer and broadcaster since 1996 till the present day. And nowadays I do a bit of freelance work for ABC Television.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Some people might say that effectively you’ve been living the life of a priest without superior.<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>That’s right, yes. Well that’s a fair comment. I don’t resile from that as a comment and I think it’s probably got a considerable grain of truth in it. But the reality is that priests do all types of things. I mean the most famous priest perhaps of the 20th century is Pere Teilhard de Chardin, and he was a palaeontologist and scientist. I mean priests teach school, priests do all types of things. It really seems to me that the priesthood and the ministry, you see I think of it much more in terms of ministry than priesthood, and what I’ve tried to do over the years is simply to say that talking about religion must go on in society, talking about ethics, talking about spirituality, that all has to go on in society along with talking about politics and economics and everything else. <BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>I must confess that I’ve never really understood what this inquiry was about, in the sense that you’re an historian, not a theologian and that you’re not someone who’s doing cutting-edge work in theology, you’re essentially a populariser.<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>That’s absolutely correct. Thank you for summing me up perfectly, Stephen.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Was it any more in the beginning, than a fairly standard <I>pro forma</I> kind of inquiry?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>No, it was more than that. My guess about where it originated, it was about going back to the very thing that you said, bringing a bigmouth that was seemingly out of control – a loose cannon that had access to the media in Australia reasonably well – bringing that person into line. And it’s fair enough for those in authority who disagree with me to want to do that. I don’t have any problem with that. And the book was used as a way of doing that, but it also fitted the Vatican’s agenda, because it’s quite clear that the CDF at that stage, in 1997 and continuing now, are very interested in pulling people into line who represent the church very, very publicly, if you like, Lavinia Byrne, a nun in the UK who was in some ways my equivalent, she does a lot of work for the BBC, that it’s quite clear they’re trying to pull people like us into line.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Given that you’ve been rather independent in your life in connection with your own order, will there be people who’ll be saying that this is no mere coincidence, it’s actually a charade; this guy’s got a book coming out, and he’s doing it for the publicity.<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Yes well that’s been put to me already several times. The answer to that is yes and no, to be absolutely honest. As I said at the beginning, Father Curran was summonsed in on the 16th December; I found out about this on 20th January. There’s been considerable debate between myself, the local Australian provincial Bob Irwin and the general of the order. That’s gone on throughout much of February. So it’s merely incidental from that point of view. However, being a strategist and knowing a little bit about marketing, of course I’m going to place that right next to the publication of the book, to be absolutely honest. Of course that’s true.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>On the other hand, in terms of your own sort of longer-term career, is there a danger that without having that ‘Father’ in front of the Paul Collins, that you could in a sense sink like a stone, that it’s actually that ambivalence and ambiguity of your position which actually makes you such an interesting character in the media in Australia?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Well time will tell with regard to that. I think that’s an absolutely pertinent comment, and I can’t answer it. In some ways it will be dependent on your good self and various others in the media to continue to bring me in to comment. My hope and my guess is that it won’t change very much, specifically for the reasons that you outlined, and that is there’s always been a certain ambivalence about whether he was or whether he wasn’t a priest, and what his exact status was. And I suppose I’m also, to be quite honest about it, able to continue to place myself in that slightly ambivalent position in order to maintain that kind of interest. But the truth will out as time goes on.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Is that kind of ambivalence, just to talk about you personally, something that you personally thrive on, that you need?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Yes, I think that’s probably true. I think inside I have a very firm commitment to Catholicism, I’m very much a Catholic, I belong squarely I think within the middle of the Catholic tradition, I’m not radical, I’m actually quite moderate to conservative if anything. I have a very firm kind of sense of self, if you like, but at the same time I know that ambivalence is interesting in media.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Will you continue to say mass in private for Catholics of like mind?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Well that will depend a little on what the community wants. I’m not ruling that out absolutely, but at the same time I think that a person like myself has to be very careful not to divide the community, or not to kind of form some – I mean I’ve criticised sectarian attitudes in the broader church, I certainly have to make sure that I don’t create a sect of my own. So I would have all those caveats against that, but at the same time I don’t rule anything out.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>So the Father Paul Collins may not disappear entirely?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Well time will tell, and in my more pious moments I’d certainly say it’s a matter of whatever God’s will is.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Right. If God forbid, I ever find a girl I want to marry and I call you up, are you available or not available?<BR><BR><b>Paul Collins: </b>Marriage is a difficult one. Well in fact I’m easily protected there, to save you from my ministrations as a marriage celebrant. I’m only State-registered by being a Catholic priest, so that once my name is off that register, it’s off the State register as well. So unless I went to become a secular celebrant, which I have absolutely no intention of doing, you’ll be saved from my ministry Stephen.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>The ambivalent Father Paul Collins, or ‘Mister’ Paul Collins.<BR><a name="anchor1"></a><BR><b>Voice of Bob Santamaria: </b>If my name had been Smith rather than Santamaria, I don’t think that Doctor Evatt’s attack would have been mounted in that way at all. But the name Santamaria in an Anglo Saxon civilisation is full of unutterable possibilities. It connotes Italian, Southern European, Catholic, Machiavellianism, all of those things can be built up around that name. You wouldn’t remember the actual terms of the conflict in the ‘50s, that it would be different to associate phrases like this: ‘Santamaria’s cloak and stiletto tactics’ with the name Smith. The phrase ‘cloak and stiletto’ which was used again and again at the time, goes wonderfully with a name like Santamaria.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Well B.A. Santamaria may have denied being a cloak and stiletto Machiavellian; he also denied that his National Civic Council ever attempted to infiltrate and take over the Australian Labor Party.<BR><BR>But that’s not the picture painted in an important new work of Australian history.<BR><BR>Catholic historian and priest, Bruce Duncan, has just published ‘Crusade or Conspiracy?’ about Catholics and their role in the split in the Labor Party in the mid-1950s, and it’s been based on unprecedented access to archives in Rome and Australia.<BR><BR>What emerges is a fascinating mosaic of the mad, mad world of the Australian Catholic church, of Melbourne’s Archbishop Daniel Mannix still clinging stubbornly to power at the age of 99, and of the glorious Eucharistic Congress in Sydney in 1953, like something out of a Fellini movie.<BR><BR>And at the centre of the whole crazy web, B.A. Santamaria.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>There is no denying the impact of the split in the Labor Party on the trajectory of Australia’s social and political life from the ‘50s on. In the Labor Party itself, the shadow of the split is perhaps greyer now than it once was, but in the Catholic Church it is still clearly defined. Any Australian Catholic Church entry into public discussion, any kind of policy decision still has to take into account the legacy of what was once called the Movement.<BR><BR>So what Bruce Duncan has discovered about the split and about Bob Santamaria and his activities during the ‘40s and ‘50s is important not only historically, but now, as Catholics contemplate the relationship between religious belief and political action.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>The main aim was to try to clarify what went on in the split. I think a lot of other people in the same position, they were aware that there was a huge fight going on within the church, but they didn’t know what exactly was being debated, why the Catholic community became so polarised, and why the Vatican intervened and what was the final outcome.<BR><BR>Secondly I think the dispute over the split was never resolved, it was left up in the air because of the secrecy that governed the whole dispute, and this has continued on; the influence of the Santamaria movement continued on. Still a lot of people are caught in those primal loyalties.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>And indeed in Melbourne where we’re sitting now, the influence of the Santamaria movement as you call it, is still very much felt within Catholic life.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes, not so much as it has been, but even since the split there are still disputes within the Catholic community which revolve around the movement, like Catholic involvement in the Vietnam War for instance, very much driven by Bob Santamaria and the movement; the disputes over internal church discipline and the direction of change in the church which became an increasing preoccupation for Bob Santamaria. These are still with us. So these are major issues in the last 40 years that have come out of the movement experience and been directed by the movement in many cases which have had a lasting impact. So I wanted to understand where all this was coming from. Why this passion about Communism, why was it directed in certain directions and not in others?<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Bruce Duncan. <BR><BR>To understand the why, he says, you have to go back to the 1930s debate in Europe about the proper role of the church in a secular democracy. On one side stood the political integralists, those who identified the church with certain invariably right-wing political positions. On the other was the circle around French philosopher Jacques Maritain, the man who was later chosen by Pope Paul VI to represent the world of intellectuals at the closing address of the Second Vatican Council. Maritain was at the helm of a redevelopment of Catholic political philosophy in support of democracy and human rights. The 1930s debate came to a head with the crisis in Spain and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>For Bob Santamaria, Communism was totally evil, and this contrasted with Maritain who had been giving lectures in Spain before the Spanish Civil War, and who had been urging the church there to educate itself in its own social teaching and to combat the injustices which he saw in Spain. And he said of Communism that there were many elements in Communism which the church should have been saying, it shouldn’t have been leaving it to the Communists to say, the church should have been taking the lead on these issues. And he said at one time that the landscape was scattered with the debris of Christianity which the Communists picked up and ran with. So in effect Communism was a critique of the failure of Christianity in Spain to bring about social justice.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Attitudes to Communism weren’t the only point of difference. In Bruce Duncan’s account the Italian factor emerges as an important influence. Santamaria was the child of Italian immigrants and in one sense, Santamaria the Catholic activist is the product of between-the-wars Anglo prejudices.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>He deeply resented the anti-Italian attitudes in Australia in the ‘30s and ‘40s. <BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>As Mussolini was rising?<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes. He deeply resented that. Because he saw Italians as having a great culture and tradition and he wanted to recover that, and his thesis when he was a student, his MA thesis, was really looking at the rise of Mussolini. He has an admiration for authority, the strong man, Mussolini coming in to restore order. So he says there is something sacred about the notion of authority in the old classical tradition of an autocracy or a monarchy, but a strong man, a one ruler, stepping in to restore the country from a decadent democracy.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>And it’s at this early stage that you have this notion of Catholic action developing and this little group forming around the possibility of so-called Catholic Action. Perhaps you could explain to us what this phrase means?<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes, it’s a phrase which developed gradually. It originally meant just Catholic organisations. Gradually during the 1920s it took on a more precise form which was a tightly bound network of organisations made more concentrated by the Pope at the time, Pius XI as a way to defend the church from the Fascists in Italy. But overseas it was meant to be an educational organisation, a formative organisation. And it was very strict that it had no political role. So when Bob Santamaria asked for the approval of the Bishops in 1945 they declined to recognise it as Catholic Action.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Approval for his group?<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>His movement, industrial movement. But the interesting point is that he asked the Bishops to define it as Catholic Action and the outcome of it was, the cause of all our problems, was that they defined it as not as Catholic Action proper but as an official organisation of the church engaged in the struggle against Communism, whatever that might mean. So it was neither fish now fowl, it was neither Catholic Action nor the action of Catholics, which was what Maritain was always arguing for, that Catholics in politics should act on their own initiative, not as agents of the church. <BR><BR>So the role of the church was to form Catholics in religious and value formation and then to educate them in the church’s social teaching. At that point the church would disengage and Catholics were on their own, and they could organise and do whatever they liked, but on their own responsibility. Now Bob Santamaria came along and he said, ‘Look, that’s not going to work; we need to keep Catholics together in organisation, under command structure authorised by the Bishops’ and Catholics were required to do this out of loyalty to the church. So it became inserted into the political structure of Australia.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Why were the Bishops so unclear about it, because surely they knew the difference, many of them did know the difference between Catholic Action and action of Catholics?<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes. But they were in a state of panic because in 1945 the Communists gained a significant influence in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and they were afraid that the Communists were about to launch a coup. It’s most astonishing to read the Catholic papers at this time, or listen to the speeches, the tremendous fear of Communism that was there. And the fear that the Communists were about, within a matter of years, were about to launch the same sort of anti-Catholic atrocities as had happened in Spain.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Well, the Catholic Bishops had fudged to accommodate Santamaria. They’d stopped short of ordaining the movement as the church’s official political arm, but they had allowed it a level of official status. But the chickens came home to root, and within ten years the Bishops began to change their minds. Bruce Duncan.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>The Sydney Bishops changed their mind when they realised that Bob had expanded the aims of the movement beyond an industrial struggle against the Communists and the unions, to take over the Labor Party.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>So you are emphatic about this: his aim wasn’t simply an anti-Communist struggle, it was something else.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>No, he saw the anti-Communist struggle as the first stage of it. His attempt to implement his Christian social vision that he saw for Australia.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>You quoted a secret recording I think: Santamaria said that the fight against Communism is simply a side issue. He wants the movement tactfully to take key positions under Labor leaders.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>This is a difficult matter because he later denied repeatedly that the movement intended to take over the Labor Party, but there’s quite a deal of documentation. What he was aiming for was to exercise a dominant influence in the Labor Party to shape it according to the policies he wanted. The Sydney Bishops regarded this as an attempt to take over the Labor Party; Dr Paddy Ryan, who was a leader of the movement in Sydney, MSC priest, strongly reacted against Santamaria’s attempt to expand the movement into these new political areas, and he advised Cardinal Gilroy and Bishop Carroll that this was going too far. This precipitated a split within the movement itself even before Evatt’s denunciation. In fact we can see in some of the documents, the influence of some of the Sydney priests, particularly Monsignor Wallace, in urging the Labor Party people to come out and denounce the movement.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>The whole thing is such a sorry story in so many ways, and I found it fascinating in your book that so few people emerge with intact reputations. In a strange way, somebody like Archbishop James Carroll emerges better than some historians of Catholic Australia have painted him in recent decades, as a sort of apparatchik of the ALP; he does emerge as having some sort of principled reaction to Santamaria’s position. Well he’s one of the very few, in fact even some of those said historians don’t emerge very well, your book is a big question mark about the interpretation, for example, of Patrick O’Farrell of Australian Catholic life in the ‘40s and ‘50s.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes I think part of the problem here has been that I’m the first one to have access to the documents, so it’s been difficult for historians to work out precisely what did happen and whose version among the competing voices one listened to. So, you’re right, I think the Sydney people do emerge much more creditably and particularly Bishop Carroll.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>And as for other reputations you really put the kybosh on Archbishop Mannix, following upon the Australian Dictionary of Biography entry on Archbishop Mannix; well you’ve added a great deal of evidence to support that particular view of him.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes, I think people will be surprised at what they find there. Also surprised that Mannix had so little time for church theory, formal church theory; he’s not guided by any theory at all.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Or theology in fact.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Or theology in this, exactly. And he and Bob Santamaria completely ignore the line that is coming through from Rome that had been coming through very strongly since 1951, articulating the distinction between action of Catholics, acting independently, and Catholic Action. And this line is repeatedly articulated by the Roman authorities and studiously ignored by Bob Santamaria and by Mannix.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>We’ve talked around and about the person of Bob Santamaria. As I said before, you don’t attempt to psychoanalyse him, but a really, well a many-faceted picture of him emerges from your book and you see from fairly early in his career certain patterns which became so characteristic. And I wrote down a number of them: his capacity to re-represent, I might say, people accuse him of misrepresenting them, but he certainly re-represented them constantly for his own purpose, right through his life. He identified enemies terribly readily. Very early on he was talking about the usual organised alliance between journalists, universities and seminaries, this is in the ‘40s which struck me as extraordinary, a very young man writing that. The ascribing to personal motives of particular actions and standpoints and particular criticisms. His unwillingness to share platforms because he felt he was the only one who could say anything. All these sorts of aspects to his personality and development emerge in your book. Now you don’t go so far as to interpret these, but I’m reading it, and the word that comes to mind is megalomania. What do you say to that?<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes it’s very difficult to interpret, and I’m glad you mentioned that I didn’t offer a psychological explanation, it’s not my expertise and I wouldn’t dare do it. But all these aspects are very curious. He begins out with a very conspiratorial view of the world; the first issue of The Catholic Worker he talks of it as being a Catholic Communist, or himself being a Catholic Communist, a most astonishing statement for him to make. And then the next issue that the so-called opposition between capitalism and communism is so much eyewash, they’re both sisters under the skin, he said they are in a conspiracy together against the church. And I think this remains his basic framework as of having a mission to defend the church, and trying to respond to the enemies he sees attacking the church in both capitalism and communism.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>But he’s the only one who can see the mission ultimately, nobody else is adequately to it.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes, he’s certainly very convinced of his position. And he is certainly the pre-eminent, he has such extraordinary charisma, extraordinary authority is given him partly through the patronage of Mannix.<BR><BR><b>Margaret Coffey: </b>Archbishop Carroll referred to it as a form of hypnosis.<BR><BR><b>Bruce Duncan: </b>Yes. But he had a tremendous power of rhetoric and drama, but when you look at the rhetoric closely you find it is primarily the rhetoric of a debater, not the rhetoric of a thinker. And a debater shapes facts to fit his argument. The perception of Bob Santamaria that he is a great intellect is mistaken. I think he is a great propagandist in the old sense of the word, a great populariser of his ideas, a great spin doctor we would call it. And he uses whatever is at hand, whether it’s church documents or whatever. You’ve noticed this. Sometimes he will interpret church documents almost in the exact opposite sense to which they were intended, to support his argument. But is it out of a sense of malicious, Machiavellian intent? I don’t know. I think it’s more that he is such an extreme voluntarist. I remember Henry Mayer pointing this out that Santamaria reminded him most of Lenin and of course he admired Lenin, Santamaria built the movement on the model of a Leninist party, with power centralised in the top man, himself. So this sense of extreme voluntarism where he believed that will, the power of will, could overcome all obstacles. So that if he willed this hard enough, he could achieve the objective of a reformed agrarian-based civilisation in Australia as he dreamed or imagined the Catholic ideal in Italy had been. He becomes a victim of this stress on will, because he actually believes it himself. <BR><BR>I don’t think he went out of his way to mislead and misinterpret events, I think he was just so convinced of his ideas that he automatically kept reinterpreting things to mean the exact opposite of what they had originally intended to mean. So that unblushingly he could declare that the goals of the movement had not been out to take control of the Labor Party, I think he kept re-writing things in his own mind.<BR><BR><b>Stephen Crittenden: </b>Historian and priest, Bruce Duncan with Margaret Coffey.
