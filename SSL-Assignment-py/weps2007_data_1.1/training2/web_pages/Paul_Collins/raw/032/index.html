The Strange Afterlife and Times of Thomas Paine</i>, a travelogue 
following the missing body of America's founding father, whose bones 
were stolen by an admirer in 1819 and have been turning up in odd 
places ever since—including inside a statue, amid savage dogs and 
crazed monkeys, and under a London tailor's stool.
