They suggest that the "fall of communism" was one of the greatest deceptions of the last century. All of the Russian "liberalization" initiatives seem to have been mere cosmetic alterations with no sincerity behind them at all. This move has been quite effective. It has caused the Western elite (which are just as criminal and conspiratorial as the Russian elite) to believe that Russia had ceased to be a major competitor in the crusade to establish a New World Order.</p><div class="cRight">Paul and Phillip Collins | <span class="dd">2006-11-18</span></div><h3><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/Commentary/MJ-12_Technocratic.htm" title="MJ-12: The Technocratic Thread">MJ-12: The Technocratic Thread</a></h3><p><a class="cLeft" href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/Commentary/MJ-12_Technocratic.htm"><img title="" src="ufoCultSmall.jpg" width="41" height="41" alt="" border="0" /></a>Preoccupied with aliens and flying saucers, Ufologists overlook the technocratic implications of the MJ-12 documents.

Norquist is a GOP/Bush operative who helped the President gain the support of Islamic people and organizations here in the United States. The Nation magazine referred to Norquist as "'Field Marshal of the Bush Plan" (Gitell, no pagination). However, Norquist can be characterized as much more than just a Bush supporter. Grover Norquist is best described as the tie between the Administration and Islamists.</p><div class="cRight">Phillip D.

The first spouse is the Cult of Intelligence, which is the CIA. Despite its fierce secrecy, many, if not all Americans, are aware of this Cult's existence.

Point the accusatory finger at the neoconservatives and their concept of a global democratic revolution. The neoconservatives are a faction of the elite that are essentially running the Bush Administration.

Characterizing <cite>Walden Two</cite> as an innocuous fiction, Skinner stated: "The 'behavioral engineering' I had so frequently mentioned in the book was, at the time, little more than science fiction" (vi).

            constitutes the nucleus of the ruling class religion. While there
            are definitely political and economic rationales for elite
            criminality, Luciferianism can account for the longevity of many of
            the oligarchs' projects. Many of the longest and most brutal human
            endeavors have been underpinned by some form of religious zealotry.
            The Crusades testify to this historical fact. Likewise, the power
            elite's ongoing campaign to establish a socialist totalitarian
            global government has Luciferianism to thank for both its longevity
            and frequently violent character. In the mind of the modern
            oligarch, Luciferianism provides religious legitimacy for otherwise
            morally questionable plans.</p><div class="cRight">Phillip D.

It originated with the occult pantheism of the ancient Mystery Religions and was scientifically dignified by racialist ideologue Charles Darwin. While this supremacy doctrine was initially racialist in character, it has expanded its bestial view of man to encompass all those outside the power elite's insular clique.</p><div class="cRight">Phillip D.

This occult belief originated in Mesopotamia roughly 6000 years ago and was actively promulgated by the various Mystery cults. It also comprises the ruling class religion of today. At the heart of the doctrine is the claim that man is gradually evolving towards apotheosis. Throughout the years, the religion of apotheosized man has recycled itself under numerous appellations. Darwinism was but one more installment in this seamless ideational continuum. In this series, I am going to examine one of the chief facilitators of man's purported evolution: war.</p><div class="cRight">Phillip D.

The instructor, who happens to be an extremely intelligent woman, was going to examine Foucault. I was eager to study Foucault and seized the opportunity. His Marxist proclivities aside, Foucault's views concerning the carceral system were certainly of merit and valuable to my research. Yet, there was another philosopher on the menu. In the halls of orthodox academia, his reputation precedes him. His name is Friedrich Nietzsche.</p><div class="cRight">Phillip D.

This authoritarian mentality becomes all the more evident when Skinner states: "... Russia after fifty years is not a model we wish to emulate. China may be closer to the solutions I have been talking about, but a Communist revolution in America is hard to imagine" (<cite>Walden Two</cite> xv). In other words, the communism of mass murdering Red China is preferable to the Russian variety of communism. Why? The Russian communists did not go far enough.</p><div class="cRight">Paul and Phillip Collins | <span class="dd">2005-05-27</span></div><h3><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/Commentary/DSM_Reconsidered.htm" title="The New Malleus Maleficarum: The DSM Reconsidered">The New Malleus Maleficarum: The DSM Reconsidered</a></h3><p><a class="cLeft" href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/Commentary/DSM_Reconsidered.htm"><img title="" src="chaoSmall.jpg" width="41" height="41" alt="" border="0" /></a>[...] the DSM can be seen as merely the modern incarnation of <cite>The Malleus Maleficarum</cite>.

The history and background of this "scientific dictatorship" is a conspiracy, created and micro-managed through the historical tide of Darwinism, which has its foundations in Freemasonry.

Evidently, Brown recognized the potential of semiotics in analyzing the coded messages of cabals occupying history&rsquo;s darker corners. September 11th is one such corner that is worth semiotic analysis.</p>          <hr />

            "The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship", we examined the
            transmogrification of the elite's religious power structure into a
            technocratic oligarchy legitimized predominantly by science. The
            history and background of this "scientific dictatorship" is a
            conspiracy, created and micro-managed by the historical tide of
            Darwinism, which has its foundations in Freemasonry. In this
            article, we shall examine the "scientific dictatorship" as an
            enormous project in the re-sculpting of reality itself.

According to this hopelessly flawed view, the problems of injustice and inequity that destabilize societal order are remedied when opposing factions of the ruling class arrive at an agreement. Hypothetically, this coalitional realignment within the elite will deter further deviation from democratic norms. In harmonious consensus, the elite paternally guide the ignorant sheep of the lower classes into the future.

The NWO has taken the field by storm, and is proceeding with coordinated attacks on several fronts, using all the latest high-tech vocabulary ammunition. They've laid a bed of land mines that cripple us when we try to stand on them: 'liberalism', conservatism', prosperity', 'democracy'."<br /><strong>Richard Moore, Doublespeak</strong></p><p>"The true equation is 'democracy' = government by world financiers...The main mark of modern governments is that we do not know who governs, de facto any more than de jure. We see the politician and not his backer; still less the backer of the backer; or what is most important of all, the banker of the backer. Enthroned above all, in a manner without parallel in all past, is the veiled prophet of finance, swaying all men living by a sort of magic, and delivering oracles in a language not understanded [sic] of the people."<br /><strong>J.R.R.
