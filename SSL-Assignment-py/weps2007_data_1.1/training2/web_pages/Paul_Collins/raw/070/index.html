      <span class="booktitle">Paul Collins</span> 
      <p><img src="paul_collins.jpg" width="151" height="200" align="right">I 
        was born in Melbourne in 1940. As a child I really wanted to be an actor 
        or an orchestral conductor, but chose the Catholic priesthood instead. 
        Some have argued that in my case there is not much difference!</p>
      <p> I was ordained in 1967 and then worked as a priest and secondary school 
        teacher in Toowoomba. From there I went to Hobart, where I worked in a 
        parish; Sydney, where I taught students for the priesthood; Papua New 
        Guinea where I taught in a university teaching; and Michigan, USA where 
        I taught theology. </p>
      <p>My first book, Mixed Blessings - which looks at what had happened in 
        the Catholic church since the end of the Second Vatican Council in 1965 
        - was published in 1986. I then went on to join the ABC as a broadcaster 
        and commentator on religious affairs. I worked in radio and TV, eventually 
        ending up as Specialist Editor &#150; Religion. I left the ABC in 1996, 
        but still appear on the national broadcast as a commentator on religious 
        affairs &#150; and a sometime protagonist on Catholic affairs! </p>
      <p>As well as <i>Mixed Blessings</i>, I have written <i>No Set Agenda </i>(1992), 
        a book about Australian Catholicism; <i>God's Earth: Religion as if Matter 
        Really Mattered </i>(1995), which is a radical book about religion and 
        ecology (and my personal favourite!); and <i>Papal Power </i>(1997), a 
        study of the papal office and ideas about how it might develop in the 
        future. <i>Papal Power </i>touched a raw nerve in Rome and is being 'examined' 
        by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith &#150; aka the Roman 
        Inquisition. Vatican interest has helped sales of the book enormously! 
      </p>
      <p>I live in Canberra (well, Queanbeyan to be specific) and work as a kind 
        of free-lance priest-writer-broadcaster, with regular contributions in 
        many newpapers, including <i>The Australian</i>, the <i>Sydney Morning 
        Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>. I also do regular spots on ABC metro stations 
        across Australia and often appear on ABC TV &#150; I even make it onto 
        the commercial stations occasionally!</p>
      <p> I have a Masters degree in theology from Harvard University and a Doctorate 
        in history from the Australian National University. I am still working 
        on papal history, I'm thinking about a new book on God and ecology and 
        have half-written a novel. However, it is helping in out in parishes on 
        weekends that keeps me in touch with everyday reality.</p>
