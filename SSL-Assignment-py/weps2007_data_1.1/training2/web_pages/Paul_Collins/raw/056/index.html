<h2>Paul Collins - Artist Management, Booking and Music Publishing
</h2>
<p>Paul Collins Artist Management International is based in Kansas City, Missouri. With over 25 years of experience in administration and management, Mr. Collins has held responsible leadership positions in government, corporate, private business and the community. Mr. Collins developed the love of music from his father, who was a classically trained pianist, lover of jazz and music educator. Coming from a musical family, his father earned a bachelors and masters degree in music. He also performed with musical groups in Richmond, Virginia before the family relocated in 1963 to Kansas City, Missouri, a mecca for jazz. There are fond memories of his father practicing or teaching music everyday, since there was a studio with an upright grand piano in the home. Every Sunday, Paul would make sure his chores kept him close to home, just to enjoy listening to his father play the piano or listening to his fathers' record collection of 78's, 33 1/3 or 45's on the family turntable. "Before my father passed away", Paul recalls, "I would watch him play and teach music lessons on instruments such as the piano, guitar, clarinet, organ, flute and violin. I would hear him comment about how he was taught to site read and play some of the most challenging compositions by classical composers such as Bach, Mozart, Chopin and Beethoven. I personally have not taken the time to play a musical instrument, but if I did, that standard of achievement would stick in my mind." Over ten years ago when a friend of the family found out about his passion for music and gift for organization, she immediately put those skills to work in logistics at outdoor festivals and indoor concerts in the Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District. This quickly progressed to stage hand, assistant sound tech, stage manager, house manager at the Historic Gem Theater, special events manager and eventually manager of the American Jazz Museum's Blue Room. These strategic assignments coupled with a passion for music was a great fit. It also put him in a leadership position in the community to champion local jazz and in close contact with musicians and jazz legends from around the world. Mr. Collins made artist management his chief aim in life several years ago after being dormant as a productive force in music. Rejuvenating the the love of music his father had instilled in him at an early age was friend, mentor and world-re-nowned jazz saxophonist, Bobby Watson. "When Bobby returned to Kansas City, it was great! The community really surrounded him and embraced the efforts of those that had also done great things at the university in the name of jazz. That was a wake-up call to me. I had forgot how much "live" music brought joy and a quality to my life that I wanted back."  Mr. Watson is the former musical director of the Art Blakley Band and professor of jazz studies at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory of Music. After talking to Mr. Watson about his passion and goals in the music business, he suggested contacting his friend Dr. Darryl White, associate professor of trumpet studies at the University of Nebraska Conservatory of Music. Dr. White was looking to grow his music in key markets around the country. In addition to working with Dr. White, Mr. Collins has the privilege of working with other virtuosos in the classical and jazz genres from around the world. With his sights set as high as the notes on the treble clef but feet firmly on the notes of the bass clef, Mr. Collins continues to approach his work in music with the same discipline and passion as he did when he first started over eight years ago. " I see my work as structured  yet just as  improvsational as the recording of "Kinda Blue" by Miles Davis or like sight reading a piece of sheet music or lead sheet. Claude Monet, one of my favorite impressionist, used canvas to paint what he saw with his eyes. I paint, write or play what I want and see in my mind."  As a result he has created a musical portrait of the way he sees his life in music. He has served as inspiration for musicians and as framer for the future of music business. He has a world of friends, family and music aficionados to thank for that.   <br />
<br />
"Many thanks to "Jazz Friends" at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory of Music and Dance and the long time jazz support leaders, "The Jazz Ambassadors." These model membership groups with their executive committees, help support jazz, students, faculty and educational programs that feature jazz in Kansas City with a stage to the world."

<h2>Gumbi Ortiz, composer, percussionist
</h2>
<p>Puerto Rico is known for its lush vegetation, coffee beans, baseball legends, tropical atmosphere and music. From such a rich culture it is no wonder Gumbi Ortiz is so productive in the music industry. Coming from a musical family, Gumbi‚Äôs father played the saxophone. Gumbi started playing this instrument at an early age before the deep seated rhythms of percussion started growing in him like tobacco, coffee beans and bananas trees in Cuba and Puerto Rico. Responding to these deep seated Latin, Cuban, Caribbean and African rhythmic influences Gumbi Ortiz has created his own recognizable sound. Not only is Gumbi a study in his heritage but he has also practiced and prepared himself for greater musical experience. This opportunity came when international guitar virtuoso Al Di Meola saw Ortiz jamming at a club in St. Petersburg, Florida back in 1986. Little did he know within days he would be jamming with Di Meola at an outdoor park in St. Petersburg before a crowd of 40,000 fans. From that day forward the two have traveled the world together for over 19 years. Now with all of this rich heritage and experience behind him and in him comes the debut CD project entitled ‚ÄúMiami‚Äù. At the forefront of this project is an All Star team which includes Executive Producer Kermit Weeks, producer Dan O‚ÄôBrien and Roger Nichols, senior engineer (7 time Grammy Award Winning engineer who is best known for his 30 years of work with Steely Dan). The musicians joining Gumbi on ‚ÄúMiami‚Äù is like a who‚Äôs, who list of smooth jazz greats such as Jeff Lorber, Brandon Fields, Barry Miles, Dave Weckl, Jay Beckenstein, Al Di Meola, Mario Rodriguez, Joel Rosenblatt, Scott Ambush, Eric Marienthal and  Rachel Z just to mention a few.   This new CD embodies all of the elements that have influences Ortiz from the beginning while listening to Carlos Santana and incorporating the possibilities of blending Latin and pop music to performing with his friend drummer and timbale player Chuckie Lopez. With his friend Chuckie they began playing with some big R&B acts which include the Salsoul Orchestra and the dual hit music titans, Ashford & Simpson. Ortiz later performed with many of the great Latin bands in and around New York City from Tito Puente to Charlie Palmieri.  Moving to Florida to be with his family who had emigrated from Cuba during the 1980‚Äôs, Ortiz settled there and began to perform with many of the Cuban acts in and around Miami. While ‚ÄúMiami marks Ortiz‚Äôs first official solo release under his name he has been at the helm of several acclaimed projects over the past decade from The Gumbi Band that toured throughout the Southeast opening for funk legend George Clinton to working with his newly formed group The Latino Project that have released two successful albums ‚ÄúLa Cura (2000) and Soy De Aqui (2005). This keeps Gumbi moving fast these days to keep up in addition to touring 5-6 months out of the year with guitar legend Al Di Meola. Even so, the rich soil that created this artist and his artistic material is use to the climate in the music business.  Gumbi Ortiz has already received rave reviews from smooth jazz critics around the country.  This CD is one you will have in your musical rotation for quite some time. Enjoy!

<h2>Dr. Art Davis - Legendary bassist, educator, composer
</h2>
<p>In a musical career that has spanned four decades, Dr. Art Davis has played his bass with a myriad of the<br />
greatest jazz, classical, and popular artists in the world. He has shared his talents with not only the best jazz<br />
musicians (John Coltrane, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Lena Horne, Thelonius Monk, Louis Armstrong, Count<br />
Basie, Quincy Jones, etc.), but with notable figures from popular music such as Judy Garland, Bob Dylan, Minne<br />
Pearl, Barbara Streisand, Hank Williams. Davis' career has also seen performances with major orchestras such as the<br />
National Symphony, NBC Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Radio City Music Hall<br />
Symphony, Westchester Symphony, Orange County Symphony and others.<br />
Davis studied the tuba as well as the piano as a boy in his hometown of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania before<br />
switching to the bass in high school. He won numerous awards on both tuba and double-bass while attending high<br />
school. Upon graduation, he moved to New York to study via scholarship at both the Manhattan School of Music as<br />
well as the Juilliard School of Music. While attending the latter he studied with world renown cellist Lazlo Varga<br />
and Anselme Fortier, who was principal bassist with the New York Philharmonic at that time.<br />
Art Davis' recording debut came in 1958 at the Newport Jazz Festival, with Max Roach's group that<br />
included the legendary Booker Little and George Coleman. Davis maintained a strong personal relationship with<br />
Max, and Booker Little became one of his best friends.<br />
John Coltrane came into Art Davis' life while Davis was working with Max Roach's group at Small's<br />
Paradise in Harlem. Coltrane at that time was in Miles Davis' band and between sets asked Art if he would like to<br />
"practice" with him. Art agreed and Coltrane replied "How about tomorrow morning?" At 8:00 the following<br />
morning John Coltrane was in the lobby of Art's hotel and called him on the house phone. After that first meeting,<br />
the two practiced regularly for about a year, the sessions lasting for many hours without a break. It was during this<br />
year that John Coltrane wrote the tune "Giant Steps". Davis credits the association with John<br />
Coltrane as the most intense and enriching musical experience of his career. Until Coltrane's<br />
death in 1967, Art remained close musically and personally with him and was a member of<br />
the bands on several Coltrane albums including, "Ascension", "Africa Brass I and II", "Ol√©!<br />
Coltrane", and others. Art's discography as a member of Coltrane's groups also includes the<br />
original recording of "A Love Supreme" (which remains unreleased) with Coltrane's regular<br />
quartet and Archie Shepp. Art also toured intermittently with John Coltrane. Due to Davis'<br />
studio and other commitments, he was unable to become a permanent member of Coltrane's<br />
quartet, but John insisted on their continued relationship.<br />
Then, in 1959, Davis joined Dizzy Gillespie's band and toured for two and a half years. Weary of the road<br />
he returned to New York and free-lanced. In 1961 Art became the second African-American member of the NBC<br />
Staff Orchestra, working regularly on the Merv Griffin, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson shows (and others), as well as<br />
performing in the New York studios playing jingles, films, and freelancing with performers.<br />
When the Griffin show moved to Los Angeles in 1971 Davis went back to school to pursue his deep<br />
interest in psychology, earning a masters degree in Experimental Psychology from the City College of the City<br />
University of New York and a masters degree and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from New York University by<br />
1982. He supported himself while in college by teaching and performing in Broadway shows.<br />
After receiving his doctorate, he devoted four years to psychology patients and teaching in medical centers<br />
and colleges. In 1986, Davis moved to southern California, where he currently teaches college courses and maintains<br />
a professional practice as well as playing concerts, clubs, and recordings.Throughout his busy career, Davis finds<br />
time to encourage young people to strive toward their highest professional ambitions. His fan club decided to reflect<br />
this concern and established a scholarship program for deserving students.<br />
Then, in 1993, Davis founded a non-profit 501(c3) organization entitled B.A.S.S. (Better Advantages for Students<br />
and Society), enabling donors to deduct their gifts. The Dr. Art Davis Sholarships awarded by B.A.S.S. award<br />
stipends to full time college/university students in all educational disciplines. In 1995, Dr. Davis formed the Gladys<br />
Davis Memorial Scholarships in honor of his late wife who was a health care provider. The Gladys Davis Memorial<br />
Scholarships are open to health care majors only. Dr. Davis continues to be active as a leader in local clubs, private<br />
venues, and cultural events in Los Angeles and Orange Counties.<br />

<h2>Roberto Magris Quartet - Europlane and Alfabeats Nu Jazz-jazz pianist and composer
</h2>
<p>Roberto Magris is from Trieste, Italy a beautiful city that sits above the Adriatic Sea. Roberto began lessons on the piano at the age of four. Soon it was discovered he had perfect pitch and learned to push the piano keys before reading or writing the alphabet. He continued music lessons on the piano until he was 16 and learned to play the music of classical composers such as Mussorgorsky, Arensky and Rachmaninoff. Not only were the sites, sounds and music of this city responsible for shaping this artist, but also the countries that surrounded him like Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Germany and Hungary. However, it was a love for jazz that continued to inspire this prolific writer, especially after listening to jazz legends such as pianist, Oscar Peterson. By 1977, Roberto was a member of Grupo Jazz Marca and recorded three albums with them before forming his own quartet with Ettore Martin on sax, Danilo Gallo on bass, and Enzo Carpentieri on drums. In 1998, he became the Director of the Europlane Orchestra. The goal is to provide an analysis and summary of the terms of the jazz tradition in a European key with reference to the future development with attention on original works and compositions reflecting the European jazz and folk tradition. He extended that concept by including musicians from other countries such as Belgium, Poland and even the United States. Constantly looking for ways to express his artistry, Roberto formed the group DMA Urban Jazz Funk and began to tour and record with this group. An offshoot of this band is Alfabeats Nu Jazz, which expresses new jazz, new age and hip-hop. Roberto is inspired by many forms of music and finds ways to develop and grow his style by playing or combining certain genres such as classical, jazz or jazz and hip-hop.  Roberto has performed all around Europe, in North and South America, Asia and Australia. Look for exciting new releases in 2005 by Roberto Magris, ?Check In? featuring Tony Lakatos on saxophone and ?Il Bello Del Jazz? featuring Herb Geller on saxophone and in 2006 ?Current Views? featuring Phillip Catherine on guitar.

<h2>Mark Saltman, bass William Knowles, piano
</h2>
<p>Composer/musicians Mark Saltman and William Knowles call Washington D.C., home.  Together, they form a collaborative unit that expresses some of the best new concepts in Jazz.  These ideas include singable melodies, colorful harmonic jaunts and  a swinging, driving groove.  One may argue that these concepts are not new; but in light of today‚Äôs gymnastic, angular, chop-blistering approach, these ideas seem refreshing.<br />
<br />
Mark and William met while studying composition at the University of Massachusetts.<br />
During their time at school they began to play their compositions together, and with saxophonist Charles Langford, the seeds of the group were formed.<br />
<br />
Together they have produced three recordings for various labels under the name Soulservice.  Stop Look and Listen followed by Dreamcatcher and Sandcastles. They were also Artists in Residence at the Kennedy Center and earned two grants from the D.C. commission for the Arts.<br />
<br />
The press has described their music as;  ‚Äòrhythmically infectious‚Äò,  ‚Äòmelodically alluring‚Äò, ‚Äòcolorful‚Äô, ‚Äòa seamless blending of sounds‚Äô. Some live press descriptions include; ‚Äúhad the whole house swinging‚Äù, ‚Äúthe crowd was‚Ä¶drawn to the hard breaks, stops and starts.‚Äù; ‚Äúgreat interplay‚Äù and ‚Äúa sincere and emotional collection of tunes‚Äù.<br />
<br />
Throughout history, music has helped folks make sense of their world, deal with troubles, celebrate and convey emotions.  The music of William Knowles and Mark Saltman strives to be a part of this fine tradition.

<h2>Novak & Haar - Jazz Guitar and Bass
</h2>
<p>The core membership of Novak & Haar is made up of guitarist Jon Novak and bassist Mark Haar. Novak & Haar has been performing together as a jazz duo since 1998. Prior to forming Novak & Haar, Jon and Mark had player together in various small jazz combos, large big bands, musical theater ensembles, Blue House with the Rent to Own Horns, and other bands in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, metro areas. When Novak & Haar performs as a trio they add Carlos C. Figueroa on the drum set. In the Spring of 2005, Novak & Haar was added to the Nebraska Arts Council‚Äôs Nebraska Touring Program roster.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúThis up and coming trio Novak & Haar bring a passion for music to the table from a variety of genres. This can be heard in the music they compose. Although their primary voices are in a jazz setting, one can hear a touch of blues and the air of theater and a sprinkling of classics in the material‚Äù, said music impresario Paul Collins. ‚ÄúIn jazz, sometimes it is refreshing to hear variations of the norm performed and enjoy a brief explanation of why or how the music was inspired. As music teachers and performers, Novak & Haar do just that by adding more value and meaning to their compositions through their ‚Äúthoughts about the tracks‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf you love guitar and equally enjoy the bass and drums, you will enjoy these tracks.‚Äù

<h2>Will Matthews - Grammy Award winning jazz guitarist from the Count Basie Orchestra
</h2>
<p>Will Matthews was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. Little did he know that time and experience would reward him with the opportunity to perform in the place of late great Freddie Green, guitarist with the Count Basie Orchestra for 50 years! After performing with several groups around town, Will began performing with world renowned trumpeter Carmel Jones and with Kansas City's own Claude ëFiddlerí Williams, the first guitarist in the Count Basie Orchestra. In 1989, Will had the opportunity to work with another Kansas City jazz legend, Jay McShann. As he continued to grow musically and make a name for himself professionally, other opportunities began to appear in the form of Grammy Award winning pianist and composer, Dr. Ronnell Bright.  Over the years, Dr. Bright earned his reputation by working with legendary jazz vocalists Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Nancy Wilson and Carmen McRae. Dr. Bright was also the musical director for the famous Flip Wilson Show and The Carol Burnett Show, respectively. Who did he want to perform with him when he decided to make Kansas City his home? Will Matthews!<br />
In 1996, under the direction of trombonist Grover Mitchell, Will Matthews was selected to fill the coveted chair of the late great Freddie Green, guitarist for the Count Basie Orchestra. Since joining the orchestra, Will has performed on numerous recordings of which two achieved Grammy Awards. <br />
The Count Basie Orchestra with Will Matthews on guitar, had the honor of performing with Joe Williams, Frank Foster, Benny Carter, Milt Jackson, George Benson, Kenny Burrell, Nancy Wilson, Patti Austin, Marlena Shaw, Tony Bennett, Dianne Schuur and most recently jazz vocalist, Nneena Freelon. They also were invited to perform at the Royal Palace in Bangkok, Thailand and for the former President, William J. Clintonís Inaugural in 1997. <br />
With many musical accomplishments including Grammyís under his belt, this could easily create the perfect recipe for pride, however, such success could never mask this artistsí passion for music or allow egotism to take the seat of modesty. Not only is Will an exceptional guitarist, he is well respected and good friends with his peers. Now that's a true sign of greatness!  <br />

"As all of you guitarists and aficionados know, the late great Freddie Green "never" used an amp with the Count Basie Orchestra during his entire 50 year tenure! I uphold that tradition. I use a condenser microphone positioned in the area of the lower f-hole. This produces the acoustic sound I need for playing the Freddie Green style. For solo feature spots, I use a direct input and a monitor so I can hear myself on stage. Otherwise, I've been using Polytone Mini-Brute, Mega Brute and the Walter Woods Stereo amp. I recently purchased the Clarus 1R made by Acoustic Image and the tone is fantastic! It gives me a very warm sound like a tube amp. I especially like the built-in digital reverb and it only weighs 6.5 pounds. I have a pair of 12in. JBL E-Series speakers that I use with the Walter Woods or the Clarus."

<h2>Gregg Juke - Singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist
</h2>
<p>Gregg Juke, singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist is a native of Buffalo, New York. Gregg  is a 20 year veteran of the music scene in ‚ÄúThe City of No Illusions‚Äù which has spawned the likes of the Goo Goo Dolls, Ani DiFranco, Rick James, award winning bassist Billy Sheehan and countless national recording artists. <br />
Gregg has had a long standing dream to have fun playing with a group of high-caliper musicians that can handle challenging original material as well as classic standards and covers presented in new ways. After performing everyone else‚Äôs songs for nearly two decades, Gregg has formed Gregg Juke and the Mighty No-Stars Blues Band. This group combines original jazz, blues, rock, reggae and roots music with his own brand of contemporary jazz, blues/rock and R&B.<br />
In 1901, Buffalo, New York was the location of the Pan-American Exposition, which was a celebration of light and electricity from the mighty Niagara Falls. A prominent Lake Erie port, Buffalo was ranked 8th in the nation. Many years later with the steel mills closed and many jobs squeezed out of the city, Buffalo‚Äôs economic bright future dimmed, but not the hopes of its citizens. Electricity still fuels the most important commodity, music. Gregg Juke is a product of the passion and determination of its citizens expressed through music.<br />
Music impresario Paul Collins continues, ‚ÄúGregg Juke comes to PCAMI* well reported on by respected music and arts reviewer for the Buffalo News, theatre and film editor of Nightlife Magazine, free lance producer for WNED-TV Channel 17  and educator at the University of Buffalo, Erie County Community College and Canisius College,  Jim Santella. When Gregg and I began talking about music a year ago, I could hear and feel his passion for the music and desire to grow in all directions. We are both very determined to accomplish much for the sake of music, which is the true motivating force much like the force from the mighty waters of Niagara Falls.

<p>There are voices and then there are voices--sultry, sexy voices-that stay with you long after the song has ended. Emerald Jade, has a voice that people have been waiting for; her voice is undoubtedly one of the most classic voices to hit the scene in recent history, since Ella, Dinah, Billie and Sade. Originally from Gary, Indiana now residing in Los Angeles, this mysterious stunning vocalist has created a buzz in the Urban Contemporary Jazz market, everybody wants to know, who is.... That!?! This recording is an instant classic and collectible worthy of being passed down from generation to generation. This release entitled "A NEW CLASSIC" is a collection of songs written by Emerald Jade, speaking about what she wanted in a relationship, unbeknownst to her became a reality while in the process of creating this album with the musical mastermind producer, Craig Monroe. Listening to this gem will treat the listener to a blend of jazzy pop, neo soul, and R & B, with catchy melodies capturing the joy, love, and happiness throughout the entire CD. The opening track "Vibe Queen" is a tribute to the queens before her, who made it possible for her to come along with her vibe. The second track "Delirious" has a guest vocal appearance by her now husband Craig Monroe; this track is about a couple having romantic evenings and endless afternoons with champagne, a bed of roses and a bubble bath. The third track "My Man", an unmistakable classic reminiscent of old school with the new; this is about a woman giving praise to her man who treats her like the queen she is. Track number six "Shine" is dedicated to her talented family of recording artists, "Jesse Powell", "Trina & Tamara" and upcoming soulful vocalist "Jacob Powell", this is where she tells them to "Shine" no matter what, and just keep your head up!

<h2>Chris Burnett - alto, soprano saxophone
</h2>
<p>To hear Chris Burnett‚Äôs music is a study of purpose whose endeavors rewards the listener with dividens of rich music. It is fresh, joyous, teeming with musical adventures yet substantial enough to make it a timeless jazz classic worth repeated listening. "If you are uplifted, inspired and moved by the music, it is the ultimate contribution and reward for the pure artist." It is no wonder that this debut CD ‚ÄúTime Flies‚Äù is a classic in its own right and critically acclaimed around the world. Damian Hagger of Vivendi Universal calls Chris Burnett‚Äôs work ‚ÄúTechnically complex, yet exotically beautiful music that contemporary jazz lovers will devour.‚Äù True to this observation, the music on ‚ÄúTime Flies‚Äù had been downloaded over 509,000 times from the former online music distribution company MP3.com and purchased by numerous jazz aficionados from over 38 countries worldwide. This alone established Chris Burnett as one of the most downloaded independent acoustic jazz artist in the entire 7-year history of MP3.com! If Damian Hagger could see Chris‚Äô online music potential through its content and quality, I will go a step further and say that Chris Burnett is Grammy Award material patiently waiting his turn. My personal favorite on the CD is "Whenever We Cry". The most downloaded track on the CD since it when into digital distribution is "Waltz For Mom". That track maintained the overall #1 Jazz Chart position at MP3.com which included all jazz music subgenres and thousands of individual songs for over 12 weeks! Chris Burnett's music reminds me of one particular Grammy Award winning artist that I heard, met and talked to early in his career. His name is Billy Childs. Billy was  playing piano for the legend Freddie Hubbard and later for more jazz legends The Heath Brothers whenever the amazing pianist Stanley Cowell was not available. Billy Childs has gone on to release a number of CD's, write and co-write number of jazz compositions and work with an amazing jazz vocalist, Dianne Reeves.   The rest, as they say, is history! It is apparent that Chris Burnett has attracted other top notch musicians to assist in his musical expressions. One listen to Jeff Stewart‚Äôs technique and performance on piano is the biggest clue. Equally capable are, Elliot Kuykendall on double bass, Ken Baldwin on drums and Bob Habib on percussion and the innovative online collaborative effort of Ben Lewis on the track ‚ÄúTo Each His Own‚Äù. So, when you hear the words "up tempo", "gorgeous ballad", "complex harmonies", "interesting harmonic twists", "elegant" and "this ensemble cooks" all in one CD, buy it! You have just found a pure classic music masterpiece.

<h2>Winston Byrd-trumpeter from the legendary T.S. Monk Band
</h2>
<p>For a jazz musician just into his thirties (he was born Nov. 27, 1972), Winston Byrd has had a career more like his forbears than his contemporaries. Most of his peers developed their jazz skills and chops in college and music academy classrooms and band rooms. Byrd, like jazz musicians of the mid-20th Century, developed his chops and style on the road and in bands big and small. <br />
‚ÄúI graduated from Gateway Regional High School in southern New Jersey in 1991,‚Äù says the trumpeter who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and the Garden State, ‚Äúand was set to go to The New School. But I was unavoidably detoured to go on the road (initially with The Stylistics), to never return to college.‚Äù <br />
Young Winston's first jazz epiphany came when he heard Maynard Ferguson playing ‚ÄúGive It One‚Äù in a seventh grade music appreciation class. ‚ÄúIt was like somebody hit me in the head with a baseball bat, but I wasn't vibing off so much on the notes he was playing as on his energy, and I said: ‚ÄòThat's for me!!'‚Äù <br />
Soon afterwards, he saw Dizzy Gillespie and Jon Faddis trading solos on ‚ÄúGroovin' High‚Äù on a Grammy Awards TV show. ‚ÄúThat's when I decided I wanted to be a professional musician,‚Äù he says. <br />
The young trumpeter was enamored of high note playing, and worked at being able to articulate in the stratosphere ‚Äúwithout killing myself. It's very difficult, and I mean difficult! I worked at it like a dog.‚Äù <br />
That work paid off as he was able to earn gigs as a lead trumpeter in big bands including those of Illinois Jacquet, David Murray, Slide Hampton, Louie Bellson and Oliver Lake, as well as the Count Basie Orchestra, Village Vanguard Orchestra, Duke Ellington Orchestra and Blood, Sweat and Tears. Faddis became an early role model and mentor, and Byrd has played in the trumpet section of the Faddis led Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band. <br />
Another early influence was Arturo Sandoval, the Cuban trumpeter, who an 18-year-old Byrd heard in high school. ‚ÄúArturo could play romance, bravura, crazy and Hot, but it also just wasn't screeching ‚Äì there was music being made. Jon and Arturo could do that: Play a solo and draw on every bit of soul, heart and drive they could put together, and learned from the master: Dizzy! <br />
‚ÄúLearning from Jon, I went back from Dizzy to Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers all the way back to Pops (Louis Armstrong). And from Arturo I learned about finesse from Uan Rasey, ‚ÄòChocolate' and Felix Chappotin. So musically, I guess you could say Jon and Arturo got together and gave birth to ME.‚Äù <br />
For the last three years, Byrd has been a member of drummer T.S. Monk's Sextet, as well as gigging with other combos featuring the likes of tenor saxophonists Don Braden and Javon Jackson, who have also played on gigs where Byrd was the leader. He's now much more than a high-note specialist, becoming an all-around improviser in swing, hard-bop and post-bop contexts, and a growing master of mutes, from the burry Harmon to the growling plunger. <br />
He's also developing as a jazz composer-arranger with a wide stylistic palette. An All About Jazz review of a performance of Byrd's ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù with a Cape May Jazz Festival All-Star quintet including the trumpeter marveled that it ‚Äú swung along so melodiously and effortlessly you could have sworn it came out of the Benny Carter songbook. ‚Äù <br />
And another critic called Byrd's ‚ÄúLadera Heights,‚Äù on the Monk Sextet's latest album, ‚Äúa smooth concoction that seems to dwell somewhere between Grover Washington and Steely Dan.‚Äù <br />
‚ÄúBenny Carter and Steely Dan. Wow, that says it all, doesn't it?‚Äù says Byrd with pride. <br />
