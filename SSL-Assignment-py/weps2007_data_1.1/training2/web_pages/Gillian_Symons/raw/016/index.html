    <h4 class="sub2"><a name="pgfId-244026"></a>Rice Seed Health Looking
    Shipshape</h4>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244027"></a>Recent visitors to a village
    market in Bogra in Bangladesh found something unusual on display: an array
    of tables and potted rice plants surrounded by a cluster of farmers keen to
    explain how these objects related to improved rice yields in their fields.
    This Going Public exercise was part of an innovative project for improving
    rice seed health amongst resource-poor farmers.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244028"></a>Rice production is crucial to the
    Bangladesh economy. Some 75% of the cropped area and 83% of the total
    irrigated area are devoted to rice cultivation, and an estimated 60-70% of
    the labour force is employed in rice production, processing marketing and
    distribution. However, up to 95% of rice farmers in Bangladesh rely on their
    own seed for establishing the next season's crop. Declining seed quality
    owing to pests and diseases is a major problem, partly attributable to
    improper seed drying and storage during the rainy season. Appropriate farmer
    training (and particularly of women, who are mainly responsible for
    post-harvest activities) would enable farmers to improve seed quality, for
    until now they have had little understanding of the impact of improper
    drying and storage on seed health.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244029"></a>The Seed Health Improvement
    sub-Project (SHIP) operates under the PETRRA (Poverty Elimination through
    Rice Research Assistance) project, funded by DFID (UK Department for
    International Development). SHIP began in 1999 as a collaboration between
    BRRI (Bangladesh Rice Research Institute), IRRI (International Rice Research
    Institute), CABI <i>Bioscience</i> and a number of national and
    international NGOs in Bangladesh. The project is using Participatory
    Technology Development (PTD) and Farmer Participatory Research (FPR)
    approaches to reduce losses in crop yield and post-harvest through the
    development, evaluation and recommendation of appropriate seed health
    practices at farmer, seed industry and research levels.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244030"></a>During the first 18-month phase
    of the project, the existing on-farm situation was assessed regarding
    seed-borne rice diseases and quantified yield losses. Using formal survey
    and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques, socioeconomists from
    IRRI investigated farmers' own perceptions of seed health problems and their
    solution. The survey collected data from 560 plots at seven key sites in
    different agroecological zones of Bangladesh using multistage purposive
    sampling. Also during this phase, farmers' seed management practices were
    assessed together with the effects of improved seed quality on reducing pest
    damage. These activities facilitated the drawing up of a demand-led
    prioritized programme for implementation during the second phase of the
    project.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244031"></a>Farmer training in the first
    phase focused mainly on manual seed cleaning, while local collaborators
    honed skills in collecting and analysing socioeconomic and field pest data.
    Farmer trials in Chuadanga, for example, investigated the performance of
    crop grown from 'cleaned' and 'uncleaned' seed, and the relative expediency
    of different seed cleaning and sorting procedures. Farmers acknowledged that
    using clean seed gave more vigourous and healthier plants and (up to 22%)
    higher yields, and said they would continue to adopt this practice. However,
    they pointed out that seed sorting and cleaning is slow and tedious, is
    difficult for people who are older and/or have bad eyesight, and bending to
    sort on the floor gave back ache. Solutions proposed included involving
    younger people in seed cleaning and sorting, taking breaks from the
    activity, and sorting on a table rather than the floor.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244032"></a>The second phase of the SHIP
    project began in 2001 with activities focused on improving post-harvest
    treatment of rice destined for seed, including drying and storage. Two
    workshops facilitated by CABI <i>Bioscience</i> introduced project staff,
    field researchers, local engineers, administrators, etc. from the seven key
    sites to participatory approaches, including discovery learning, action
    planning, documentation, impact assessment and facilitation (for this last
    topic, CABI <i>Bioscience</i> worked closely with a local facilitator from
    the Participatory Promotors Society of Bangladesh, PPS-BD). Project staff
    and facilitators then initiated FPR/PTD activities in their villages, but
    what each village focused on depended on farmers' priorities and time
    schedules. At an early stage, it became apparent that although there were
    many problems, there was enormous potential and enthusiasm for developing
    appropriate solutions.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244033"></a>In Gazipur, Barisal and Chuadanga,
    FPR focused on assessing storage containers and the use of seed
    preservatives (neem). However, inventorying traditional technologies and
    knowledge may uncover a wider range of options for testing - for example
    different neem preparations, other botanicals such as tobacco, or the use of
    desiccants such as chalk.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244034"></a>In Bogra and Rangpur, the
    emphasis was on developing better drying methods through PTD. Through
    discovery learning, women in one village came up with the concept of mobile
    drying tables, which they subsequently designed and made with the help of
    their husbands or of local craftsmen, using locally available and low-cost
    materials. Drying is particularly problematic for the rice crop harvested at
    the end of April/May, which is the beginning of the rainy (<i>boro</i>)
    season. Improperly dried seed is the primary cause of poor seed health and
    germination during storage. During this project, however, an astonishing
    array of designs has been developed: apart from improved drying all models
    have multi-purpose use: larger stronger tables are used for threshing - and
    relaxing on afterwards! Lighter models are used for storage in the kitchen
    when not needed for drying. There was even a folding table, which could be
    stored on the roof while not in use.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244035"></a>A trial of the innovative
    feedback and scaling-up approach, Going Public, involved a village picture
    exhibition and a crossroads demonstration of the multi-purpose seed drying
    tables developed by the villagers. This stimulated a two-way exchange
    between project participants and passers by and provided quick feedback, new
    perspectives and additional knowledge. A subsequent Going Public session at
    a local market exhibited three models of drying tables, potted mature rice
    displaying disease (brown spot) symptoms, along with cleaned and uncleaned
    seed and 2-week old seedlings grown from the two seed batches. Farmers
    trained through the project took over the role of explaining the benefits of
    cleaned and properly dried seed to their fellow-farmers. A profitable
    side-effect of the project is that the farmers are also developing a
    business mentality and are starting to sell their own quality seed. The
    Going Public approach has provided the trained farmers with confidence to
    start marketing their acquired skills and knowledge. The Going Public
    approach uses an arena where farmers meet naturally, rather than special
    meetings, which has distinct advantages: farmers are not placed in the
    unfamiliar setting of a formal meeting, and resource-poor farmers often
    cannot afford to set time aside for formal training sessions.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244036"></a>Next, the SHIP project aims to
    tackle the effects of pest insects, diseases and weeds in seed health
    through discovery-based learning exercises. CABI <i>Bioscience</i> will
    develop the capacity of local researchers for turning scientific information
    into discovery learning exercises. These are aimed at improving farmers'
    knowledge about storage pests and diseases, including diagnostics, biology
    and ecology and management options. Apart from these activities, training is
    being provided in methodologies for scaling-up and disseminating the outputs
    on a national scale.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244037"></a>Already, though, a shift in the
    mindset of the participating farmers can be seen, from &quot;we know
    nothing&quot; to a level of confidence that allows them not only to make
    suggestions for improving post-harvest technology, but also to take control
    of developing their ideas and communicating their findings to other farmers.
    Such success has been achieved through focusing on the needs of the farmers,
    keeping open minds, and stressing a people-centered rather than a
    technology- or science-focused approach. As a direct spin-off, the national
    research curriculum is now partly driven by project activities in
    communities. In this way, the SHIP project is beginning to have a direct
    impact on improving livelihoods for resource-poor farmers in Bangladesh, but
    the approaches pioneered here have potential applications on a much wider
    scale in other crops and other countries.</p>

    Biocontrol</h4>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244041"></a>The Indian National Research
    Centre for Weed Science (NRCWS) in Jabalpur has gone on the offensive
    against <i>Parthenium</i> <i>hysterophorus</i>, and is busy recruiting the
    general public as allies in its war.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244042"></a>The invasive potential of <i>Parthenium</i>
    in India is fuelled by its capacity to germinate throughout the year in a
    wide range of environments and soils, and the massive numbers of lightweight
    seeds it produces. Quite apart from the losses this leads to in
    agricultural, forestry and horticultural crops, the plant is also allergenic
    and toxic and causes serious health problems in livestock and man.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244043"></a>The NRCWS is therefore developing
    a proactive approach to manage this weed, with public awareness and
    participation playing key roles. It initiated an awareness campaign in and
    around Jabalpur involving governmental and non-governmental organizations,
    residents, schools and village councils [gram panchayats]. At meetings in
    July 2001, local residents saw thousands of biological control agents (the
    Mexican beetle <i>Zygogramma</i> <i>bicolorata</i>) being released, and
    methods of mass rearing were also demonstrated. Cultures of the beetle may
    be obtained free of charge, and cheap and easy rearing methods are being
    developed at NRCWS. After seeing the beetle in action, many people contacted
    the Centre and obtained cultures.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244044"></a>The effect of the beetle releases
    will be monitored over time. It is recognized that this is just the
    beginning, and that complete biological control of this weed is a long way
    off still. However, by engaging the public actively in the process, the
    NRCWS aims to increase the numbers of beetles released, improve public
    understanding of biological control, and increase public awareness of the
    dangers of this weed.</p>

    <h4 class="sub2"><a name="pgfId-244048"></a>Children Trade Places with
    Banana Farmers</h4>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244049"></a>'Trading Places' was the first in
    a series of public Internet debates organized by WWF (the Worldwide Fund for
    Nature). The 2-week debate in March 2002 used bananas to help children
    explore how consumer choices in the UK impact on people and environments
    around the world. The debate formed part of 'Fairtrade Fortnight', a
    campaign by the Fairtrade Foundation that focused on the links between
    consumers and producers. By involving children, WWF aims to bring
    sustainability issues into the classroom, allowing pupils to communicate
    with a range of stakeholders on key environmental questions. The debate
    forms part of WWF's preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable
    Development in Johannesburg, South Africa this September.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244050"></a>For the 2 weeks of the 'Trading
    Places' debate, children between the ages of 9 and 11 took on the role of
    West Indian smallholder banana farmers faced with a series of environmental
    and economic dilemmas. At the outset, they were given fact files on bananas,
    Fair Trade and the World Summit, and an introduction to the banana industry
    and international trade. Competition between large companies and small
    island producers was explained, together with the status of the preferential
    trade agreement between small Caribbean islands and the European Union (the
    World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled to abolish this after representations
    by large banana companies, a decision that is currently under appeal). The
    children opted for one of three roles: a farmer of a long-established
    smallholding who decides to remain independent and hopes the trade agreement
    is upheld; a small farmer who decides to sell his/her land and become an
    employee of a banana company that has a large plantation on the island, or a
    farmer who joins a Fairtrade cooperative. The children were asked to think
    about the wider repercussions of their decision on the families - on their
    ability to grow their own food, for example.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244051"></a>Newsflashes throughout the debate
    gave the youngsters fresh angles to consider and introduced them to problems
    faced by banana growers in an economy heavily dependent on growing and
    exporting bananas to Europe. To help, the children could draw on websites
    and online experts. The debate had input from diverse international banana
    expertise including Agrofair, Banana Link, CABI <i>Bioscience</i>, Chiquita,
    the Fairtrade Foundation, journalists, Oxfam, the Rainforest Alliance, WINFA
    (Windward Islands Farmers' Association) and WWF, as well as real banana
    growers and plantation workers.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244052"></a>The young virtual farmers began
    by having to cope with a hurricane and its aftermath, which led them to
    discuss refugees and disaster relief. Next, the school leaving age was
    raised, and they debated education and child labour issues. A news flash
    reporting alarms about pesticide use in bananas and its health implications
    for workers and consumers prompted a discussion about pesticide safety and
    worker protection. The next flash revealed an outbreak of black Sigatoka (<i>Mycosphaerella</i>
    <i>fijiensis</i>) on organic farms on the mythical island, and they were
    given a briefing on the epidemiology and control of the disease. Subsequent
    discussions brought out the conflicts between organic and non-organic
    production, especially when faced with containing such a disease.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244053"></a>The following news flash
    announced that the large banana company planned to expand its plantation on
    the island, and the children had to consider their options: remain
    independent, sell up or go co-operative. This was followed by the final
    flash, which dealt with the special trade agreement, and the children had to
    re-evaluate their position in the light of the hypothetical failure of the
    appeal.</p>
    <p class="text"><a name="pgfId-244054"></a>The enthusiasm of the children as
    the debate progressed was self-evident. In their summing up, they agreed
    that they had learned a lot about bananas and Fair Trade, and about more
    complex topics such as pesticide use and smallholder livelihoods. Some
    issues were not easy for children to grasp; &quot;difficult but fun&quot;,
    as one student wrote. One great success was the rapport built up between
    children and experts. The children were delighted be able to ask questions
    and to receive answers to every one, and, as Moderator Gillian Symons said,
    they asked some very interesting questions which the experts enjoyed
    answering. She added that the children came to some very thoughtful
    conclusions; WWF representatives will present these to world leaders at the
    World Summit. As Margaret Beckett, Secretary of State, DEFRA (UK Department
    for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) said at the launch of the
    debate, children will be the beneficiaries of the decisions taken by world
    leaders in Johannesburg this year. She described the World Summit as a
    landmark opportunity, 10 years on from the Rio Earth Summit, to set a
    framework for sustainability and improving the quality of life of people now
    and in future generations all over the world. She said that the UK
    government wanted to hear from children: about their concerns and what they
    are prepared to do to tackle some of the problems. WWF will be hosting a
    further primary school debate and two for secondary schools before the World
    Summit takes place.</p>
