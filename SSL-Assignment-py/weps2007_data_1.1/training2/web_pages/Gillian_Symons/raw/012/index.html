An International Centre For Ecological Study<br>
<p>
Towards An Ecological Economics<br>
January 7-27<br>
<p>
Wolfgang Sachs<br>
Paul Ekins  <br>
Pat Conaty<br>
<p>
The theory and the practice of New Economics, oriented towards<br>
sustainability, community and social justice, is being developed in<br>
many countries. In the face of the environmental devastation being<br>
caused by current economic models, how can we move to a more<br>
sustainable economic system? What do the concepts of ecological<br>
sustainability and sustainable development really mean and how can<br>
they be achieved? Can the value of an environment be measured? What<br>
tools for change exist within the current system? Students will<br>
explore how to make the transition for a global to a local economy,<br>
form efficiency to sufficiency and from a linear to a cyclical<br>
process of production. These and other matters will be examined by<br>
three leading thinkers in the field of alternative economics.<br>
<p>
PAUL EKINS is a Research Fellow at Birkbeck College and author of `A<br>
New World Order'. He is one of the founders of the New Economics<br>
Foundation.<br>

Climate Ecology and the Environment and the author of `Global<br>

Education For The 21st Century<br>
Sustainability, Values &amp; Policy<br>
March 17-30<br>
<p>
David Orr   <br>
John Huckle<br>
Ken Webster  <br>
<p>
The current educational system was developed to serve the Industrial<br>
Age. How will education serve the post-industrial age of ecology and<br>
environment? The course will seek to identify the values and social<br>
frameworks that underpin the concept of environmental<br>
sustainability. It will examine our personal anxieties about the<br>
moral, economic and social questions confronting educational policy<br>
makers. It will discuss how education can reflect the challenge of<br>
sustainability and ask what the implications are for the educational<br>
system.              <br>
<p>
This course has been developed by Schumacher College in  association<br>
with the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Westminster College, Oxford .<br>
<p>
DAVID ORR is Professor of Environmental Studies at Oberlin College,<br>
co-founder of the Meadowcreek Project, an environmental education<br>

Work, Technology and Society in the Information Age<br>
 July 14-26<br>
<p>
Jeremy Rifkin  <br>
<p>
The transition from the industrial to the information age has begun.<br>
The social, political and ecological implications of this<br>
technological revolution are immense. In the U.S. alone, it is<br>
estimated that more than 90 million jobs in a labour force of 124<br>
million are potentially vulnerable to replacement by machines. This<br>
course will explore how society will be affected by the wholesale<br>
adoption of new technologies and the attendant decline of mass<br>
employment.<br>
<p>
Issues addressed will include: the genetic age; lifestyle and<br>
consciousness in a nanosecond culture; the future of work;<br>
rethinking ownership in the digital age; and the dawn of the<br>
post-market era.<br>
<p>
JEREMY RIFKIN is President and founder of the Foundation on Economic<br>
Trends. He is author of fourteen books, including `Biosphere<br>
Politics' and `The End of Work'.<br>

Food For The 21st Century<br>
March 10-15 1996<br>

The food economy is currently moving inexorably towards a<br>
capital-rich, intensive system, with profound implications for<br>
people's health, the environment and social justice. The course<br>
explores the current state of UK and global food systems and the<br>
viability of alternative and re-localised methods of food supply.<br>
<p>
TIM LANG, Professor of Food Policy at Thames Valley University and<br>
Chair of the Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Environment (SAFE)<br>
Alliance co-ordinates the programme.<br>
