      <p align="left">The author (<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/contact.htm">Marty Grant</a>) 
      is not related to Hiram Baker as far as can be proven. It is possible that 
      he is a son or grandson of my ancestor <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jacob-ashe.htm">
      Jacob Baker (1760/65)</a>.</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="hiram">
<!-- --></a><b>Hiram Baker</b> was born ca 1803/04 per his age of 46 on the 1850 
census. His second 1850 census entry showed him as age 45, or born ca 1804/05. 
Those match each other pretty closely. Other researchers give his birth as 
&quot;1807&quot; for some reason, though I don't know the source for that. It doesn't 
match either of his 1850 census entries.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram was born in
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/refs/nc/ashe-nc.htm">Ashe Co., NC</a> as proven by his 1850 census 
entry. The Macon County census taker very helpfully included the county of birth 
for everyone, and not just the state.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I don't know who Hiram Baker's 
parents are. I have theorized that he was a son of my ancestor
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jacob-ashe.htm">Jacob Baker (1760/65)</a> since one of Jacob's 
daughters also moved to Macon County. I have also theorized that Hiram is a son 
of <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-thomas-ashe.htm">Thomas Baker (1765-1831)</a> since they lived near each other (in 1830), and 
Hiram did name his oldest son &quot;Thomas&quot; Baker. Other researchers lists Hiram as a 
son of <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-zachariah-ashe.htm">Zachariah Baker (1775/80)</a>, which 
is probably based on Hiram living near Zachariah's widow in 1840.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman">A note about
<a href="http://www.bakerdna.net/">DNA Test Results</a>: A descendant of Hiram 
Baker via his son Thomas Baker has taken the DNA test. His results do not match 
any other Bakers yet. He does not match the Thomas Baker (1711-1777) group, 
which is where he should be if Hiram were a son of Thomas (1765-1831). He also 
does not match other descendants of Zachariah Baker (though only one is in the 
test database so far). Since there is only one Zachariah descendant in the 
database, and only one Hiram descendant, we can't draw any solid conclusions. We 
will know more when there are two or more from each line. [Additional note: The 
DNA test in question was a 12 marker test, which generally isn't enough to go 
on. Apparently it is an 11/12 match with members of the Thomas Baker (1711-1777) 
group. If the test is expanded to 25 or 37 perhaps then we will know more.]</font></i></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Since we have no real proof of 
Hiram's parentage, some census analysis might help. However, due to the large 
number of Bakers in Ashe County, census analysis doesn't really help much at 
all.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">For the 1810 census, Hiram would 
have been about 5 years old, so he should be enumerated in the under 10 age 
group (born 1800-1810). All of the Baker families listed in Ashe County that year had an 
apparent son that age. One of these could be Hiram's father. Unfortunately the 
census taker that year only used initials, so it is difficult to know who was 
who: J. Baker, probably <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-james-ashe.htm">James Baker (1775/80)</a> 
had three sons that age; Z. Baker, likely <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-zachariah-ashe.htm">
Zachariah Baker (1775/80)</a> had one son that age; another J. Baker (still 
unidentified) had five sons that age; another J. Baker, probably
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-john-ashe.htm">John W. Baker (1783)</a> had two sons that age; S. 
Baker, likely <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-samuel-ashe.htm">Samuel Baker (1755/65)</a> had 
four sons that age; M. Baker, likely <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-morris-ashe.htm">Morris 
Baker (bef 1755)</a> had one son that age; and finally, another S. Baker, likely
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-solomon-ashe.htm">Solomon Baker (1770)</a> had two sons that age. 
As you can see the 1810 census does not narrow down the list of possible parents 
for Hiram Baker, for every Baker household in the county that year had at 
least one son of approximately the same age.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In 1820 Hiram Baker would probably still be home 
with his parents. He should have been enumerated in either the 16-25 age group 
(born ca 1794/1804) or in the 10-15 age group (born ca 1804/10), depending on 
what his actual birth date was. <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jacob-ashe.htm">Jacob Baker 
(1760/65)</a>, my ancestor, had one apparent son in each of those age groups;
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-james-ashe.htm">James Baker (1775/80)</a> had two sons of 
matching ages; <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jonathan-ashe.htm">Jonathan Baker (1775/80)</a> 
had three possible matching sons; <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-thomas-ashe.htm">Thomas Baker 
(1760/65)</a> had one matching son; <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-zachariah-ashe.htm">Zachariah 
Baker (1775/80)</a> had one matching son; <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-elijah-ashe.htm">Elijah 
Baker (1794/1800)</a> had one matching male, and <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-john-ashe.htm">
John Baker (1783)</a> had one matching son. Like the 1810 census, the 1820 
census does not help narrow down the suspects too much. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram Baker married <b>Nancy ---</b> just before 
1830 in Ashe Co, NC. George Windes (a descendant of Hiram and Nancy) thinks 
Nancy's maiden name may have been Ray. He may be correct, as Ray was a well 
known name in Ashe County, and that family was associated with some of the other 
Baker's there. However, Ralphe Baker, another descendant of Hiram says that 
Nancy was a Saunders. I don't know which is correct, if either. I've not seen 
evidence either way.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram Baker was listed on the 1830 census very 
close to the <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-thomas-ashe.htm">Thomas Baker</a> family (could be 
his father). On this census, he was listed as Hiram Jr, as there was an older 
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-hiram-ashe.htm">Hiram Baker</a> in the same county (a cousin probably 
who was about 10 years older). </font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram Baker and family left Ashe Co, 
NC sometime between 1845 and 1850 and moved to
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/refs/nc/macon-nc.htm">Macon Co, NC</a>. For some 
reason they were listed on  the 1850 census in Macon Co, NC and in nearby
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/refs/ga/union-ga.htm">Union Co, GA</a> the same year. It is 
clearly the same family, but the listings are slightly different. In Macon 
County they were  about 50 houses from Mary Margaret Baker Fouts (daughter of
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jacob-ashe.htm">Jacob Baker</a>). In 1850 
Macon Co, NC, Hiram's married daughter Elizabeth and her husband Joseph Hampton 
were residing with them. In their 1850 Union Co, GA listing, they were not with 
them, nor listed separately in that county. In 1850, Macon County, NC and Union 
County, GA were fairly close together, though not quite bordering each other, 
but pretty close. Hiram's family were the only Bakers in Macon County in 1850 
(excluding Mary Margaret Baker Fouts mentioned above).</font></p>
