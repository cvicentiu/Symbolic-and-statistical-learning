EARLY HISTORY OF THE GEORGE BAKER FAMILY OF
BENNINGTON CO., VT., AND OTSEGO CO., N.Y.

Compiled by
Zervia Barnes Birdsall and Mildred Birdsall Covert
1908-1912

     George Baker was one of the pioneer settlers of Pownal, Vermont.  
This place was first settled by the Dutch in 1724, but the town government 
was not organized until 1763, when the town was named in honor of Thomas 
Pownal, governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1757-1760.  It formed part 
of the territory know as the New Hampshire Grants, over which there was so 
much trouble with New York, as that colony claimed the land which really 
belonged to the New England territory.
     The first known reference to George Baker contained in early records 
is found on page 283, Vol. I, Vermont Historical Society Collection, where 
his name appears, with other residents of Pownal, as one of the signers of 
a petition to the King, dated Nov. 1766, in which the King is requested to 
restrain the New York colonists from further encroachments on the New 
Hampshire Grants.
     Prior to 1766 nothing is positively known concerning George Baker but 
it is believed that he was born in Massachusetts about 1730.  Some papers 
belonging to Leroy Baker of Osceola, Tioga Co., Pa., record statements 
made by Chauncey Baker (son of George, whose father was Daniel  Baker) to 
the effect that Daniel's father, George Baker of Pownal, Vt., came to this 
country with two brothers, one of whom was Col. William Henry Baker.  
But as no other record to substantiate this has been found, it seems more 
probable that he was a descendant of Edward Baker of Lynn, Mass., who 
was a freeman of that town in 1638 and who died there in 1687.  The 
"New England Genealogical and antiquarian Register," Vol. V, p. 190, 
contains considerable data concerning this family, in substance as follows: 
It is known that this Edward Baker had five sons, possibly more - Joseph 
and Timothy of Northampton, Edward and Thomas of Lynn, and John of Dedham.  
Timothy was the leading character of Northampton.  He had five children, 
John (1680), Thomas (1682), Edward (1685), Prudence (1687), Deliverance 
(1689).  The oldest son, John, Capt. John Baker, lived on the old homestead 
in Northampton and was one of the most influential men of the town.  
He had seven sons, John, Noah, Aaron, Elisha, Stephen, Timothy, Elijah, 
and two daughters.  All the sons except Timothy, who died while on the 
expedition against Louisburg, married and settled in western Massachusetts; 
all lived to be 80 years old or over, and all left numerous families 
whose descendants are all over the United States from Vermont to Texas.  
Perhaps George Baker was son

2
one of the younger sons of Thomas or Edward, sons of Timothy Baker of 
Northampton, or it may be that his father was one of the other sons of 
John Baker who was the oldest son of Timothy.
     The early records of Pownal town give the following data about George 
Baker and some of his family.  In the earlier records the name is spelled 
Bacor, but afterwards Baker.
     (1) There were six school districts in Pownal in the early days, and 
the fifth district is described as follows: "Beginning at John Matison's 
north to George Bacor's, thence to Bennington line, going east on the 
First District, all to be one district."
     (2) A deed given by George Gardner to Benjamin Gardiner, recorded in 
Vol. II of the town records gives one boundry as follows: "thence running 
to the old fence now standing where George Bacor once lived."  This deed 
is dated "the 22nd day of February in the 15th year of His Majestie's reign," 
that is Feb. 22, 1775, as George III became King in 1760. The clause "where 
George BAcor once lived" is significant as it proves that he had changed his 
place of residence in Pownal prior to 1775.
     (3) Vol. II of the records contains several lists of Pownal freemen and 
of those who took the freeman's oath for the first time in certain years.  
The list of those resident in 1773 include George Baker and the same list 
records Joseph Briggs, afterwards Capt. Briggs, and many others who were in 
Briggs' company with George Baker and Daniel Baker, in service of the United 
States during the Revolution.  The list of those who took the freeman's oath 
in 1782, all of whom must have been 21 years old or over, gives Daniel Baker, 
probably the son of George.  This lists in the early records of Pownal are 
fast becoming illegible and for that reason they are given.

     (4) The first known recorded deed of property owned by George Baker is 
given in Vol. II of the Pownal records.  By this deed, dated and recorded 
April 28, 1784, David Page conveys to George Bacor, both of Pownal, a 
parcel of land situated in the N.W. part of Pownal, bounded as follows: 
"Adjoining west on a lot of land lately owned by Capt. Briggs, now the 
property of Abel Parker, north on a 90 A. lot laid out for the use of 
schools in Pownal town, east on Francis Bates' land, south on the highway 
north of Jonathan Cards' land, containing 45 A. and is the 4th division 
lot laid out to the right of Nathaniel Phelps, original grantee in said 
town of Pownal."  The price paid was £ 22. 10 s.
     (5) Vol. III records that November 28, 1788, Josiah Bates conveyed to 
George Bacor for the sum of £ 2, a small tract of land adjoining the property 
he bought of David Page.
     (6) Vol. V records the transfer of the above properties by George Baker 
(spelling changed in this deed) to Benjamin Gardner and Silas Card of Pownal.  
The total purchase price was $900.00.  The date of sale is February 15, 1798, 
and the deed was recorded February 19, 1798.  No other records of property 
transfer to or by George Baker occur in Pownal records, and it is supposed 
that he went to Otsego County, N.Y., directly after the sale of his Pownal 
farm.  This farm of 45 A. is situated in the hill country a few miles from 
Pownal Center, in the N.W. part of Pownal township.  It is now part of a 
350 A. farm owned by Mr. Frank Wilson, but is still called the Baker lot.  
A complete record of all transfers of this property with description of 
boundries, and other interesting matter, has been compiled and is now in 
possession of the

4
historian.   The place where the old house stood overlooks the highway which 
led from the Vermont settlements to those near Albany, N.Y.  Looking to the 
south one gets a beautiful view of Greylock, the most famous of the Berkshire 
Hills, and it is worthwhile to remember that George Baker and his family, 
sturdy pioneers living there so many years ago, looked daily upon a landscape 
which is now one of the most famous in all New England.
       (7) Vol. III records the purchase of property by Wm. Bacor, possibly 
a son of George, who bought 25 A. of William and Gardner Hall July 10, 1794, 
the price being £40.  In 1798 Wm. Baker sold this land, except a small tract 
containing a mill, and in 1799 he sold the mill with its surrounding plot.  
No further records of property owned by Wm. Baker appear in the Pownal 
records.  He probably went to New York State, perhaps to Otsego County.  
According to tradition he afterward went to Philadelphia and became very 
wealthy.
     (8) The first census of Vermont, taken in 1790, records George Baker 
as follows:  George Baker, Pownal Town, free white males of 16 years and 
upwards, including heads of families, one; free white males under 16 years, 
two; free white females including heads of families, three; no other persons, 
no slaves.
     This means that in 1790 there were only four children at home, two 
boys under sixteen, probably Joseph and Stephen, and two daughters, Asa 
and Susan.
     (9) The Vermont Revolutionary Rolls, p. 88, record George Baker and 
Daniel Baker as having served in the company of Capt. Joseph Briggs from 
October 1, 1778 - November 24, 1778.
     The Vermont records are very incomplete and no known record exists 
to prove that George Baker took part in the battle of Bennington, but 
family tradition and abundant proofs of his residence in Vermont, in 
the vicinity of Bennington, from 1766 to 1798, make one certain that such 
service was rendered.  Perhaps he was a member of Col. Herrick's body of 
militia or of Capt. Dewey's  company in Col. Brush's militia.  Egbert 
Baker of Harpursville, who died in 1908, had the powder horn which, 
according to tradition, was carried by George Baker in this battle.  
Egbert received it from his father Reed, son of Thomas, to whom it was 
given by his (Reed's) grandfather, George Baker.  Mr. Ezra Stevens, an 
old resident of Milford, recalls some stories of the Revolution which he 
heard told by Thomas Baker's children.  He says that George Baker and 
three of his sons were at Bennington battle and that Thomas, who was 
but a lad, went with his father's team to help clear the slain from the 
field.  The records in possession of Leroy Baker (see p. 1) also state 
that George

5
Baker and three of his sons were soldiers in the Revolution.  Mr. Stevens 
says that one of the older sons, Abel Aylesworth Baker, was a colonel in 
the Colonial army.
     Ezra Stevens' father, William Stevens, came to Otsego County in 1784, 
and lived for many years near Schuyler Lake.  When he went to live in the 
town of Milford in 1798, some of the Bakers were there and it is supposed 
they came in the early 90's, perhaps in 1792.   The first recorded deed 
of property owned by the family is that of the Thomas Baker farm, 108½ A. 
from the Otego patent, purchased in December, 1794 of William Temple 
Franklin, through his agent, William Cooper.  The price paid was £119. 4s. 9d.  
Since 1794 this farm, near Milford, N.Y., has been owned by some member 
of the Thomas Baker family.  It is now the home of Ralph Baker, son of 
Warren L., whose father was Leonard, son of Thomas, son of George Baker 
of Pownal.  Edward Baker's farm was also from the Otego patent, bought of 
Thomas Mumford in November 1796, 46 ¾ A., for £130. 19s 8d.  The first 
recorded deed of property owned by George Baker in Otsego County was placed 
on file March 18, 1819, though the farm was purchased in 1812.  It contained 
102 A. and was distinguished as farm, or subdivision B of lot No. 45 in the 
13000, A. of land, on a branch of the Susquehanna River and Cherry Valley 
Creek, granted by letters patent to Volkert Outhoudt and six others.  
It is probable that George Baker lived on this farm, some years before he 
owned it.  The farm was purchased of the executors of Catherin Lawrence of 
New York City and the sum paid for it was $612.00 "of good and lawful money 
of the United States."  The descriptions and legal terms of the old-time 
deeds differ from those of today, and as a matter of interest and as 
something of a curiosity, the following quotation from the deed of the 
property  to George Baker is given:

     Immediately following the record of this deed, the transfer of this 
farm, March 17, 1819 by George Baker and Elizabeth, his wife, to their 
son Stephen, is recorded, the date of record being March 18, 1819, when 
George Baker appeared before John Russel, Judge of Common Pleas, and 
acknowledged the deed.  The farm remained in Stephen's possession and he 
lived there until his death, February 13, 1831.  After Stephen's death 
his son Daniel had the farm until February, 1832, when it was sold by him, 
ad administrator, to Moses and Ester Chidester of Milford.
     From time to time the Chidisters sold portions of the farm until 
only 77 ¾ A. remained of the original 102 A.  This remaining plot changed 
hands several times and March 23, 1868, it became the property of Edward 
Seeger who paid $6000 for it.  In 1870 he sold two lots, one of 10 A. 
and one of 8 A., and in November 1876, the remaining 59 ¾ A. were deeded 
to his son Dudley Seeger, who son Levant, now owns what remains intact 
of the farm George Baker purchased in 1812.  The historian has a complete 
record of all transfers of this farm from 1812-1912.
     The house in which Mr. Seeger lives was built by Stephen Baker, but 
several changes from the original plan have been made since Edward Seeger 
became the owner.  Originally there were two large fireplaces.  These have 
been removed, though the foundation of the great chimney, about 12 feet 
square, is still standing in the cellar.  It was impossible to remove 
this, as the whole structure rests upon it.  The house is very desirably 
located on a gently sloping hill on the west bank of the Susquehanna River.  
The view from any point is attractive.  The winding river merging into 
Goodyear Lake, the thickly wooded hills that bound the valley, the uplands 
from the flats occupied by prosperous farmers whose homes are most inviting, 
and just to the south, the little church at Milford Center with its white 
spire above the clustering maples, a landmark of historic prominence - 
all this and much more makes the old homestead seem a goodly heritage and 
one is glad to recall the valley as a place toward the settlement of which 
one's ancestors contributed both labor and capital.
     It is interesting to know that the site of the first school house in 
the town of Milford (1794) was on the George Baker farm.  In this log 
school house, which stood a short distance to the north of the Baker 
homestead, the Baptist church of Milford Center was organized by Rev. 
Josiah Morris, March 13 and 14, 1805.
     George Baker lived to be a very old man.  A Mr. Rowland of Milford, 
who died several years ago at 90 some years of age, told Alfred Baker 
of Laurens,

8
1819, when he acknowledged the deed of his farm to his son Stephen, and 
November 8, 1819, when Mr. Stevens was born.
     The vital statistics were poorly kept during the early days of Pownal 
and they contain no record of the marriage of Geoge Baker or of the birth 
of any of his children.  It is supposed that he married Polly Brown, 
perhaps about 1756, and that they had ten children, as followes: Abel, 
Daniel (1760)?, William, Charles, Edward (1766)?, Thomas (1768), Asa (a 
daughter), Joseph, Stephen (177…Susan.  It is possible that the wife, 
Polly, died, before George Baker left Vermont; indeed that may have been 
the reason for his disposing of his Pownal farm in 1798 and going to New 
York State, where several of his children had already established homes.  
The deed of the Otsego County farm to the son Stephen in 1819 is executed 
by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife, but the last name of the second 
wife is still unknown.
     Nine of George Baker's children married, and it is positively known 
that Daniel, Edward, Thomas, Joseph and Stephen came to Otsego County, 
N.Y.  Probably Asa and William were for a time in Otsego county.  The 
following information concerning the ten children mentioned above is of 
interest to all descendants of George Baker:
     (1) ABEL BAKER.  The records of Seneca County, N.Y., under date of 
March 10, 1832, give Abel Baker as a resident of the town of Owasco, County 
of Cayuga and record the sale by him of some Seneca County property.  The 
deed is witnessed by Elisha Baker.  In the Cayuga records, the first entry 
under Abel Baker, April 23, 1822, records him as paying $1,000 for a portion 
of lot No. 38 in the town of Sempronius.  Various other records follow 
which Abel Baker and Aurora Baker, his wife, transfer parts of this plot 
in lot No. 38, receiving in all much more than was paid for it.  If the 
family records are true in respect to George Baker's son Abel going "out 
Seneca County way", the entries mentioned must refer to him, as no other 
Abel Baker is given in Seneca or Cayuga records prior to or from 1822 to 
1832.  Newell and Lorenzo Baker of Seneca County, grandsons of Abel Baker, 
were in the Civil War with Harrison T. Baker, son of Russel, son of Thomas 
of Milford, N.Y.
     (2) DANIEL BAKER.  The town records of Pownal, Vermont record Daniel 
Baker as having taken the Freeman's oath  in 1782, so he must have been at 
least 21 years old at that time.  He is known to be one of George Baker's 
older children and it is probable that he was in the Revolutionary War 
with his father…On p. 88 of the Vermont Rolls a Daniel Baker is recorded 
as having served in Capt. Joseph Brigg's company from October 1, 1778 to 
November 24, 1778, the same company and service as that of George Baker.  
Family tradition has it….

9
some of George's children came to Otsego Co. several years before he did.  
Chauncey Baker states, in the records which Leroy Baker has, that Daniel 
came to Laurens, N.Y. when his son George was about 10 years old, or about 
1799, but is seems probable that he came earlier than that.  Possibly the 
Daniel Baker recorded in the first census (1790) as a resident of Otsego 
town, Montgomery County, N.Y., is this Daniel Baker.  The following is 
given concerning him: Free white males over 16 years, two; free white males 
under 16 years, two; free white females, three.
     The first recorded ded of property owned by Daniel Baker is that which 
conveyed to him in 1800 a 50 A. plot in Otsego County, in Lot No. 45 of 
the Otego patent, granted to "Thomas Wharton and others."  Daniel Baker's 
estate at the time of his death comprised several hundred acres, as there 
are records showing that his son George bought of Daniel Baker's heirs 
(1) 100 A. March 8, 1813; (2) of Nathan Baker and his wife Hannah, 100 A. 
of land belonging to the estate of Daniel Baker, and a little late (3) 
50 A. more, July 17, 1819; also 100 A. of Benjamin Howe and wife, the plot 
being described as part of the lot belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker.  
In December 1822 James Green and Asa Baker Green, his wife, signed over 
their claim to her brother George, which leads one to conclude that George 
Baker, son of Daniel, may have acquired title to all of his father's property.  
These records establish the fact that Daniel Baker must have died between 
the year 1800 when he purchased the 50 A. plot and March 8, 1813, when the 
first sale of property belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker is recorded.  
His wife survived him many years.  The county records state under date 
of May 25, 1830, that Susannah, wife of Daniel Baker, deceased of Laurens, 
deeded to George Baker a 100 A. lot.  Early family records give the name 
of Daniel's wife as Anna Cumins; either he was twice married or the name 
Anna was short for Susannah. *
     Daniel Baker had ten children: Nathan (b. 1785, m. Hannah Wood), Betsey 
(b. 1786, m. John Richardson), ** George (b. 1789, m. Susan Nott), Asa 
(b. 1792, m. James Green), Loray (b. 1795, m. Elizabeth Lamb), Lydia 
(b. 1796, m. Jeptha Baker), Hannah (b. 1798, m. Benjamin Howe), Polly 
(b. 1791, m. Joseph Guiles), Aaron (b. ____, m. Polly ____), Anna (b. 1801, 
m. Benjamin Gile).

     In the genealogy of the George Baker, which is being compiled by the 
historian, over a thousand descendants are recorded, but the record of names 
and dates is not strictly accurate nor is it sufficiently complete to 
warrant publication.  This brief history is of more importance than the 
genealogy would be, as much of the information has been obtained from 
records that many of the family cannot consult conveniently.  Sufficient 
data is given to enable any member of the family to prove eligibility for 
membership in the patriotic societies, Sons of the American Revolution and 
Daughters of the American Revolution, provided his or her ancestry can be 
traced back to George Baker of Pownal, Vermont, or Daniel Baker, his 
son, also of Pownal.
     The first descendant to join the DAR on the service of George Baker 
was Harriet Lorena Birdsall (admitted February, 1910) of Binghamton, New 
York, daughter of Zervia Barnes Birdsall, whose mother was Lovina Baker, 
daughter of Stephen, son of George Baker of Pownal.  Other members of the 
family in the Stephen Baker, Daniel Baker, and Thomas Baker lines have 
joined this Society, and without doubt the coming years will see many of 
the George Baker family enrolled in the DAR and also in the SAR.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO. From 
1773 to 1903
by EZRA STEVENS

George Baker's Family 

George Baker of Bennington, was the next settler at Milford Center. He 
came in 1785, purchased a farm just north of Mr. Mumford's large purchase, 
which is owned & occupied by Dudley Segar at present. Mr. Baker had seven 
sons & two daughters. His sons names were Abel, Daniel, Charles, Thomas, 
Edward, Joseph, & Stephen. His daughters names were Asie & Susan. 

Mr. Baker sold his farm in Vermont, when he removed to Milford, there was 
$500 remaining unpaid on it. He sent his oldest son, Col. Abel to Vermont 
for the money. He collected the money & that was the last ever heard of 
him. It was believed by some that he skipped with the money; & by others 
that he was robbed & murdered. At all events he was never heard from after 
he received the money. 

Mr. Baker's 4th son Thomas married Sarah Morton & located at Edson Corners. 
Edward married Hannah Mumford. Charles, Stephen & Joseph all married & 
raised large families. Daniel married Susannah (Anna) Cumins. Charles, 
Stephen, and Joseph all married and raised large families and located in 
different towns. Edward Baker's oldest son, George left home and went to 
New York in 1830 and never returned to Milford. He remained in the city 
and when the T______ cholery broke out in 1832, it was supposed he was 
one of the subjects for he was never heard from after. His daughter Linda 
and his youngest son, Mumford Baker, removed to Pennsylvania. Both married 
and never returned to Milford. George, Daniel's son, married and settled 
in Laurens. Stephen remained on his father's farm in Milford Center until 
his death. He had one son Daniel who married Nancy Keyes, sold the old 
farm that was first settled by his grandfather and returned to Laurens.

The following served in the Northern Division under Arnold, Gates, and 
Stark: Col. Abel Baker, major Gidean Marlette, Privates George Baker, 
Daniel Baker, Charles Baker, Artemas Ward, James Frasier, James Westcott, 
Lemuel Lilly.

George Baker and his three sons Abel, Daniel, and Charles, and Judah Waters, 
and Jacob Wellman participated in the battle of Bunker Hill, and afterwards 
Abel Baker, Judah Waters, and Jacob Wellman were transferred to the regular 
army under General Washington.

Biographical History of the Baker Family

George Baker, the senior of the Baker family, was born in England before 
1600, and was persecuted for his religious proclivities; consequently, he 
took refuge in Holland. He joined the Puritans and embarked in the Mayflower, 
with the Pilgrims and came to America, and landed at Plymouth in 1620. Mr. 
Baker, afterwards, settled near Boston, Massachusetts. I think that George 
Baker., the first Baker that settled in Milford was a grandson of the 
Baker that came from England. George Baker, of the first Milford, one of 
the settlers, was at Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill. At the battle of 
Bunker Hill, his three oldest sons, participated with their father in the 
fight. His sons' names were Abel, Daniel, and Charles. 

Abel was promoted to the office of Colonel and after was under Washington 
in the main Army. It is stated in an antecedent chapter, that Abel was 
sent to Bennington by his father to collect a sum of money and that was 
the last that was heard of him.  That was a mistake. It was learned after 
that he procured the money and with what he had of his own, he went to 
Philadelphia, and went to speculating and became immensely rich. But he 
never returned his father's money. 

The old gentleman, when he 1earned the facts in the case, felt very much 
grieved over his misconduct towards his father. He was a man that stood 
high in the community, and little did he think, his son would resort to 
so comtemptible and outrageous an act as to rob his father of his money, 
when he had placed confidence in his integrity. The old man felt very much 
grieved and said he deserved severe punishment. The poor old man had the 
misfortune to die a horrible death from the effects of a cancer. 

Mr. Baker was in the hard fought battle of Bennington, under General Stark, 
who said, we will win this battle or Mollie Stark will sleep a widow tonight. 
Mr. Baker sent for his son Thomas to fetch his horses to carry in the wounded, 
and disabled soldiers, and tell the people we have killed all the Indians 
and Tories this side of hell.

Dear Mary,
     I think I’ve had a breakthrough on our family tree concerning
Chauncey Baker.  On the Mormon website at www.familysearch.com, I found
an entry for a “Chauncey Baker” who was born on Feb. 12, 1817 in
Milford, (Otsego County) NY to Susan Nott and George Baker and died in
1907 in Knoxville, PA.
     I knew our Chauncey Baker was born in Otsego County around that
time, so I sent to Pennsylvania for his death certificate which showed
him as dying in Shippen, PA on October, 21, 1907 and being buried in
Knoxville, PA on October 24, 1907.  The death certificate listed his
father as George Baker and his mother as Susan Knox.  It also says that
he was born on Feb. 19, 1817 in Otsego County, NY.
     I still wanted more evidence that this was our Chauncey, so I
checked out the Census records to see if there were any other Chauncey
Bakers around the same age.  In the index to the 1850 census I found
five Chauncey Bakers.  Our Chauncey Baker was 32 years old living in
Bainbridge, NY.  Of the other Chaunceys, one in Allegany County was 57
years old (too old to be confused with our Chauncey).  Another in
Granger County, Ohio was age 47, also too old to be confused with our
Chauncey.  The remaining two were Chauncey S. Baker, a 27 year old
clergyman, who was born in Vermont, living in Lancaster, NY and Chauncey
Baker age 31 living with his 27 year old wife Emeline in Sodus, NY.
     I then looked for these three Chauncey Bakers in the 1880 census.
The 1880 Census index showed four Chauncey Bakers born around the same
time.  The first was born in Maine and was living in California,
definitely not our Chauncey.  The second was the  Chauncey S. Baker,
born in Vermont, and still living in New York State (the clergyman from
the 1850 Census).  The third was a New York born Chauncey Baker living
in Antwerp, Michigan with his wife Emmaline (obviously the Chaucey from
Sodus, NY).  The remaining Chauncey was living in Deerfield in Tioga
County Pennsylvania.  He was 63 years old, born in New York living with
a wife named Lucy in the home of his son James Baker (aged 28) also born
in New York.
    Since this last is obviously the Chauncey Baker who died in 1907,
and we know he was born in Otsego County like our Chauncey, I feel
certain that this is probably our ancestor.  Since our Chauncey was
married to  an Abigail in 1850 and the Tioga county Chauncey was married
to a Lucy, I am guessing that he remarried after Abigail’s death
sometime between 1850 and 1880.
    I did not find Chaucey or George Baker in the 1860 Census in either
Bainbridge, NY or Shippen, Knoxville, or Deerfield Township,
Pennsylvania.  I did find George Baker aged 24 in the 1870 Bainbridge
census.  I also found Chauncey in the 1900 Census for Shippen in Tioga
County, Pennsylvania.  He was living with his daughter Libbie A.
Schoonover (born Feb. 1858 in PA) and her husband Chester Schoonover.
They were living next door to Charles L Baker (born April 1856 in PA)
and his family.  I think it is likely that Chauncey and his family moved
to Pennsylvania between 1850 and 1856 and that George Baker returned to
Bainbridge, NY before 1870.
     According to the Mormon website, George Baker, (the father of
Chauncey Baker) was born in Pownal, Vermont on April 15, 1789 to Daniel
Baker and Susanna Cumins and died on Sept. 25, 1862 in Laurens, NY.  His
father Daniel was born around 1760 in Pownal Vermont to another George
Baker and Polly Brown.  Daniel died on March 8, 1813 in Milford, NY.
Daniel’s father, George Baker is listed as having been born in
Massachusetts in 1730 and having died in Milford, NY on November 8,
1819.
     I looked up George Baker (1789-1862) in the 1850 & 1860 Censuses.
The 1850 Census shows him age 61 living in Laurens, NY with his wife
Susannah (age 54) and five children.  He is listed as having been born
in Vermont and his wife is listed as having been born in New York.  In
the 1860 Census they are now alone.  He is age 71 and she is age 64.
They are both listed as having been born in Connecticut.
     I also found a website at
http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyotsego/histmil1.htm which is titled “EARLY
HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO. From 1773
to 1903” by EZRA STEVENS.  It includes a lot of information about the
Baker family and how Daniel and George fought in the Revolutionary war
and were among the first settlers of Milford, NY.  Some of the
information is not completely accurate however.  They claim the Bakers
go back to a George Baker who fled to Holland for religious freedom and
then came over on the Mayflower.  I checked the records and there was no
George Baker on the Mayflower.  Perhaps it was an ancestor by a
different name who came on the Mayflower.  I also doubt that they took
part in the battles of Lexington and Concord since they lived in
Vermont.
     If I find anything else, I’ll let you know.  I plan to look for
Chauncey in the 1860 & 1870 censuses and to see if I can find his burial
records in Knoxville, PA.  Perhaps I can find Abigail’s burial as well.
Wish me luck!
Your cousin,
Tony

Research Update 2004.12.24!  1860 Census confirms that the Chauncey Baker in Tioga county Pennsylvania and the Chauncey Baker who lived in Bainbridge, New York in 1850 are the one and the same.  Chauncey, his wife Abigail, and their children Eliza, Henry, Erastus, George, Jonathan, & Samuel are in both censuses with their ages changed by 10 years as we would expect.
