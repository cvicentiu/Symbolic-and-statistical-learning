      <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jacob-ashe.htm">Jacob Baker (1760/65)</a>, but no proof of 
      that yet. They may not be related at all.</p>

      Molly applied for a pension based on his service.</font></i></p>

      <a href="http://www.bakerdna.net/">Baker DNA Study</a>: No proven 
      descendant of Thomas Baker has yet taken the test, however if his 
      parentage is correct, he should match those in the &quot;Thomas Baker 
      1711-1777&quot; group, for that Thomas (1711) is grandfather to Thomas (1765). 
      This Baker DNA group has four participants so far, all of whom are from 
      David Baker (1749-1838) who would be an uncle of this younger Thomas 
      (1765). They all match one another as they should. One DNA match is a 
      descendant of <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-jackson-ashe.htm">Adam Jackson Baker (1815)</a>. 
      His parents are unproven but some think he is a son of Thomas (1765). DNA 
      certainly supports that theory but doesn't prove it.</font></i></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thomas Baker </b>was born 
1760/65 per census analysis. His widow stated that he was 66 when he died in 
March 1831. If correct, that puts his birth year at either 1764 or 1765, both of 
which match his census records. I don't know where he was born exactly, though 
certainly in Virginia (probably Culpeper County).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Baker appears to be a son 
of <b>William Baker and Anne Gambill</b> of Culpeper and Botetourt Co., VA. I 
have not researched that family, but I've seen bits of evidence that seem to 
support this connection.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When Thomas was still young his 
father was killed by Indians. Thomas was principally raised by his uncle Martin 
Gambill.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Baker served as a Private 
during the Revolutionary War under Capt. William Nall and Capt. Martin Gambill, 
under Col. Benjamin Cleveland and Gen. Griffith Rutherford.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">After the war Thomas Baker 
married <b>Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Cantrell</b> in Wilkes County. Her maiden name and the 
date of marriage was given in her widow's pension application. In her first 
deposition (7 Dec 1851) she listed 20 Mar 1786. In another deposition (31 Aug 
1854) she listed 20 Mar 1787, and finally in 1856 she listed 22 Sep 1787. I 
assume the last is most accurate. She mentioned she had no record of the 
marriage, nor was there a marriage bond for they married &quot;by publication&quot; 
(banns). They were married in Wilkes by William Nall, Justice of the Peace.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mary or Molly was born ca 
1767/68 per her age of 82 on the 1850 census.&nbsp; In her deposition of 7 Dec 
1851 she was listed as 83 years old, which agrees with the 1850 census entry. 
She stated she had no record of her age, and that her husband was &quot;much&quot; older 
than she. Actually he was only about 4 or 5 years older!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Baker was not listed on 
the 1787 State Census of North Carolina in Wilkes County. Several other Bakers 
were listed in that county though (<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-1787nc.htm">which see</a>).
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Bakers lived with Thomas' 
uncle Martin Gambill for a few years right after they married (per Pension 
files). However they don't actually seem to be with them on the 1787 census. 
Martin Gambill was listed on that census in Wilkes in Capt. Nall's company 
(William Nall who was listed next door to him, and whose daughter Gambill had 
married). Gambill's household contained one male aged 21 to 60 (born between ca 
1727 and ca 1766). That would be Gambill himself. He also had two boys under 21 
(born ca 1766-1787), one of which could be&nbsp; Thomas Baker, but it doesn't 
quite fit. There was only one female in the house which was most likely Mrs. 
Gambill (Nancy Nall). <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-morris-ashe.htm">Morris Baker</a> was just 
two houses away. That suggests, but doesn't prove a relationship between the two 
Baker families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Baker is listed on the 
1790 census in
<a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/refs/nc/wilkes-nc.htm">Wilkes County</a>. He was in the 10th Company. There was one other Baker there, though 
not listed nearby, Ab. Baker (Abraham or Abram Baker). &nbsp;Thomas' uncle and 
foster-father Martin Gambill was also in that district.</font></p>

alphabetical, so I can't tell who Thomas' neighbors were, nor where he was 
living. For some reason, Thomas' household contained 4 adult males, I don't know 
who these were, whether relatives, or just boarders.&nbsp; His wife's age is way 
off here, but that is a typical census problem. There seem to be other problems 
with this listing as well as he had children in 1810 who should have been listed 
back in 1800 but weren't.</font></p>

<p>In the 1850's (through 1856) widow &quot;Molly&quot; Baker made several affidavits to 
get a Pension based on her late husband's Revolutionary War service. These are 
recorded in Pension File R-430. Mrs. Nancy Gambill, aged 94, widow of Martin 
Gambill also made a statement on her behalf in 1854.</p>
<p>I didn't find Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Cantrell Baker on the 1860 census. She probably 
died before then. </p>

      <p align="justify"><b><a name="children"></a>Children of Thomas Baker and 
      Mary Cantrell. </b>
      <font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Baker had lots of children per the 1790 
through 1830 census records. I have not identified any of them yet, though I 
suspect that <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-hiram-macon.htm">Hiram Baker (c1804)</a> is his son, 
but have no solid proof. In the Pension files it is mentioned the first two 
      children (a boy and a girl) died young, but that they raised a large 
      family. Unfortunately none of them were named. In Mary's last affidavit 
      (in 1856), a Mr. John W. Baldwin and a Mary Baker were witnesses. One 
      would assume they were related, but I don't know how. </font></p>
      <p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Widow Mary Cantrell Baker was living with 
      James and Jane (---) Ready in 1850. Jane was born ca 1824/25 per that 
      census and close to that per 1860. This doesn't match any of Thomas and 
      Mary's children per the census records. This suggests that Mary could be a 
      granddaughter or perhaps not even related. I'm listing Jane as a 
      grandchild of Thomas and Mary for now, just so I don't lose track of her.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I strongly <i>suspect</i> that 
this unknown son is <a href="http://www.martygrant.com/gen/baker/baker-hiram-macon.htm">Hiram Baker (c1804)</a>. My 
proof is all circumstantial:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram was near Thomas on the 
1830 census.</font></p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiram named his oldest son 
&quot;Thomas&quot;</font></p>

        <li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas did have an unidentified 
son this age per census analysis.</font></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">One flaw with the above is in
<a href="http://www.bakerdna.net/">DNA test results</a>. A descendant of Hiram 
Baker has taken the DNA test, and his results do <u>not</u> match those in the 
Thomas Baker (1711-1777) group. If Hiram was a son of Thomas (1765) his male 
Baker descendants should have nearly identical Y-Chromosome DNA results. In 
fact, as of this writing (04-17-2006) the Hiram Baker DNA results match no one 
else in the Baker DNA study.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">DNA test results seem to remove 
Thomas from being a candidate for Hiram's father. However, with just one test 
result we can't rule it out completely. There are always anomalies. If a second 
proven descendant of Hiram (from a different branch of his family) were to take 
the test and his results matched the others, then that would prove there is 
probably no anomaly.</font></p>

him.</font></p>
