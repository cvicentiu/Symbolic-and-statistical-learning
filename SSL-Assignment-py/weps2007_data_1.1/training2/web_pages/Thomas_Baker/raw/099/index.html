  biography is the first serious attempt to do justice to Thomas Baker McQuesten, 
  the Hamilton native who served as minister of highways and public works in Mitchell 
  F. Hepburn's controversial Liberal administrations at Queen's Park a half century 
  ago. And as the author, John C. Best, makes abundantly clear, there is considerable 
  justice to be done. But the question immediately arises: Why was McQuesten neglected 
  for so long? One could speculate that over the years his vindictiveness and 
  remoteness, among other flaws paraded out by an author who commendably points 
  to his subject's warts as well as to his more comely features, may have made 
  McQuesten a less than appetizing choice for the prospective biographer. He may 
  also have proved unpalatable because of his slavish backing of Hepburn, a political 
  leader whom many condemned as a crude charlatan and a moral fraud, a person 
  hardly fit to be supported by a scion of a leading Hamilton family noted for 
  its devotion to the finer aesthetic things of life. Again, it may simply have 
  been a matter of a Grit's being considered less than historically worthy and 
  politically correct in the heavy Tory atmosphere that prevailed in Ontario after 
  the Second World War. To add to McQuesten's liabilities, not only did he fail 
  to win the Liberal leadership after Hepburn withdrew from the scene, but his 
  own parliamentary career at Queen's Park came to an abrupt end in the 1945 elections 
  that produced George Drew's majority Conservative government. At least in the 
  political sense McQuesten ended up as an apparent loser, not exactly a front-burner 
  subject for the aspiring student of politics.<br>
  <br>
  Thankfully, none of this deterred Best, who has performed an important rescue 
  operation for McQuesten and, in the process, put together a good read, as one 
  might expect from a perceptive news executive who plies his trade at a local 
  television station. (I would put his book in the same league with Neil McKenty's 
  equally lively biography of Hepburn, which appeared a quarter-century ago.) 
  Best examines McQuesten's political career at both the local and provincial 
  levels, from his aldermanic responsibilities in Hamilton to the organization 
  of Liberal affairs in the city and the province, and final-ly to his elevation 
  to Hepburn's cabinet after the Grit sweep to power in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  The author is at pains to point out that politics for McQuesten was only a means 
  to an end, an opportunity to acquire the necessary authority and funding to 
  promote his many brain children, including the Queen Elizabeth Way that opened 
  in 1939. The highways minister, we are told, was disposed to overlook Hepburn's 
  many blemishes on the grounds that the premier constituted the only hope for 
  safeguarding Liberal fortunes in the province and hence for furnishing the necessary 
  springboard for McQuesten's own cherished projects to beautify the Ontario cityscape 
  and modernize its highway network. (Was he playing the role of a local Albert 
  Speer?) The argument, however, is only partially convincing. For all his gentility 
  and supposed aloofness from the political rough-and-tumble, McQuesten appears 
  to have entered fully into the in-fighting that frequently disfigured Liberal 
  affairs in Ontario and to have played a major role in the bargaining that led 
  to the selection of party officials and candidates. He also shared Hepburn's 
  cordial loathing for Mackenzie King, so much so that he saw to it that the prime 
  minister's name did not appear on a commemorative bell lodged in another of 
  his inspirations, the Rainbow Bridge carillon at Niagara Falls.<br>
  <br>
  In any case, there is no question that the most compelling sections of the book 
  do in fact deal with McQuesten's varied beautification schemes. He sought to 
  enhance urban approaches (like Hamilton's northwestern entrance) and to provide 
  ample and ornamental park space for blighted industrial communities. He also 
  oversaw the construction of an imaginatively landscaped version of an Autobahn 
  - the aforementioned QEW - chaired the work of the Niagara Parks Commission, 
  and inspired the planting of floral oases such as the Royal Botanical Gardens 
  in Hamilton. The last would not only provide splendid vistas for a citizenry 
  habitually starved of such amenities but ultimately a botanical laboratory for 
  major research. As Best demonstrates, McQuesten came by all this honestly. In 
  the early years of the century he had become infatuated with the international 
  City Beautiful movement and had welcomed ambitious urban planning schemes drafted 
  by outside experts such as Noulan Cauchon, all of which shaped his thinking 
  when he became head of Hamilton's Board of Park Management and later the minister 
  of highways.<br>
  <br>
  The author rightly gives full marks to McQuesten's strong commitment to parks 
  as arcadian retreats and environmental lungs, even if much of his imaginative 
  enterprise smacks of the patrician stooping to conquer. His otherwise laudable 
  schemes for the multitude might also have been an exercise in what passes for 
  social control, particularly in an age ravaged by a crippling depression and 
  stirred by unsettling ideologies of the left - always anathema to him and his 
  circle. Again, it is ironic, though typical of his class and generation, that 
  while the college-educated McQuesten played a vital role in locating McMaster 
  University in Hamilton - `the first break in a broader culture' for the city, 
  as he characteristically put it (58) - he was quick to suspect professors of 
  being in cahoots with dangerous revolutionaries bent on destroying the world 
  that he held dear. For McQuesten the latter included `On-to-Ottawa' hunger marchers 
  and those who instigated the bitter CIO strike at the General Motors plant in 
  Oshawa.<br>
  <br>
  This attractively designed and well-illustrated biography is not only readable 
  but scholarly. Family papers, a wide assortment of archival materials, and a 
  variety of newspapers, magazines, and printed memoirs have been assiduously 
  recruited and deployed to produce an enlightening piece of work. All the same, 
  some of the entries on secondary sources are too sparse (no chapter or page 
  references, for example), and there are some inexplicable bibliographical omissions: 
  to name but one, John Weaver's history of Hamilton, which could have provided 
  helpful and corrective insights. And when dealing with political matters Best 
  sometimes confuses an already complicated picture by failing to introduce properly 
  on first mention some of the leading players - for example, Harry C. Nixon (90), 
  who beat out McQuesten for the Grit leadership after Hepburn stepped down. More 
  seriously, he gives insufficient credit to the road-builders who came before 
  McQuesten, notably Wentworth's expansive agribusinessman, Frank Campbell Biggs, 
  who had served in E.C. Drury's ill-fated Farmers' government in the early 1920s.<br>
  <br>
  But these are comparatively minor criticisms of a welcome study that will clearly 
  benefit students of Ontario politics, urban enhancement, and regional history.<br>
