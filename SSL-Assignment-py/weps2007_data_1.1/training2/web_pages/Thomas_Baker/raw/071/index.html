<tt>At nineteen years of age in 1555, he met, fell in love with and married 
the daughter of a member of the Privy Council under <u><b>
<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutMary.htm">Queen Mary</a></b></u>, <b>Cicely Baker</b> of 
Kent. His father's exclusion from office under <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutMary.htm">Mary</a></b></u> did not significantly delay
<b>Thomas Sackville</b>'s entry upon public life for
it was not long after his coming of age that he sat in his first Parliament. His
election at the beginning of 1558 for East
Grinstead, where his father had wielded great influence, had the appearance of a
safeguard against his failing to carry off the knighthood for Westmoreland;
after he had done so and entered the House as junior knight for that shire, the vacancy
at East Grinstead was filled by another <b>Sackville</b> nominee, <b>Thomas Farnham</b>. The
circumstances of <b>Sackville</b>'s election for Westmoreland are not made easier of
explanation by the damaged state of the return, on which the surname is represented
only by the fragment 'sa...' A century ago the name was read as 'salkeld'. The 
accuracy of this reading is borne out by the appearance of that name, afterwards 
erased and replaced by 'sackvell', on one of the two remaining copies of the Crown 
Office list; the other and later copy has 'sackveld' alone. It is thus possible
that a <b>Thomas Salkeld</b>, presumably of the prominent Westmoreland family of that
name, was elected but was afterwards superseded by <b>Sackville</b>. What is more likely,
however, is that <b>Sackville</b> was elected and that instead of his unfamiliar name
its near counterpart was entered on the return, to be copied on the Crown Office
list and only corrected when <b>Sackville</b> appeared in the House. Who procured his
election is a matter of speculation. Neither he nor his fellow-knight <b>Anthony Kempe</b>, another Sussex man, had any standing in Westmoreland, but both could
claim a marriage connection with <b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/HenryClifford(2ECumberland).htm">Henry 
Clifford, 2º Earl of Cumberland</a></b>,
hereditary sheriff
of the county, and with his father-in-law the <b>3rd Lord Dacre of Gillesland</b>; 
<b>Cumberland</b> must also have had dealings with both <b>Sackville</b>'s father, and
ex-chancellor or augmentations, and his father-in-law <b>Sir John Baker</b>, one of
whom doubtless made
the approach. For <b>Sackville</b>, as for <b>Kempe</b>, a knighthood of the shire was not to
recur; he was to sit as a burgess in the first two Elizabethan Parliaments and
in the third he took his seat in the Lords. </tt>

<p><tt><b>Sackville</b> had appeared on the pardon roll in Oct 1553 as of London. On 8 
Mar 1557, together with <b>Thomas Swynton</b>, he purchased various properties in Kent 
and Sussex for £1,221. In co-operation with <b>Thomas Norton</b> he wrote &quot;The Tragedie 
of Gorboduc&quot; but he handed over his other literary project &quot;A myrroure for 
magistrates&quot; to <b>George Ferrers</b> and <b>William Baldwin</b> after completing the 'Introduction'.</tt><p><tt>

<p><tt>
      In addition during the year of 1561 he 
received the title of &quot;Grandmaster of the Order of Freemasons&quot;. In 1563 he was 
once again elected to Parliament this time for Aylesbury. When he became thirty 
one years of age, he was knighted and raised to peerage as <b>Lord Buckhurst</b> which 
did take place on the eighth day of Jun of that year. One year prior to 
receiving the title of <b>Lord Buckhurst</b>; <u><b>
<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">Queen Elizabeth</a></b></u> awarded a piece of 
property to keeping known as Knole.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Much of the fabric of Knole dates from the second half of the fifteenth 
century. On 30 Jun 1456 <b>William Fiennes</b> sold the estate £266 13s 4d to <b>
<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/ThomasBourchier.htm">Thomas 
Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury</a></b> (and for a brief period in 1455-6, Lord 
Chancellor of England). Between that date and his death in 1486, <b>Bourchier</b> built 
himself a substantial but relatively austere palace grouped around a series of 
courtyards, and containing all of the elements that one would expect to see in 
the house of an important medieval prelate - a great hall with a day parlour and 
first-floor solar at one end and kitchens and domestic offices at the other, a 
chapel, and lodgings for his large household.</tt></p>

<p><tt>When <b>Bourchier</b> died - at Knole - he left the estate to the See of 
Canterbury, and it functioned as an archiepiscopal palace until 1538, when <u>
<b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">Henry 
VIII</a></b></u> bullied <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/Latimer,Ridley,Cranmer.htm">Thomas Cranmer</a></b></u> into presenting it to the Crown. The
<u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">King</a></b></u> 
considerably enlarged the house by building three new ranges of lodgings and a 
turreted and crenellated gatehouse in the front of the <u><b>
<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/Latimer,Ridley,Cranmer.htm">Archbishop</a></b></u>'s original 
gatehouse, thus forming what is now known as the Green Court, the main entrance 
court at Knole. After his death, the house went through a rather confused series 
of occupancies. <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutEdward.htm">Edward VI</a></b></u> assigned it to
<u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/JohnDudley(1DNorthumberland).htm">John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland</a></b></u>, 
who for some reason returned it two years later. <u><b>

<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/ReginaldPole(Cardinal).htm">Cardinal 
Pole</a></b></u> for life in 1556; when he died in Nov 1558 (on the same day as the
<u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutMary.htm">Queen</a></b></u>) 
it reverted to the Crown. <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b></u> granted it to
<u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/JohnDudley(1DNorthumberland).htm">John Dudley</a></b></u>'s son, 
<u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RobertDudley(1ELeicester).htm">Robert, 
Earl of Leicester</a></b></u>, who promptly sublet it, before returning it, still sublet in 
1566. In Jun 1566 the <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">Queen</a></b></u> presented the estate to his keeping, under whom 
Knole has finally settled down to a more stable period of ownership. But throughout his career as one of her 
Majestys chief advisers, he had been unable to even live at Knole, in 
the stead he had managed replace the old Archbishop's palace with a Theobalds 
or a Holdenby for his <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">Queen</a></b></u>'s entertainment. Although he had been granted the 
house and estate in 1566, it currently occupied by the Lennard family, tenants 
who had moved in as the <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RobertDudley(1ELeicester).htm">Earl of Leicester</a></b></u> handed the property back to the Crown.</tt></p>
<p><tt>In 1568 he had been commissioned to traveled to France on an official visit,
his mission was to persuaded the <b>Queen Mother</b> to make a motion for the
marriage of <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b></u> with her second son, the
<b>Duke of Anjou</b>. In 1569 at
the age of thirty-three years old, he was honoured to be placed in the office of
Lord Lieutenant of Sussex. Two years later in 1571, he returned to France to
congratulate <b>Charles IX</b> on his marriage afterwhich he did return to England
bringing <b>Paul du Foix</b> along to continue the discussion of the impending
marriage. Also within that year he had been bestowed a Master of Arts from
Cambridge. In 1572, he became a member of her Majesty's Privy Council and became
employed as Commissioner at state trials.</tt></p>
<p><tt>As a member of <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutElizabeth.htm">her Majesty</a></b></u>'s
Privy Council, he was considered a protégée of <b><u>
<a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/WilliamCecil(1BBurghley).htm">William Cecil, Baron Burghley</a></u></b> and
he tends to agree with most of the issues <b><u>
