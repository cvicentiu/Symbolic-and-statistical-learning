<h3>Dublin Core Made Simple</h3>

<p><b>Dublin Core as a Language.</b> Dublin Core is often presented as
a modern form of <i>catalog card</i> -- a <i>set</i> of elements (and
now qualifiers) that describe resources in a complete <i>package</i>.
Sometimes it is proposed as an <i>exchange format</i> for sharing
records among multiple collections.  The founding principle that "every
element is optional and repeatable" reinforces the notion that a
<i>Dublin Core description</i> is to be taken as a whole.  This paper,
in contrast, is based on a much different premise:  Dublin Core is a
<b><i>language</i></b>. More precisely, it is a small language for
making a particular <b><i>class of statements</i></b> about resources.
Like natural languages, it has a vocabulary of word-like terms, the two
classes of which -- elements and qualifiers -- function within
statements like nouns and adjectives [<a href="10baker.html#note1">1</a>]; and it has a syntax for
arranging elements and qualifiers into statements according to a simple
pattern [<a href="10baker.html#note2">2</a>]. </p>

<p><b>A Pidgin for Digital Tourists.</b>  Whenever tourists order a
meal or ask directions in an unfamiliar language, considerate native
speakers will spontaneously limit themselves to basic words and simple
sentence patterns along the lines of "<b><i>I am</i></b> so-and-so" or
"<b><i>This is</i></b> such-and-such".  Linguists call this
pidginization.  In such situations, a small phrase book or translated
menu can be most helpful.  By analogy, today's Web has been called an
Internet Commons where users and information providers from a wide
range of scientific, commercial, and social domains present their
information in a variety of incompatible data models and description
languages.  In this context, Dublin Core presents itself as a metadata
pidgin for digital tourists who must find their way in this
linguistically diverse landscape.  Its vocabulary is small enough to
learn quickly, and its basic pattern is easily grasped.  It is
well-suited to serve as an auxiliary language for digital libraries.</p>

<p><b>This Grammar.</b> This grammar starts by defining terms.  It then
follows a 200-year-old tradition of English grammar teaching by
focusing on the structure of single statements (see the Reed and
Kellogg quote above).  It concludes by looking at the growing
dictionary of Dublin Core vocabulary terms -- its <i>registry</i>, and
at how statements can be used to build the metadata equivalent of
paragraphs and compositions -- the <i>application profile</i>.</p>

<h3>Elements and Qualifiers</h3>

<p><b>Vocabulary terms in general.</b> Strictly speaking, a Dublin Core
element or qualifier is a unique identifier formed by a name (e.g., 
title) prefixed by the URI of the namespace in which it is defined, as
in http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dces#title.  In this context, a namespace
is a vocabulary that has been formally published, usually on the Web;
it describes elements and qualifiers with natural-language labels,
definitions, and other relevant documentation.  Currently there are two
namespaces for Dublin Core: the Dublin Core element set and the Dublin
Core Qualifiers, denoted here by the conventional abbreviations dc: and
dcq:  [<A HREF="10baker.html#dcmi1999">DCMI 1999</A>, <A HREF="10baker.html#dcmi2000">DCMI
2000</A>].  In this paper, as in many application environments, the
elements and qualifiers are referred to in a machine-readable short
form, such as dc:title.</p>

<p><b>Elements.</b> The fifteen elements of the Dublin Core element set
are the defining feature of Dublin Core as a language.  In their short
form, the elements are dc:title, dc:creator, dc:subject,
dc:description, dc:publisher, dc:contributor, dc:date, dc:type,
dc:format, dc:identifier, dc:source, dc:language, dc:relation,
dc:coverage, and dc:rights.  These correspond to fifteen broadly
defined <i>properties</i> of resources that are generally useful for
searching across repositories in multiple domains.</p>

<p><b>Qualifiers.</b>  Qualifiers modify the properties of Dublin Core
statements by specifying, in the manner of natural-language adjectives,
"what kind" of subject, date, or relation.  Qualifiers currently fall
into two classes.  <i>Encoding schemes</i> are pointers to contextual
information or parsing rules that aid in the interpretation of an
element value.  For example, dcq:lcsh qualifies dc:subject to specify
that the keywords are a Library of Congress Subject Heading, and
dcq:iso8601 qualifies dc:date to specify that the string "2000-06-13"
is formatted according to an international standard.  <i>Element
refinements</i> make a property more specific without extending its
meaning, such as dcq:revised as a modifier of dc:date (yielding "date
revised").  In July 2000, a DCMI Usage Committee recommended a batch of
fifty-two qualifiers to exemplify these principles of qualification,
but the qualifiers for Dublin Core statements may also come from other
namespaces, as in the example yans:author below (where yans: is a
hypothetical YetAnotherNameSpace).</p>

<p><b>Elements and qualifiers defined in languages other than
English.</b> Strictly speaking, elements and qualifiers are represented
by machine-readable tokens that stand for general concepts such as
"title," "subject," and "date."  The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
discusses and approves their definitions in English.  In principle,
however, they can be labelled and defined equally well in any other
language, such as Dutch or Arabic or Thai.  For example, dc:creator may
be labeled "Creatore" in Italian, "Pencipta" in Bahasa Indonesian, or
"Verfasser" in German [<A HREF="10baker.html#baker">Baker 1998</A>].  To date, the
element set has been translated into twenty-six languages.  Bear in
mind as you read that although this grammar is written in English, a
Japanese version could translate every English word here into Japanese
-- all grammar terms and example sentences included -- <i>except</i>
for the English-like names of the tokens themselves.</p>

<h3>Dublin Core Statements</h3>

<p><b>Diagramming statements.</b>  Since the 1870s, the grammar of
sentences has been taught in (American) high schools using sentence
diagrams [<A HREF="10baker.html#reed">Reed and Kellogg 1886</A>, <A
HREF="10baker.html#house">House and Harman 1950</A>, <A HREF="10baker.html#warriner">Warriner
et al. 1973</A>].  This style has a binary flavor -- the sentence
baseline is intersected to divide the <i>subject</i>, "that of which
something is said," from the <i>predicate</i>, that which is said of
the subject.  Within the predicate, a smaller line separates the
<i>object</i> (in Dublin Core terms, the property) from the
<i>objective complement</i> (in Dublin Core, the property value).  This
style is nicely expressive of Dublin Core because the qualifiers,
hanging below the baseline on slanted lines, are visibly subordinate to
the properties they modify (see Figures 1 and 2).</p>

<P align=center><IMG src="dc_fig1.gif"></P>  
<P align=center><A name=dc_fig1.gif></A>
<B>Figure 1: The general pattern</B></P>  

<p><b>Parts of a Statement.</b> Dublin Core is in effect a class of
statements of the pattern "Resource has property X," where "resource"
is the implied subject; followed by an implied verb ("has"); followed
by one of fifteen properties from the Dublin Core element set; followed
by a property value -- an appropriate literal such as a person's name,
a date, some words, or a URL.  For example: "Resource has dc:creator
'Tom Baker'," and "Resource has dc:date '2000-06-13'." Optional
qualifiers may make the meaning of a property more definite, as in
"Resource has dc:date dcq:revised '2000-06-13'."</p>

<p><b>Principles of Qualification.</b>  The qualification of Dublin
Core properties is guided by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb-Down
Principle.  According to this rule, "a client should be able to ignore
any qualifier and use the description as if it were unqualified.  While
this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element
value (minus the qualifier) must continue to be generally correct and
useful for discovery" [<A HREF="10baker.html#dcmi2000">DCMI 2000</A>].
Qualification is therefore supposed only to refine, not extend the
semantic scope of a property.  In borderline cases, qualification
should not result in a literal that could be misleading.</p>

<p><b>Appropriate Literals.</b> Whether a property value is "useful for
discovery" is at the heart of the notion of appropriateness.  A
property value should be a string of an expected type -- usually, for
example, some sort of name for dc:creator, dc:contributor,
dc:publisher, or dc:title; a URL for dc:relation, dc:identifier,
or dc:source; full-text sentences for dc:description; short
text strings or keywords for dc:subject, dc:type, dc:format,
and dc:language; and a recognizable combination of years,
months, and days for dc:date.  Both in theory and in
practice, the range of expected data types varies from property to
property; which types are appropriate for a given property is open to
interpretation and debate (see below).</p>

<p><b>Evaluating Statements.</b> To test whether a Dublin Core
statement is conceptually solid, cover the qualifiers with your hand
("dumbing down"), read the statement above the line, and ask:</p>

    <ul><li>Does it make sense?
    <li>Is it factually and logically correct?
    <li>Is the literal "appropriate" for the given property?</ul>

<B>Figure 2: Some statements, diagrammed</B></P>

    Resource has dc:title 'A Grammar of Dublin Core.'

        <blockquote>
        Does it make sense?  Yes.  Is it correct?  Yes.  Is the literal
        "appropriate"?  Yes, a sequence of words is normal and expected
        for the property dc:title.
        </blockquote>

    Resource has dcq:iso8601 dcq:revised dc:date '2000-06-13.'
        
        <blockquote>
        This means that a resource was revised on 6
        June 2000.  The statement dumbs down to "Resource has
        dc:date '2000-06-13'," which means that the
        date 6 June 2000 has something to do with the
        life-cycle of the resource.  This is less specific
        than the qualified statement, but still correct.
        </blockquote>

    Resource has dcq:lcsh dc:subject 'Languages -- Grammar.'

        <blockquote>
        This says that the resource is about the subject "grammar of languages,"
        and that these words are a controlled term
        from the Library of Congress Subject Headings.
        The statement dumbs down to "Resource has dc:subject
        'Languages -- Grammar'," which makes sense even if we 
        do not know that the term comes from the Library of Congress.
        </blockquote>

    Resource has yans:cerif dc:subject 'H352 Grammar, semantics,
    semiotics, syntax.'

        <blockquote>
        This literal includes a language-independent
        abbreviation, "H352," which will be useful for
        applications that understand yans:cerif.  The string
		"H352" may confuse some users, but otherwise does no harm.
        </blockquote>

    Resource has yans:author dc:creator 'Tom Baker.'

        <blockquote>
        Users of the yans: 
        namespace will recognize that yans:author is
        being used here as an adjective modifying dc:creator
        (just as <i>talk</i> is an adjective modifying
        <i>show</i> in the phrase <i>talk show</i>).  It is
        an awkward but correct way to say that Tom Baker is
        "the author sort of creator" -- i.e., the author -- 
        of the resource.  This statement dumbs down to "Resource has
        dc:creator 'Tom Baker'," -- less specific but 
        still correct.
        </blockquote>

    Resource has dc:relation 'http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december98/12baker.html.'

        <blockquote>
        The statement asserts that the resource is somehow
        related to an article in <em>D-Lib Magazine</em> 
        (a URL is appropriate as a literal for
        dc:relation).
        </blockquote>

<h3>Some not-so-good examples</h3>

    Resource has dc:creator 'name.given:Thomas; name.family:Baker;
    employer:GMD; contact:Schloss Birlinghoven, D-53754 Sankt Augustin.'

        <blockquote>
		A reader can see what this <i>compound</i> or
		<i>structured value</i> is saying.  But a search engine
		would need to know how to parse out the components and
		suppress the tags in order to index this cleanly, lest
		a search for creators named "Augustin" should yield
		false hits.  Generally speaking, things like
		affiliations and addresses -- properties <i>of the
		creator</i> of a resource -- do not belong in Dublin
		Core statements about the resource itself.  Metadata
		providers that used such compound values within
		specific usage communities could "speak Dublin Core"
		to the rest of the world by exporting just the name
		("Resource has dc:creator 'Thomas Baker'").
        </blockquote> 

    Resource has yans:creator 'Tom Baker.'

        <blockquote>
        This statement is useful for applications that
        recognize the yans: namespace, but it is not a
        "Dublin Core" statement per se.  If the yans:
        and dc: definitions of Creator were
        compatible, either the metadata provider or an
        indexing application could use a crosswalk to 
        translate this into the
        Dublin Core statement "Resource has dc:creator
        'Tom Baker'."
        </blockquote>

<h3>Ongoing Issues</h3>

<p><b>Fifteen fuzzy buckets.</b>  The properties of Dublin Core are
like fifteen big buckets, and the rules about which types of literals
may be placed in those buckets are somewhat fuzzy.  This fuzziness is
intentional -- the Internet is a diverse and chaotic place where a more
disciplined, top-down approach to standardization is unrealistic,
especially for use across multiple domains and languages.  If
the rules of Dublin Core were more precise, people would inevitably
bend them.  In the jargon of computer science, then, Dublin Core is
"weakly typed" as a language.  A search engine may find a variety of
information types in any given bucket -- from URLs to non-textual,
alphanumeric strings to full text in any language.</p>

<p><b>The "appropriateness" of literals.</b> Requirements for the
appropriateness of a literal are in practice somewhat contradictory.
Ideally, a literal should be useful for discovery, which means it
should make sense "as is" to the average user. Yet it should also be
processable in an expected way by search engines.  Programmers need to
be know, for example, when to index on strings separated by white
space, minus punctuation and stop words, when to expect a URL, and when
to expect an alphanumeric date string.  Some elements are particularly
ambiguous in this regard.  Dc:rights, for example, can be free
text or a URL.  Dc:coverage can be a place name, the name of a
time period, a numeric identifier for a place or time, or even a
compound value -- in effect, a miniature schema with multiple
sub-components separated by semicolons or XML tags.  Where such a range
of data types is permissible, should it be acceptable to relax the
Dumb-Down Principle?  Should qualifiers in effect modify the expected
data type of the literal?  Or should the presence of, say, XML angle
brackets be expected to trigger, automatically, a change in parsing
algorithms?  Would such a complexification of a property compensate for
the corresponding loss of Dublin Core's overall simplicity?  Or can the
need for complex description be resolved in a broader framework, outside
Dublin Core per se?</p>

<p><b>Application profiles.</b>  One broader framework for such a resolution is the <i>application profile</i>.  As currently defined, application profiles are the metadata equivalent of regional idioms or creoles (complexified pidgins). Implementors who need an
application language more expressive than a pidgin may combine elements
and qualifiers from Dublin Core with elements from other namespaces
into a richer vocabulary or embed them into a syntactically more
sophisticated data model.  Such linguistic innovation is considered by
many people to be reasonable as long as implementors respect a
distinction between namespaces, where elements and qualifiers are given
standard definitions, and profiles, where elements from multiple
namespaces are (only) reused, combined, adapted, and constrained [<A
HREF="10baker.html#heery">Heery 2000</A>].  The profile, then, is the natural locus
for full descriptions -- the catalog card or metadata package taken as
a whole.</p>

<p><b>For example,</b> the Collection Description Schema of the
Research Support Libraries Programme (RSLP) in the UK uses dc:title --
officially defined as a "name given to the resource" -- but defines it
more narrowly as a "name given <i>to the collection</i>."  Alongside
such Dublin Core elements, it uses elements from other namespaces, such
as cld:accessConditions (for the hours of access and classes of
permitted users) from a local "Collection Level Description"
namespace.  These elements are framed in a data model that specifies
typical relationships between a collection, its individual items, a
collector, an owner, a location, and the constituent parts of a
collection -- each of which may be described with multiple attributes
[<A HREF="10baker.html#rslp">RSLP</A>].  An RSLP description does not talk just
about information resources per se, but also about the people,
organizations, and access frameworks related to those resources.</p>

<p><b>Developing profiles and coining new elements.</b> Some working
groups of DCMI are developing domain-specific profiles of Dublin Core,
surveying the descriptive needs of domains such as education and
government to determine an appropriate mix of Dublin Core elements and
elements from other namespaces and perhaps to coin additional elements for
concepts not covered in existing standards.  These working groups need
to consider that literals appropriate to domain specialists may not
make much sense to general users, especially in statements that have
been "dumbed down." As the example above makes clear, moreover, core
elements are needed for classes of resources other than document-like
objects, such as people and organizations (generically, <i>agents</i>)
and spatially and temporally grounded <i>events</i>.  Urgently required
are data-model conventions for combining multiple entities within an
application profile -- for example, to include an author's affiliation
and address in the description for a resource -- and stable formats for
the encoding of profiles as XML or RDF schemas.</p>

<p><b>Building a dictionary (registry) for Dublin Core.</b>
Historically, the standardization of national languages such as
English has been helped by the compilation of dictionaries. Good dictionaries often strike a balance between <I>pre</I>scribing
guidelines for good style and <I>de</I>scribing a living language with examples of actual usage.  Metadata languages like Dublin Core have hitherto been
developed prescriptively, in standards committees, as there have been
no convenient ways to track local innovations in usage and feed them
back into the standardization process.  However, several related
developments are now enabling the collective construction of metadata
dictionaries, or registries. The new Resource Description Framework
(RDF) Schemas standard of the World Wide Web Consortium provides a
format for publishing schemas that can be harvested by metadata search
engines [<A HREF="10baker.html#w3c2000">W3C 2000</A>].  Eric Miller has developed
an open-source software toolkit for indexing a distributed corpus of
RDF schemas as one huge database, with an interface for following
hyperlinked cross-references between related terms in namespaces and
profiles -- in effect, a metadata schema browser 
[<A HREF="10baker.html#eor">EOR</A>].  The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is using
this toolkit to manage its namespace [<A href="10baker.html#open">Open Metadata Registry</a>], and a working
group is formulating technical and policy guidelines for its ongoing
management [<A HREF="10baker.html#dc-registry">DC-Registry</A>].
A European project, SCHEMAS, is promoting the use of RDF
schemas to help harmonize metadata practice among EU-funded projects
and is using RDF to build a layer of annotated pointers to namespaces,
profiles, and metadata activities generally 
[<A HREF="10baker.html#schemas">SCHEMAS</A>].</p>

<p><b>Does your application speak Dublin Core?</b> Pidgins are
inherently limited in what they can express, but they are easy to learn
and enormously useful.  In real life, we talk one way to our
professional colleagues and another way to visitors from other
cultures.  Our digital library applications need to do this as well.
Simplicity and complexity are both appropriate, depending on context.
If Dublin Core is too simple or generic to use as the native idiom of a particular application, pidgin statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms that exist for specialized domains. This output should also be filtered to keep the fifteen buckets clear of encoding debris and semantic silt.  One should treat
digital tourists with courtesy and hide from them the complexities
of a local application vocabulary or grammar.  However sophisticated
its local idiom may be, an application might also speak a pidgin that general users and generic search engines will understand.  Simple, semantically clean, computationally obvious values will help us negotiate our way through a splendidly diverse and heterogeneous Internet.</p>

<h3>Appendix: Dublin Core and RDF grammar compared</h3>

<p class="smallfont"><b>Directed Labelled Graphs.</b>  The Resource Description Framework
(RDF), a relatively new standard of the World Wide Web Consortium, is
emerging as an information model and encoding format of choice for
metadata and application profiles that use Dublin Core [<A
HREF="10baker.html#w3c1999">W3C 1999</A>, <A HREF="10baker.html#w3c2000">W3C 2000</A>].  RDF is
a grammar for expressing relationships among resources located or
represented somewhere on the Internet.  These relationships are
depicted graphically with Directed Labelled Graphs (DLGs), which use
arcs (predicates expressing properties) to establish a relationship
between multiple nodes (resources).  Nodes are seen as subjects or
objects depending on the direction of the arrow.</p>

<P align=center class="smallfont"><A name=dc_fig4.gif></A>
<B>Figure 3: The general pattern of RDF statements ("triples")</B></P>  

<p class="smallfont"><b>RDF triples.</b>  In contrast to the binary flavor of the
pedagogical English grammars cited above, the model of RDF statements
is a tripartite one of <i>subject</i>, <i>predicate</i>, and
<i>object</i> (see Figure 3).  RDF statements, accordingly, are called
"triples":</p>
 
    <blockquote class="smallfont">
   A <i>property</i> is a specific aspect, characteristic,
    attribute, or relation used to describe a resource. ...  A
    specific resource together with the named property plus the
    value of that property for that resource is an RDF
    <i>statement</i>.  These three individual parts of a statement
    are called, respectively, the <i>subject</i>, the
    <i>predicate</i>, and the <i>object</i>.  The object of a
    statement (i.e., the property value) can be another resource or
    it can be a literal; i.e., a resource (specified by a URI) or a
    simple string or other primitive datatype defined by XML.  In
    RDF terms, a <i>literal</i> may have content that is XML markup
    but is not further evaluated by the RDF processor [<A
    HREF="10baker.html#w3c1999">W3C 1999</A>].
    </blockquote>

"http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila," predicate "has creator," and object

 <p class="smallfont"> <b>Subject of an RDF statement.</b>  The subject of an RDF statement
is anything that can be named by a Universal Resource Identifier
(URI).  In principle, this is anything from a Web page or museum
artifact to an abstract concept or event.  The subject of a Dublin Core
statement, in contrast, is an anonymous "information resource," perhaps a
"document-like object" [<a href="10baker.html#note3">3</a>].  In Dublin Core, the subject ("resource")
is always implied, never named as in RDF.  The RDF statement in Figure
4, then, would be expressed in Dublin Core as two statements:
"Resource has dc:identifier 'http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila'," and
"Resource has dc:creator 'Ora Lassila'."  As long as it is clear from
the context that the two statements refer to the same resource -- for
instance, they are both in the same record -- one can infer that Ora
Lassila has created the Web page [<a href="10baker.html#note4">4</a>].

 <p align=center class="smallfont"><B>Figure 5: Grammar Terms Compared</B></P>

 <p class="smallfont"> <b>Predicate of an RDF statement.</b>  The predicate of an RDF
statement is an implied verb plus a property.  This is more restricted
than the standard definition of a predicate in high-school English
grammar, which includes (in effect) "everything to the right of the
vertical intersector in a sentence diagram" -- that is, everything
within a clause that is said about a subject.  However, since most
people have only the vaguest recollection of predicates from high
school, this grammar avoids using the term at all.</p>

 <p class="smallfont"><b>Property value of RDF statements.</b>  In RDF, these are called
<i>objects</i>.  But again, there is risk of confusion with English
grammar.  In the sentence "This paper has the title 'A Grammar of
Dublin Core'," some high-school English grammars see 'A Grammar of
Dublin Core' as an <i>objective complement</i> with respect to the
<i>object</i> of the sentence, "title" (see Figure 5). Compounding the
confusion, computer scientists are oriented to <i>objects</i> of a much
different sort, and the "resource" of a Dublin Core statement might
even be a physical <i>object</i>.  This grammar avoids the
term <i>object</i> altogether.</p>

 <p class="smallfont"> <b>The lack of qualifiers in RDF.</b>  In Dublin Core, qualifiers
depend on and modify one of Dublin Core's fifteen elements
(properties).  The basic RDF model does not express this type of
dependency.  Properties may relate to another as narrower to broader
terms (using the relation "SubPropertyOf"), as "Author" relates to
"Creator." In native RDF, however, both "Author" and "Creator" are full
properties in their own right.</p>

 <p class="smallfont"> <b>The compatibility of Dublin Core and RDF.</b> The differences
between Dublin Core and RDF outlined above are largely terminological;
at issue is what the parts of a statement such as 'Resource has
Property X' should be called.  The difficulty of choosing the right
words for this grammar should not obscure the basic compatibility and
complementarity of Dublin Core and RDF.  RDF offers a general model for
statements, while Dublin Core offers a particular type of pidgin-like
statement about information resources and privileges a small set of
special words.  RDF offers a specific encoding in XML for expressing
its conceptual model, while Dublin Core is by design independent of any
particular encoding format.  RDF, then, is just one of the possible
information models that can use tokens from Dublin Core, while Dublin
Core is just one of the languages expressible in RDF.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<A name="note1"> </a>
<p class="smallfont">[1] It would be desirable to have a word for Dublin Core vocabulary
terms in general -- elements and qualifiers as a whole -- just as
natural-language nouns, verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions are all
called <i>words</i>. Unfortunately, <i>entities</i>, <i>concepts</i>,
and <i>symbols</i> are all too abstract and vague; <i>words</i> are
associated too closely with natural language; and <i>lexemes</i> are
too obscure.  The first draft of this paper spoke generically of
<i>elements</i> and distinguished between <i>core elements</i> and
<i>qualifiers</i>, but veterans of Dublin Core found this confusing.
The next draft introduced <i>tokens</i>, which conveys the notion that
Dublin Core vocabulary terms stand for general concepts that are
defined and labeled in many natural languages, but people also found
this confusing.  <i>Vocabulary terms</i> seems a bit cumbersome, so I
avoid the term whenever possible and speak simply of <i>elements and
qualifiers</i>.</p>

<A name="note2"> </a>
 <p class="smallfont">[2] Early in the workshop series, before it was formally called a
Metadata Initiative, the Dublin Core effort was declared to be
primarily about <i>semantics</i> in contrast to <i>syntax</i>, and the
latter was declared to be out of scope.  In that context, however,
<i>syntax</i> referred to the encoding of metadata in HTML, database,
and (later) XML or RDF formats; it involved questions such as which
tags to place where, within what angle brackets or punctuation, and how
to group or nest related elements.  This grammar, in contrast, presents
the <i>syntax</i> of Dublin Core statements in a linguistic sense, as
the rules governing how the words of a sentence are related to each
other -- which words modify other words, and which words are of central
importance in the statement.</p>

<A name="note3"> </a>
 <p class="smallfont">[3] In practice, the reasoning behind this is circular: Dublin Core
properties are appropriate for any entity that has such properties.
This circularity has spared us a perhaps futile attempt to seek
philosophical consensus on a universal ontology of entity classes and
allowed us to get on with the task of describing whatever it is we are
describing.</p>

<A name="note4"> </a>
 <p class="smallfont">[4] Dan Brickley points out that software tools could exploit
additional information about entities and vocabularies to translate
sequences of RDF-encoded Dublin Core statements into a natural-language
style that flows more elegantly and reads less like a pidgin.</p>

<p class="smallfont"><em>      The following four changes and corrections were made at the request of the author, Thomas Baker, on 10/17/00): 1.) In the  paragraph "Does your application speak Dublin Core?" one phrase was changed from: "its elements can be embedded in a richer local vocabulary from which pidgin statements can be generated or extracted as needed." to read "pidgin statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms that exist for
 specialized domains." 2.) The name Linda Hill was added to the 
 "Acknowledgements" section. 3.) In the paragraph "Vocabulary terms in general", "(e.g., Title)" was changed to "(e.g., title)." 4.) In the commentary of the first of the "Not-so-good examples," the sentence "Resource has dc:creator 'Tom Baker'" was changed to: "Resource has dc:creator 'Thomas Baker'".
