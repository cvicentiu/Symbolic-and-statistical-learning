<P><FONT COLOR="#8F8F8F" SIZE=+3>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>he Columbus Museum
is paying tribute to the artistic achievements of Georgia natives Alma Thomas
(1891-1978) and Lamar Baker (1908-1994) in the exhibition <I>Two Columbus
Legacies</I>. The exhibit, on view in the Museum's Shorter-Leebern Gallery
from November 14, 2004 to February 27, 2005, features approximately 100
prints, drawings and paintings by the two artists that are drawn from the
Columbus Museum's extensive holdings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thomas' vibrant abstractions came to international prominence
in 1972 when she became the first African-American woman to be awarded a
solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Although influenced
by earlier modern masters such as Matisse and Picasso, her work was perhaps
more shaped by her fascination with the optical effects of pure color and
with natural forms-especially flowers. Baker achieved national recognition
for his socially and politically-charged prints, many of which depict African-American
life in the South. The artist's images reflect his keen interest in gospel
music as well as folk art and surrealism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A special <A HREF="http://www.columbusmuseum.com/twolegacies/">website</A>
for this exhibition has been developed. The site, which includes details
about the artists, images, family activities and information for educators
and students, can be accessed at a computer kiosk in the exhibition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker were two exceptional artists
who experienced firsthand the dramatic changes in the American art world
during much of the twentieth century. Both were Southerners who established
successful careers in major art centers in the North. Both became involved
in art movements of national importance and drew their inspiration from
direct observations of contemporary life. Both have ties to Columbus --
the city was Thomas' birthplace and the place in which the Atlanta-born
Baker spent much of his later life. Beyond these few similarities, however,
the two artists pursued remarkably different paths. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Alma Thomas was a woman of color who escaped racial prejudices
in the South by moving to Washington, DC, where she eventually became a
prominent abstract painter. Thomas rejected the notion of painting stereotypically
&quot;black&quot; subjects and instead embraced modernism in her quest to
develop a universal language of color and form. The primary inspiration
for the artist's luminous abstractions was the natural beauty she sought
in outdoor settings, especially flower gardens. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although white, Lamar Baker made regular trips from his
studio in New York City to Atlanta, where he depicted with great </FONT><IMG SRC=
"2cm243.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=+1>conviction and detail
such topics as political corruption, social injustice, poverty and, above
all, the difficult circumstances of African American life in the South --
the same factors that had driven Alma Thomas to leave Columbus as a teenager
in 1907. In fact, influential curator and critic Carl Zigrosser once referred
to him as &quot;one of the first native artists to reckon with the problems
of the new South.&quot; Unlike Thomas, Baker employed a clear, narrative
style, remained highly suspicious of avant garde art movements, and produced
his most inspired work early in his career between 1935 and 1945. Alma Thomas,
however, was a fiercely modern artist who did not reach her full potential
as an artist until age 68 -- after she retired from teaching and devoted
her full-time energies to painting. </FONT>(right: Lamar Baker,<I> Self-Portrait

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Featuring nearly 100 objects, <I>Two Legacies </I>celebrates
the Columbus Museum's extensive holdings by Thomas and Baker, and focuses
special attention on their works on paper. Both artists considered paper
an important and versatile support material for their artistic creations
in a variety of media. For Thomas, watercolor and gouache were principal
modes of experimentation and she relished the watery washes of translucent
color as well as the dense, controlled color shapes that these media afforded.
Baker created numerous drawings and watercolors, but produced much of his
most compelling and inspired work in the form of lithographic prints (made
by drawing in greasy crayon on a fine grained stone that is moistened with
water, rubbed with an oily ink that adheres to the dry waxy marks only,
and then run through a press). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This exhibition represents the first time the bulk of the
Columbus Museum's holdings by the two artists have been shown, and the first
time they have been presented together. The Museum is grateful to the late
Miss John Maurice Thomas and the family of Alma Thomas for its important
gift of what certainly stands as one of the largest collections of Thomas's
works on paper. In addition, the Museum acknowledges the generosity of Lamar
Baker, who bequeathed the prints, paintings and drawings in what now represents
the most extensive body of Baker's work in existence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This exhibit is sponsored by generous funding from the
Fifth Generation Foundation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Saturday, February 12, from 2:30-4:30 p.m., visitors
may view films about African-American artists, including <I>Alma Thomas:
A Life in Art</I>. This free program is open to all ages. </FONT></P>
