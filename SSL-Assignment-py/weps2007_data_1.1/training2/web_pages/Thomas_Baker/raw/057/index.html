Mr. Baker died in 1835, leaving his widow and three sons. The sons bought a tract of land in Colerain township, on which Thomas Baker was located, the mother remaining in Chester county, where she died in 1853. Thomas was the eldest child; Lewis, the second son, married Mary Greenfield, and located on a farm near the old homestead in Chester county, where he died in 1846 leaving a widow, who still lives on the old home, Robert A. died when a young man.<br />
Thomas Baker was well educated in the public schools of Chester county, and for twenty years was a teacher in the public schools of Lancaster and Chester counties, pursuing that profession long after his marriage. In 1840 he commenced to study surveying, preparing for that work under Jonathan Goss, at Unionville Academy, Chester county, and it has been his main occupation during most of his active life. He has surveyed over 650 farms in Lancaster and Chester counties, as welll as land in Virginia, and made his best survey in 1902, when almost eighty years of age.<br />
Thomas Baker was married in June, 1855, to Miss Eliza, daughter of James and Abigail Jackson, prominent residents of Lancaster county. Mrs Baker was born in Chester county, in May 1834, and was for a number of years a teacher in Lancaster county. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Baker began married life on a farm in Colerain township, where he erected a brick house and a frame barn. There they remained until 1879, when the present handsome brick house on one quarter of the farm was built, in which they have since resided. He is leading a quiet and retired life, doing, however, some little tasks in surveying. His son Lewis has charge of the farm. Mrs. Baker, while on a visit to her son in Philadelphia, in 1893, took cold, and died in that city, her husband and four children, out of a family of seven born to them, surviving: (1) Abbie, born in 1856, married Howard Brinton, a farmer of Colerain township, and died leaving two sons, Thomas B. and Lewis B.

He has one son, Richard Veryl, who was born in April, 1897.<br />
Thomas Baker has always been a Republican. He has never aspired to political station, though he was once elected school director in Colerain township, when it was strongly Democratic. He and his family are devout adherents to the Quaker faith, to which their ancestors have been committed. Mr. Baker and his wife took a trip to Europe, visiting England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and all of the German states, spending much time in many places of interest. Thomas Baker is a man esteemed by his neighbors for his many good qualities and excellent charcter, and in disposition he is a man of warm heart and kindly feeling. He is a man of considerable learning, and is a Latin and French scholar. While in England he purchased a book published (in Latin), which he prizes very highly.<br />
