<HR><P><FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3>In 1979 Dorothy Merrifield wrote a book entitled "A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family." This book is no longer in print; therefore, for the benefit of descendants of Moses Baker in their quest to find information on this family, I will attempt to include a small part of the book on this web page.  The book is 183 pages long and I am in possession of photocopies of only a portion of this book.  The book is no longer in print.   If you have any information to add to the information below, please contact me at CMElaine@aol.com  Thanks!  Elaine Powell<BR>
<BR>
The introduction of the book reads as follows……..<BR>
<BR>
Much has been written about the early Bakers of Nansemond, Isle of Wight and Surry Counties, Virginia and of Gates, Chowan and Bertie Counties, North Carolina.<BR>
<BR>
John Bennett Boddie in his books: "Southside Virginia Families", Vol. 1, "Virginia Historical Genealogies" and "Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County, Virginia" has devoted many pages to the families of Lawrence and Henry Baker.<BR>
<BR>
Bodie suggest that the Bakers were from Sussex and Kent, England and that they first settled in Virginia in the early seventeenth century.  Lawrence Baker was granted land in Surry County, Virginia in 1650.  He was a member of the House of Burgesses from 1666 to 1676.  He died in 1681 and left his estate to his widow Elizabeth and his daughter Catherine, who was the wife of Arthur Allen.  (Boddie SS p 5).<BR>
<BR>
A Henry Baker was also a resident of Surry and he patented land in 1683.  He died in 1700, leaving his estate to his wife Sarah and his children.  His daughters were:  Rebecca, Mary, Susan and Elizabeth.  His sons were:  Henry, Edward and William. <BR>
<BR>
Boddie doesn't attempt to establish a proven relationship between Lawrence Baker and Henry Baker, but it is very likely that they were either brothers or father and son. (Ibid).<BR>
<BR>
Boddie continues with the family of Henry Baker of Isle of Wight County, Virginia.  He suggests that Henry of Isle of Wight may have been the son of Henry who died in Surry County, Virginia in 1700.  Boddie believed that Mary Baker (Henry's wife) was a daughter of John Blake of Nansemond County, Virginia, but in the year 1914, Ex-Judge B. B. Winborne, a descendant of Henry Baker, wrote an article about this family which was published in the 1968 summer issue of the "North Carolina Genealogy", pp 2114-2134, and it was his belief that Henry Baker married Mary Bennett, one of the daughters of Edward Bennett of Isle of Wight County, Virginia.  Edward Bennett had another daughter named Sylvester or Sylvestra who married Major Nicholas Hill.  <BR>
<BR>
Henry Baker was a wealthy merchant and when he died in 1712 he left a large estate to his wife and children.  The names of his children were:  Henry, James, Lawrence, William, Sarah, Mary, Catherine and Elizabeth.  The land that he devised to his sons Henry, William and Lawrence fell within the boundaries of Chowan Precinct, North Carolina and when Hertford County was established their lands were within the boundaries of Hertford County, North Carolina.  (NCG pp 2114-2123, 1969).<BR>
<BR>
For more information about this early and very interesting family the reader is referred to the books mentioned below.  <BR>
<BR>
This book is about the family of Moses Baker. <BR>
<BR>
A Moses Baker died in Isle of Wight County, Virginia prior to 1693.  His widow Elizabeth married Edward Riddle.  Moses Baker had at least one son, Moses Baker Jr.  In 1693, Moses Baker Jr. sued his stepfather, Edward Riddle, for the estate that his father Moses Baker Sr. had devised to him in his last Will and Testament.  A few months later Edward and Elizabeth Riddle died and letters of administration were granted to Samuel Rollyson who had married Hannah Baker, one of Elizabeth's daughters.  An attachment was awarded to Moses Baker Jr. against Samuel Rollyson for many valuable articles, which had belonged to Moses Baker Sr.  In one of his declarations, Moses Baker Jr. stated that he was the godson of Colonel John Powell and he also sued to recover the property devised to him by the last Will and Testament of Colonel Powell.  (Boddie IW p245 and VHG p 98).<BR>
<BR>
The next reference to Moses Baker was his marriage to Elizabeth Brown on January 12, 1694 in Elizabeth City, Virginia.  Thirty years later he died.  His Will is recorded in Chowan County, North Carolina.  He left a wife, three sons and three daughters.  The following is an excerpt from his Will.<BR>
<BR>
"….Being very sick and weak in body but of perfect mind and memory…..I bequeath unto my well beloved wife all my estate during her natural life or widowhood only….to my three daughters, the cattal  which are called theirs at the day of marrige….to my son Moses, my niegar fallows….to my son Benett my gun and belt….to my son William one cow and cow calf at the age of 15, also a bed….the rest of my estate to be divided after my debts are paid….my friend Richard Minshen and my wife my whole and sole executors….."  Wit: Aaron Blanchard, Jurat, William Hill and William (x) Wesson, Jurat. Chowan January Court 1724.  (NCA WB 1 p 85).<BR>
<BR>
Please keep in mind the names of the witnesses to Moses Baker's Will.  Notice that Moses Baker named his second son Benett. As stated on the beginning page of this introduction, Mary Bennett married Henry Baker and Mary's sister Sylvester Bennett married Major Nicholas Hill.  A Moses Hill died very early in Chowan County, North Carolina and left a Will, but it was said to be illegible. (Grimes p 105).<BR>
<BR>
William Weston, who was one of the witnesses to Moses Baker's Will was married to Catherine Blanchard, daughter of Benjamin Blanchard.  An excerpt from the Will of Benjamin Blanchard follows.<BR>
<BR>
Upper part of Nansemond County.  June 5, 1719.  Benjamin Blanchard.  Sons:  Robert ("Land on Beverdam Swamp in Chowan Precinct, N.C.") Absalom…….Benjamin ("Land on Beverdam").  Son-in-law:  William Weston (wife Catherine).  Executors:  Wife Catherine and son Robert.  Wits:  William Hill, James Grising, Thomas Roundtree.  (Grimes p 33).<BR>
<BR>
William Hill, also a witness to Moses Baker's Will, married Mary Spivey, a daughter of Thomas Spivey.  William Weston and Robert Blanchard witnessed Spevey's Will.  Mark Chapel was a legatee of Thomas Spivey.  (Grimes p 356).<BR>
<BR>
A Richard Hill, died and left a Will  in Craven County, North Carolina in 1729.  His heirs were:  Daughter, Ann Jones; son-in-law, Evan Jones; granddaughter, Elizabeth Hill.  Exr:  Brother, Francis Hill.  (Grimes p 165).<BR>
<BR>
On page four of this book please note that Margaret (14), daughter of Michael (2) Baker, married a man named Evan Jones.  This Evan Jones was no doubt a grandson or grandnephew of the Evan Jones mentioned in the Will of Richard Hill. <BR>
<BR>
In 1735, Moses Baker was the executor of the Will of Richard Chappell.  It is assumed that this Moses Baker was the son mentioned in the Will of the Moses Baker who died in Chowan County, North Carolina in 1724.  An Excerpt from the Will of Richard Chappell follows.<BR>
<BR>
Chowan County, N.C. March 1734.  Pro. Oct. 1735.  Richad Chappel's Will suggests a close family relationship.  He may have been the brother of Eliza Chappell.  We know that Moses Baker married Elizabeth Brown in 1694 in Elizabeth City, Virginia and that he died in 1724 in Chowan County, mentioning three unnamed daughters in his Will.  Eliza may have been one of those. Richard Chappell named his eldest son, Moses, probably after Moses Baker.  Since Richard Chappell didn't appoint his son Moses as his executor, it may be that he wasn't of legal age. <BR>
<BR>
Below are abstracts of two deeds involving Moses and Bennett Baker.  <BR>
<BR>
DB C p 193.  Bertie Co., N.C.  Jan. 31, 1748.  Moses Baker, Yeoman, sold to Benjamin Holleman 150 acres for 30 pounds, land on the east side of Chinkapin Creek, adjoining John Smith at Flatt Swamp and Kellum.  Wits:  John Wynns, John Smith, W. Evens.  May Ct. 1749.<BR>
<BR>
BD C p 399.  Bertie Co., N.C.  May 22, 1751. John Smith, yeoman, sold to Bennett Baker, miller, 200 acres for 30 pounds on the East side of Chinkapin Swamp adjoining "land of James Holley bequeathed to Jane, his wife, by the last Will and Testament of our father John Smith, Deceased".  Adjoining James Williams.  Wits"  John Wynns, John Freeman, Thomas Parker.  (Bell pp200 and 216).<BR>
<BR>
These two deeds prove that Moses and Bennett Baker, sons of Moses Baker of Chowan County, North Carolina, owned land adjacent to each other on Chinkapin Creek in Bertie County which later was in Hertford County when that County was organised.  They lived in the same County as Henry and Lawrence Baker and were neighbors to James Williams.  <BR>
<BR>
Moses Bake sold his land and moved to Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  In 1759 he witnessed the Will of George Williams.  An excerpt of that Will follows.<BR>
<BR>
Edgecombe Co., N.C. July 19, 1758.  Pro. June 1759.  Will of George Williams.  Sons:  George, Samuel. Dau:  Cloe.  Dec'd sister, Lucretia Williams.  Extrix:  Wife Priscilla.  Wit:  George Crudup, Moses Baker and John Norwood.  (Grimes p 409).<BR>
<BR>
Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County, North Carolina in 1786 and who was the progenitor of our family, named his eldest son, Michael, perhaps after Michael Brinkley who witnessed the Will of Richard Chappell.  He named his second son, Aaron, after Aaron Blanchard who witnessed the Will of Moses Baker who died in 1724 in Chowan County.  His fourth son, Thomas, married Penelope Williams who was the daughter of Thomas and Margaret Williams.  Thomas and Margaret Williams also had a daughter named Priscilla.  She may have been named after the wife of George Williams.  (Watson, N.C. Estate Records, 1730-1820).<BR>
<BR>
All through the genealogy that follows you will find the names of Smith, Williams and Jones, the same family names associated with Moses Baker in Bertie and Edgecombe Counties, North Carolina. <BR>
<BR>
Although Henry Baker and Lawrence Baker lived in the same general area as Moses Baker in Chowan, Bertie and Hertford Counties of North Carolina, I have not found any evidence that they were related unless the relationship occurred in the early 1600's in Nansemond and Isle of Wight Counties Virginia.  There seems to be no similarities of names carried on by the two families. <BR>
<BR>
Although I believe that Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County, North Carolina is a descendant of Moses Baker who died in Chowan County, North Carolina in 1724, despite all of the evidence, however interesting, I have been unable to prove a direct relationship.  Therefore, I begin "A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family, 1708-1979" with Moses Baker of Edgecombe County, North Carolina. <BR>

<BR>
MOSES BAKER was born ca 1708, probably in Virginia and he died in 1786 in Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  He wife's name was Sarah and on October 24, 1786 she testified in Court that she had received her share of her deceased husband's estate from Jesse Baker, the executor.  (BD 4 p 559).<BR>
<BR>
Moses Baker had formerly lived in Bertie County, North Carolina on Chinquapin Creek (sometimes called Chinkapin).  His brother, Bennett Baker, lived next door.  Chinquapin Creek was a branch of the Chowan River, which was the dividing line between Bertie and Chowan Counties.  When Hertford County was formed in 1854, Chinquapin Creek was in that County.  Other Bakers living in the area were:  William Baker and his two sons, William Jr. and James; Benjamin Baker, Henry Baker and Blake Baker. (Bell pp 76, 155, 179, 200, 216, 223).<BR>
<BR>
Moses sold his land in Bertie County in 1748 and he moved to Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  SOMETIME BETWEEN 1750 AND 1757, MOSES BAKER AND HIS SON, MOSES BAKER JR., SERVED IN THE MILITIA IN THE COMPANY COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN SOLOMON ALSTON.  Captain Alston's Company guarded the soother area of Edgecombe County that later was cut off to form the northeast part of Wilson County in 1855.  (Hugh Johnston).<BR>
<BR>
In 1777, Meady Bozeman deeded one acre of land to the Protestant Ana-Baptist Church on Town Creek.  Town Creek branched off of Swamp Creek, a branch of the Tar River.  Moses Baker was a member and a trustee of the church.  Other trustees were:  Miles Scarbory, John Stokes, William Scarbory and James Scarbory.  Witnesses to the deed were:  Malachi Mounts and Jesse Drake. (DB 3 p 285, Edge. Co., N.C.)<BR>
<BR>
I have estimated the birthdates of Moses Baker and his children in this way.  Michael Baker, the eldest son of Moses Baker, died in 1776, and he was the father of ten living children.  Two of his sons were of legal age when he died, as he appointed them executors of his Will.  That means that they were born before 1753-55.  Subtract twenty-one years from 1753 and we have the approximate date of Michael's birth, which would be about 1732-34.  Thomas Baker, the fourth son of Moses Baker, was married January 1, 1763, to Penelope Williams.  If he was twenty-one years old or older, when he married, then he would have been born about 1740-42.  Jesse Baker, the youngest son of Moses, was married and the father of four sons when his father died in 1786.  His eldest son was born in 1777.  That would place Jesse Baker's birthdate about 1753-55.<BR>
