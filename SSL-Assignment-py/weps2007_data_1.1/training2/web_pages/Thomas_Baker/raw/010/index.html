						<br>
						</b>I wanted to sincerely thank all of you for being 
						part of my School Board campaign. What started as a long 
						shot became one of the most hotly contested races in 
						town. Our positive message and vision for the future of 
						the schools and city was embraced by many of the voters 
						we came into contact with. We set out to make history in 
						this election and while we came up a bit short, I am so 
						proud to have been your candidate!<br>
