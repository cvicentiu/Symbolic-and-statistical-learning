<h3>Getting Ahead in the Digital World</h3>
Response to Gregory Crane<br>
By Catherine E. Rudder, Executive Director<br>
American Political Science Association
<p>
March 26, 1999
<P>
Gregory Crane is clearly a pioneer in the digital revolution.  He early on saw the potential of electronic databases and took professional risks to develop his own expertise and to pursue digital projects.  I'm sure that his fellow classicists were puzzled, in fact, by his what must have at the time seemed to be a highly unconventional interest.  Gregory Crane's example should make us hesitate to say that humanists are behind the technological curve.  To use his own analogy he's not going to strike out with the bat on his shoulders.  His past prescience should impel us to pay close attention to his current swings and thinking.  What does he tell us?
<p>
We have only just begun to explore the new information technology, but there are barriers that must be surmounted if we are to realize the full possibilities of this technology for teaching and research.  This technology has the ability to transform the very research enterprise, not to mention how and what we teach.  The intellectual connections we can make are greatly expanded by technology.  However, we are inhibited by our standard ways of thinking about publication, tenure and promotion, content, and limits.  We are used to thinking in terms of a world of limits set by what can be presented in two dimensions on the printed page when the multidimensional universe has been opened before us.
  
It is no revelation that peer reviewed work can be equally presented digitally or in print.  We in political science have the peer reviewed Political Methodology journal to prove it, as do other societies have such journals.  But, as we all know, human change comes much more slowly than the technological kind.  As one result, we haven't adjusted our notions of what counts for tenure.  Must an article be in print form to have legitimacy?  Eventually, laggard human organizations will catch up with the technology.  But more intractable problems loom.  I'd put them in three categories: Credit, resources, and imagination.
<p>
First, what credit should be given for technical work in an area that does not lead to extending or developing theory, does not test hypotheses, does not produce new insights?  Here I am referring specifically to those scholars who spend their time developing innovative web-based courses or those who create new electronic databases.  This is not a new problem brought on exclusively by digital possibilities.  It is an old one: How much does and should teaching count in tenure and promotion?  What technical work should be regarded with respect and rewarded?  In my view, only the extraordinary person will be rewarded in an academic sense for technical work in developing courses and research platforms if the university continues to be organized as it currently is.  Where innovators of this sort - especially in the teaching arena--will be recognized is by for-profit companies and entrepreneurial universities who need such people to develop courses in distance learning and the like.  These practitioners may also be rewarded in the traditional university but as technicians, not scholars.  
<p>
Gregory Crane treats learning about technology essentially as an add-on and suggests that young scholars might spend an extra year in graduate school to learn the essential skills and help exploit the possibilities of the technology.  But I would suggest that spending yet another year in graduate school is exactly against the trend and, further, that there are only so many hours in the day.  Scholarship in the traditional sense - thinking seriously about hard intellectual problems - takes up most of those hours for most people.
<p>
Second, not to belabor the obvious, but we have all learned that to harness the potential of this digital revolution is very, very expensive.  Not only does it not save us money, it is a constant, never-ending drain on our resources and has required that we make very difficult, painful choices: trimming and even eliminating activities and acquisitions that until now have been considered essential, and in turn exacerbating already difficult budgetary problems that we all face. This is just as true for the scholarly societies as for the research libraries.  Even when a foundation contributes a major investment to help start a project, ongoing funds must be found to keep the project going.  And often electronic provision takes away revenue streams and doesn't add to them.
<p>
Third, perhaps Gregory Crane's strongest challenge to us, his audience, is that we must assiduously and conscientiously work to rid ourselves of the print model lest it stand in the way of our discovering the marvelous new possibilities that the digital world has in store for us.  We will be able to change the very research questions that we ask and pursue vastly different and more complicated research projects.  But we seem interminably stuck in the print groove.  How do we escape our limited outlooks?  By experimenting, by investing in risky projects - something the research librarians have not only advocated since the beginning but have practiced.  My personal hope is that those of us engaged in the scholarly enterprise will be committed to working together and not let the exigencies of budgets or the divisions created by misunderstanding or superficial differences stand in our way of our ability to  "carpe diem."
