Armed with winged sandals, a magic sword, and a cap of invisibility, 
Perseus set off on a quest to slay the Gorgon Medusa, a monstrous woman whose 
head was encircled by writhing snakes.
<P>
The Perseus project at Tufts University is a digital library that provides its 
users with the winged sandals of technology to aid them in their pursuit of 
knowledge. The project is named after the hero from Greek mythology, says Editor 
in Chief Gregory Crane, because he wanted a character "who reflected going out 
into the greater world of gods and monsters." 
<P>
Designed for the general public as well as students and scholars, Perseus can be 
accessed by CD-ROM or on the Internet at www.perseus.tufts.edu. "Perseus is like 
a library that belongs to all of us, to students and faculty and to scholars and 
students who are not affiliated with any university," says Laura Gibbs, assistant 
professor of classics and letters at the University of Oklahoma. "And it is open 
twenty-four hours a day." 
<P>
Containing more than thirty thousand images and five million words of text, the 
Perseus project offers a number of innovative tools that change the way students 
approach ancient languages, literature, and archaeology. Users can read English 
translations of the plays of Euripides, the poetry of Homer, or the history of 
Thucydides. Students of Greek and Latin are able to "flip" back and forth from 
the original text to the English translation, reinforcing their understanding of 
the ancient languages. "Perseus has allowed people to look at more and different 
kinds of primary materials," Crane says. "People can use the texts even if they 
don't know the languages very well. And the project has vastly increased access 
to visual information." Viewers interested in sculpture, for example, can see 
large, color photos--sometimes even twenty or more shots of the same object--taken 
from different angles.
<P>
In addition to advanced search tools, the Perseus staff has developed browsing 
tools to orient the reader within a document. The navigation bar, the horizontal 
equivalent of the elevator bar, indicates the reader's location at the top of the 
screen. "This gives people the sense of place they have with a physical artifact," 
says Crane. "Although we can't mimic the heft of a book in your hand, we're not far 
from flipping through pages."
<P>
Since its inception in 1992, Perseus has kept pace with changes in computer 
technology, expanding the ways in which a library gives access to information. "By 
integrating visual and textual information, we're solving the very concrete 
problem of materials being physically far from each other," says Crane. 
<P>
A person interested in the character of Medusa from the Perseus myth, for example, 
may go to a library and look up "Medusa" in an encyclopedia. The encyclopedia 
entry might contain unfamiliar terms or references to other books, resulting in a 
good deal of legwork within a library or between several libraries. 
<P>
Perseus simplifies the process. A user who types the word "Medusa" into the 
Perseus search engine elicits the following list of information available on the 
website: three coins, twenty images, five Perseus encyclopedia entries, six 
sculptures, four source citations, and twenty-four vases. Visual and textual, and 
literary, historical, artistic, and archaeological materials are all cross-referenced 
together, making them easy to locate. Clicking on the topic "encyclopedia entries" 
leads to a list of online texts that includes authors such Apollodorus, who wrote 
<i>Library and Epitome</i>, the only extant chronological narrative of Perseus's 
life. 
<P>
But when a user opens <i>Library and Epitome</i>, Apollodorus's words do not simply 
appear on the computer screen--because it is hyperlinked, the text acts as a 
portal to other resources. Clicking on an unfamiliar term in the story brings up a 
lexicon window explaining the term; choosing "plot sites in this book" generates 
an interactive map of the locations mentioned in Apollodorus's book; and clicking 
on a footnote calls up a reference to scholarly commentary or another ancient text.
 In this case, Apollodorus's tale is linked to Ovid's blow-by-blow account of 
Perseus's battle with Medusa: 
<P>
<i>As the swift bird of Jove, when he beholds a basking serpent in an open field,
exposing to the sun its mottled back, and seizes on its tail; lest it shall turn
to strike with venomed fang, he fixes fast his grasping talons in the scaly neck;
so did [Perseus,] the winged youth, in rapid flight through yielding elements, 
press down on the great monster's back, and thrust his sword, sheer to the hilt,
in its right shoulder--loud its frightful torture sounded over the waves--</i>
<P>
Crane got the idea for the Perseus project when he was a graduate student in 
classics at Harvard University. "I had access to the best university library in 
the world," Crane recalls. "It had gotten me accustomed to making connections 
between documents, in the traditional sense of tracking down footnotes and running 
around the library. I realized that not everyone could do that and even there, at 
this excellent library, it didn't work very well. I got interested in information 
retrieval and it became clear that we could put everything--text and pictures--in 
a digital library." With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, 
Crane has continued to add to Perseus's content and refine its capabilities. With 
the tools Perseus has developed over the past year, users can now steer through 
one million documents in the time that it took to navigate one hundred documents. 
More than one hundred thousand browsers take advantage of this enhancement each 
weekday. 
<P>
Writing in 1998 about computer technology, Crane explained that the ultimate goal 
for humanists ought to be to "make accessible, both physically and intellectually, 
to every human being on this planet, the complete record of humanity." Even 
though their area of study is far removed from modern times, classicists have been 
in the forefront of efforts to bring the humanities into the computer age. In part, 
this is due to the relatively few resources available to classicists. Because 
extant texts and objects from the ancient world are limited, classicists have 
always been interested in examining their sources in creative ways.  
<P>
In addition to learning to use computer technology for the study of classics, the 
staff of Perseus has dealt with other computer-age issues such as copyright law 
and the dissemination of information over the Internet. To protect the rights to 
the texts and objects, some of Perseus's content is only available on CD-ROM. 
Another way that Perseus protects its contributors' property is that the website 
itself is formatted to prevent full texts and images from being downloaded. In 
this way, Perseus is able to provide its users with an enormous amount of 
information, securely, around the clock.
<P>
The Perseus website calls itself "an evolving digital library," referring to its 
continually increasing selection of offerings. Originally containing information 
about ancient Greece, Perseus's topics have expanded as a result of an NEH/NSF 
digital demonstration grant to comprise Rome, ancient science, the nineteenth-century 
City of London, and the complete works of Christopher Marlowe. By the end of 2000, 
Perseus will house more materials from the English Renaissance, including the 
complete works of William Shakespeare, and soon Perseus's content will expand 
further to include text and images about ancient Egypt and the American Civil War.
<P>
Integrating technology into the study of classics permits scholars not only to 
search databases more rapidly and thoroughly, but to discover unexpected 
correspondences between information. "We're trying to take a time-based view and 
provide both geographic coverage and temporal coverage," says Crane. "There is a 
relentless pressure to compartmentalize research. Perseus opens the door for more 
comparative studies."
<P>
Students of many disciplines are using the Perseus project as a guide through the 
vast maze of information about the ancient world, much like Theseus, who threaded 
a ball of string behind him as he wandered the labyrinth in search of the Minotaur.
<P>
Randy Hoyt, a junior at the University of Oklahoma, says his interest in classical 
culture and computer technology was sparked by the Perseus project. A philosophy 
major with limited formal training in Greek and Latin, Hoyt uses the Perseus 
morphological tool to read the ancient philosophers in their original language. 
Perseus inspired him to create his own website on the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, 
and to plan a reading group to study Plato's <i>Dialogs</i> with some fellow 
students. "I know everyone will benefit from wrestling with the Greek and with the 
philosophy and that all our minds together--with Perseus as a major tool and 
resource--can figure out what's going on in any particular passage," Hoyt says.
<P>
"My students and I use Perseus as we would use the library, if it were accessible 
instantly from our desks," says Christopher Blackwell, assistant professor of 
Greek at Furman University. "They love it. The study of classics is an extended 
process of looking things up again and again until you remember them. Perseus 
takes a lot of the hassle out of that, and not only allows, but encourages students 
to investigate broadly and deeply."
