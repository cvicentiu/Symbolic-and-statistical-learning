This replaces the NSDL Communications Portal (http://comm.nsdlib.org) including email list services, interactive web spaces, and documents. Services at the web site were converted from a private SourceForge license to the Open Source GForge software. This upgrade continues support for a software development environment for NSDL projects and also provide backend software for the new community section being developed for NSDL.org.  Thanks to Elly Cramer, Dean Eckstrom, Dean Krafft, and Alex Chaux for making this important change in a timely and professional manner.

Crane holds a professorship in the Department of Classics at Tufts as well as the Winnick Family Chair in Technology and Entrepreneuship. His association with the well known Perseus Project began in 1986 and since 1988 he has been Editor-in- Chief.<br /><br />
In an interview with First Monday he said:<br />
"When I became an assistant professor in 1985, I collaborated with some other classicists to start work on what would become the Perseus Projec At the time, we had a dim sense of what a heterogeneous digital library might look like. We wanted to link every category of data that we used in print form in an electronic environment and then to see what would happen."
<br /><br />
Perseus has gone well beyond print and has become one of the most successful and well used digital libraries. Greg Crane is a man whose honors and recognition span the distance from the Lowell Prize for Excellence in Greek in 1977 to the 2001 Vannevar Bush Award for Best Paper at JCDL. He has much to tell about the ways in which digital libraries are the cognitive tools of the educational and intellectual world.<br />Related Link:  <a href="http://nsdl.org">http://nsdl.org</a></div>
