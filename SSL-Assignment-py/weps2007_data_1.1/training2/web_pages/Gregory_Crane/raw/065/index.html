<h3> Review Essay: Robert McNamara and the Peloponnesian War</h3>
<p>Gregory Crane
Tufts University
<p>It is difficult for students of Thucydides -- some of us anyway -- to avoid
drawing comparisons between his work and the memoirs of other former
military leaders, both more and less successful.  Such comparisons are not
entirely serendipitous, for Thucydides did much to shape that quasi-historical
genre of European literature in which retired statesmen and ex-generals have
followed. Those with a taste for nineteenth century American history may
compare the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant[1] or, less read, but even more
brilliant, those of William Tecumseh Sherman (a very Thucydidean figure). [2]
Those more keen on British history may prefer <i>The World Crisis</i>,
Churchill's account of the First World War.  Many such memoirs could be cited,
but the past year has introduced one particular volume that invites a striking (if
not very flattering) comparison with Thucydides.  Those of us who grew up in
the United States during the latter half of twentieth century can be grateful that
we have had no personal experience of a Civil War or First World War, but the
War in Vietnam, although it was fought far away from North America and
although it did not obliterate an entire generation (of Americans), deeply
shocked the settled assumptions and values of its time in such a way as to invite
comparison with the American Civil War, World War I and even the
Peloponnesian War.  Thus, I found it hard not to read Robert McNamara, ghost
writer and all, with an eye to Thucydides and that tortured Greek prose which a
modern ghost writer would have flattened and undone.  Few will be surprised, I
suspect, if I find the comparison lopsided, and I see no point in castigating
McNamara for failed to match a Great Man of the past, but the comparison is
nevertheless instructive.  Thucydides -- still trotted out in many courses,
histories and anthologies as the progenitor of political realism[3] -- has much in
common with his distant intellectual descendent who directed US policy in
Vietnam.   But, if Thucydides invented realism, the case studies in his history
also showed more clearly the limitations of this realism than the Harvard
Business School case studies did for McNamara.  
<p>In reading Robert McNamara's memoirs about the Vietnam war, two things
particularly struck me.  First, despite his many self-serving remarks and
disingenuous proofs of personal honesty, I was impressed with the degree to
which McNamara had thought through his mistakes:  McNamara's memoirs
cannot, for example, compete with the extended (and, in its own way, arguably
disingenuous) confessional intensity which Albert Speer projects in his <i>Inside
the Third Reich</i>,[4] but then the Johnson administration, whatever its faults,
was no Third Reich.
<p>But if the soul searching and admissions of error advertized for this book were
indeed present, my second reaction was very different.  I was dismayed at the
conclusions which McNamara had drawn from his experience.  Early in his
account, he reproaches himself because neither he nor Dean Rusk performed an
adequate analysis -- all well and good.  What follows, however, is more
problematic, for McNamara blithely remarks that "we failed to ask the five most
basic questions" about the topic.[5] It does not matter what those questions were
-- they seem reasonable enough. What matters is the easy assurance with which
McNamara identifies what these precise five questions are -- five, not six or
four, and phrased "just so" in his best corporate briefing style.  Where
McNamara thought he was admitting error, he revealed that he had had learned
almost nothing.  The problems, as he sees it, were tactics or procedures:  if he
had just been able to tick off the right checklist of questions in 1961, he could
have helped the United States avoid the worst of the Vietnam mess.  After
several hundred pages of bullet marked lists and executive summaries, all in
pre-digested prose polished by Brian VanDeMark, this breezily repentent
narrative reaches its conclusion:  a section on the "eleven major causes for our
disaster in Vietnam,"[6] all neatly laid out in the conclusion for the busy
decision maker to scan.
<p>The results seem so neat, the questions raised so simple.  Thucydides has his
own executive summary passages in which he expresses his conclusions:  he
publishes case studies about early Greek history (Thuc. 1.2-19), the plague at
Athens (Thuc. 2.47-54), and the civil war at Corcyra (Thuc. 3.69-85).  Where
McNamara provides his bulleted lists or his eleven causes, Thucydides also has
a predilection for distilling his conclusions:  he offers the primary cause of the
Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 1.23.6) and, in his overview of Perikles, endorses his
strategy in the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 2.65.6-13).  Thucydides speaks
self-consciously about the methodological problems that confront an historian
(Thuc. 1.20-22), and his goal was to "write up," in the most transparent possible
language, what really happened (Thuc. 1.22.2).[7] He was not a Sophokles who
revelled in ambiguity, but an analyst who would, I think, have loved to write
with the self-assurance of a McNamara.  Thucydides, who wrote most of his
own history while in exile from Athens, established the literary tradition which
McNamara followed:  the retrospective analysis of the leader who had fallen
from favor. 
<p>Nevertheless, Thucydides may have striven for clarity and for simple answers,
but he was too keen an observer to smooth out his narrative so as to fit neatly
with any of his theories.  Despite the occasional explicit conclusions that he
draws (e.g. 2.65) and despite the fact that his narrative is remarkable for the
critical elements that it marginalizes,[8] Thucydides narrative generally invites,
rather than precludes, analysis.  The final capture and destruction of Plataia fits
into its natural chronological slot, but it also consitutes one piece in the
carefully wrought structure of book three:  the Spartan capture of Plataia follows
almost immediately after the Athenian capture of Mytilene, and the narrative
ostentatiously invites us to compare the Athenian decision to spare (most of) the
Mytileneans with the Spartan resolve to execute all their Plataian prisoners. 
Thucydides tells us explicitly why he believed that the Spartans made this
decision (they needed the Thebans:  Thuc. 3.68.4), but, although his disdain for
the pretensions of Spartan virtue are clear in episodes such as Melos, he does
not explicitly moralize or allows us to draw our own conclusions from the
contrast between the Athenians at Mytilene and the Spartans at Plataia.  Earlier
in the book, he follows the idealizing Funeral Oration of Perikles with his
devastating account of the plague -- the reader cannot help but compare the
grand vision enunciated by Perikles with the harsh limits of human nature
brought out by the plague. The plague, however, soon gives way to Perikles'
final speech that recognizes the plague but defends, in heroic terms, the course
of action that the statesman had sketched from the beginning (see Thuc.
1.140-144).  When Thucydides goes on at Thuc. 2.65 to endorse Perikles'
leadership, his narrative provides us with the materials to undercut Thucydides'
own judgment.  While Thucydides as analyst strove to resolve ambiguity and to
provide a perfect account for decision makers of later generations (e.g. Thuc.
1.22.4), Thucydides as observer unflinchingly recorded events whether or not
they supported his explicit theories.
<p>Contrast McNamara's memoirs.  He takes himself and his colleagues to task for
their ignorance of the culture and values of the Vietnamese.  Certainly, this is an
enormous step forward:  Dean Acheson's generally lucid memoirs, especially
where they touch upon American relations with China and the Korean War,
suggest that only the most superficial understanding of local cultures and
histories contributed to American policy during the decade following the second
World War.[9] Nevertheless, the improvement is limited:  his weakness,
McNamara states, was simply that he did not have enough experts at his side. 
McNamara remains the same technocrat that he had always been.  His brief
introductory section describes how his Harvard Business School managerial
skills allowed him to serve his country during the Second World War -- he even
includes a photograph of himself receiving a medal from a five star general for
his work.  Although he never heard a shot fired in anger and his greatest risk
was the hazardous air travel of the day,[10] his contribution to the war effort
was important -- Albert Speer, who directed the war effort of the competition
was arguably worth as much as any fighting general.  Nevertheless, McNamara
betrays no sensitivity to the ambiguous position in which this placed him, when,
twenty years later, he sent eighteen year old boys to die in the jungles of
Southeast Asia for a cause in which he no longer believed.  (Abraham Lincoln,
by contrast, had no illusions about his own brief and bloodless participation in
the Black Hawk Indian War.  The fact that old men had not sent him in harm's
way rendered his responsibilities a generation later during the Civil War all the
more heavy and earned more than one young soldier convicted of cowardice --
"leg men," he called them -- a presidential reprieve from execution.)  The fury
which veterans and widows of Vietnam have, since the publication of his book,
directed at this personally decent man has reportedly shocked him.  Similarly,
McNamara understands how his own loyalties to Henry Ford II, to Kennedy and
then to Johnson contributed both to his rise in power and to the mistakes that he
made, but his analytical tools seem unable to deal with such intangibles in the
making of policy.  In the end, McNamara enjoyed an honorable second (or,
perhaps counting his time at Ford, third) career, spending more than a decade as
the Head of the World Bank, but this task seems to have suited him far better
than the analysis of dedicated or venal human beings.
<p>McNamara in his memoirs frequently admits that Vietnam admitted of no simple
solutions, but he nevertheless sounds often as if, if he knew then what he knows
now, he could have avoided the catastrophes of the past.  While I also believe
that American policy was mistaken, McNamara seemed to have replaced one set
of certainties for another:  we do not, in fact, know what would have happened
if the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had let South Vietnam go under ten
years earlier than it did.  Many of us believe that this would have been
preferable, but we cannot know this for sure and we must always, as a part of
our responsibility as students of the past, keep firmly in our minds the risks
inherent in any course of action.  The Thucydidean Perikles, in fact, opens his
first speech by reminding the Athenians that human resolve, strong at first, often
wavers in the crush of events (Thuc. 1.140).  When the plague breaks out and
savages Athens,where refugees from the countryside packed the city,
exacerabating the dubious sanitation conditions and contributing to the plague,
what would McNamara have done?  I cannot help but think that his memoirs of
the Peloponnesian War would have argued that the war had been a mistake and
that Athens should have maintained its accomodation with Sparta. While this
may well be true, the clarity of hindsight -- the production of easy, "eleven
point" lessons -- would have reduced the value of such a memoir for future
leaders, trapped in the shadows and ambiguities of the present.
<p>Whatever his moral judgments, McNamara would understood the pervasive
<i>Realpolitik</i> of Thucydides' Athenians and the brutal questions which the
Spartans posed to each of the doomed Plataians (Thuc. 3.53.2, 68.1:  "Have you
or have you not helped Sparta in the present war?").  But I am far from
confident about how deeply he would have understood the arguments of the
Plataians and Melians or the ambiguities which lay behind the positions of all
those involved.  Archidamos' numbers and McNamara's bullet lists and outline
can only capture so much.  For the rest, there are no easy answers.  Reading
Thucydides is no panacea, but the tortured fifth-century account of the Greek
world war, with its contradictions and irresolved tensions, has as much to say
now as it ever has.

<p>[2] Sherman's memoirs contain a striking parallel to the Melian dialogue, which
illustrates the play of similarities and differences of that total war which the
Athenians on Melos and Sherman in Georgia each espoused:  Crane, 1997
compares the realisms of Thucydides and Sherman;  see, for example, Sherman's
"Athenian" correspondence with John Bell Hood's "Melian" position at Sherman,
1984 2.119-125.
<p>[3] Thucydidean scholarship has reacted against this, documenting at length the
degree to which Thucydides does not fit the cold, calculating role to which he is
often assigned:  see, for example, Connor, 1984 and Orwin, 1994; Thucydides'
"realism" is a major theme of Crane, 1997.

<p>[8] Thucydides minimizes the importance of Greek religion as a factor in events
(e.g. Hornblower, 1992) and the marginal role that he assigns to women in his
narrative is famous (women show up roughly one tenth as often in Thucydides
as in Herodotus:  e.g. Dewald, 1981, Harvey, 1985, Wiedemann, 1983,
Cartledge, 1993).  The topics that Thucydides pushes to the margins of his
history are the main subject of Crane, 1996.
