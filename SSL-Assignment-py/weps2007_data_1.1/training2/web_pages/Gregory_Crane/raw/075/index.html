                22, 2001</small><p><font size="4"><b>Crammers Settle FTC Charges</b></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>&quot;Rebate&quot; Checks Sent To Consumers Were
                Contracts When They Were Cashed</i></b></font>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><font size="3">Operators who used bogus &quot;rebate&quot; checks to deceive consumers
                into signing up for Internet yellow pages directory and Internet service have agreed to
                settle Federal Trade Commission charges that their operations were deceptive and violated
                federal law. The settlements will bar the deceptive practices in the future; require clear
                and conspicuous disclosure that by depositing a check a consumer is agreeing to sign up
                for the service; and provide consumer refunds.</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">In June 2000, the FTC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District
                of Arizona, against Mesa-based YP.Net; Telco Billing, Inc.; Publication Management Inc.;
                and individual defendants Gregory B. Crane, William D. O'Neal, Michael K. Bloomquist and
                Joseph T. Carlsen. At the FTC's request, the court issued a temporary restraining order,
                froze the defendants' assets and appointed a receiver to oversee the businesses, pending
                trial. The FTC alleged that the defendants sent checks for $3.50 marked &quot;REBATE
                ACCOUNT&quot; to consumers all over the country. Nothing on the front of the check alerted
                consumers that, by cashing the check, they were agreeing to purchase the Internet yellow
                page listing at the rate of $19.95 per month for a year, or that the charge would
                automatically be placed on their telephone bill. Only a notice printed on the inside of
                the envelope spelled out the terms and conditions of the agreement. The FTC charged that
                failure to disclose clearly and conspicuously that the check represented agreement to sign
                up for their services was deceptive and violated the FTC Act. The settlements announced
                today will end the court action.</font>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><font size="3">The settlements will bar misrepresentations that consumers can obtain
                rebates without incurring any obligation and that defendants have an ongoing business
                relationship with consumers. The settlements also will bar the defendants from using the
                term &quot;rebate&quot; on solicitation checks. YP.Net, TBI, PMI, Gregory Crane and
                William O'Neal also are required by their settlements to clearly and conspicuously
                disclose the obligations consumers will incur in cashing solicitation checks and will be
                required to send notices to consumers to confirm service and billing agreements and to
                give them the opportunity to cancel. In addition, they are required to give consumers who
                signed-up for their services between April 1, 2000 and July 14, 2000 the option of a two
                month refund. All the settlements contain record keeping provisions to allow the agency to
                monitor compliance.</font>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><font size="3">In the course of preparing for trial, the FTC identified a related
                company, Simple.Net, engaged in a similar marketing scheme. The company marketed Internet
                access services using &quot;rebate&quot; checks. A stipulated final judgment and order for
                permanent injunction filed with the court would bar their misrepresentations of rebates
                and require them to send customers who signed up for their service confirmation notices
                giving the consumers the opportunity to cancel and receive a refund. The companies covered
                by the order with Simple.Net include Simple Access, Inc., Dial Up Services, Inc., and ISP
                Marketing, Inc.</font></p>
