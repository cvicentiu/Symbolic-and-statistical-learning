<h3>Gregory Crane, <i>The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New

"Greek Studies: Inter-disciplinary Approaches" (General Editor Gregory
Nagy). It is an attempt to show how certain ideas or attitudes changed in
the Greek world between the time of Herodotus and Thucydides. Perhaps I
should write, how those two authors reflect or illustrate the changes.
</P><P> Let me make my negative comments first. The use of Greek vs. a
translation or a transliteration is inconsistent. Crane tends to be
consistent within a chapter, but not throughout the book (v. chapters 6
and 7). At times a long passage of Greek is given with a translation,
sometimes without (see, for example, chapters 3 and 4). The same is true
of short passages. There is a similar inconsistency in his figures/charts.
Sometimes Greek is given with a transliteration, sometimes only Greek or a
transliteration, sometimes only Greek or a transliteration with an English
translation, (see, for example, 46-47, only Greek; 84, Greek with an
English translation; 141, transliteration with English translation).
Normally a transliteration is used in the text, but again there is no
consistency. This may be unimportant, but it will make reading the work
confusing for people who do not know Greek. And there are such people who
will probably find this book of interest. </P><P> I also have a problem
with the title. It gives only a vague hint as to the matter of the book.
Chapters 1 and 7 come closest to justifying the title. On page 81, Crane
writes "the usage of Thucydides and Herodotus is the subject of this
study." While that comment is meant to pertain to the chapter in which it
appears, it is a good indication of what the book is about. There are
those who would be interested in the comparisons. Due to the title, they
may never look here. Perhaps the title should have reflected the content.
</P><P> One final negative comment: an index of cited passages would be
helpful. The focus of the work is on word usage. When the same passage is
cited in different contexts, it would be useful to be able to check the
use of the passage for other points. Crane rarely refers to the other
occurrences. </P><P> With these negative comments out of the way, I would
like to say that the book is well worth reading. Anyone interested in how
Thucydides wrote and how his use of words shows his basic ideas and
interpretations will find this book of great interest. Many have pointed
out that an intellectual 'revolution' occurred in fifth century Athens and
that Thucydides was a product of this revolution while Herodotus was not.
Crane, by a close study of the word usage of the two men, has shown their
different outlooks, the differences in their views on society and
politics, and the differences in their methods and styles. Their use of
the same words and their preference for particular words are analyzed to
show the outlook of each man. In doing so, he also shows the change in
ideas and outlooks between the two generations. </P><P> Ch. 1 gives a
description of the growth of the importance of written works in the fifth
century and how they affected Thucydides. 23-26 give a brief summary of
the points to be made in the other chapters. Chapters 2-6 are the heart of
the book. In these chapters, Crane gives a detailed analysis of the
language used by the two men. Ch. 2 explores the claims to authority made
by both men by concentrating on the word atrekeia (precision). One
interesting comment, "Both Herodotus and Thucydides attempt to become
transparent lenses onto their subjects, but the two focus on different
points, Herodotus on the evidence and the source material, Thucydides on a
final intellectual synthesis for which the sources are the tool" (65).
65-73 make several good points about Thucydides' speeches, especially
regarding the difference between the spoken and the written word. </P><P>
Chs. 3-6 take up particular concepts and explain how each author dealt
with them: women and kinship, the position of oikos and polis, and
religion. </P><P> There is not space to go into detail on each of these
ideas. Perhaps Ch. 4, "Thucydidean Exclusions and the Language of Polis
II: Oikos, Genos, and Polis," will serve as an example. </P><P> Crane
writes about the distinction between oikos and polis, "Thucydides reflects
a trend that we can trace in other sources, but he exaggerated this trend
to an unparalleled degree, dismissing virtually all kinship terms, male as
well as female. He elides kinship and particular families because he
polemically constructs a discourse in which the city-state is predominant"
(111). Crane then uses a comparison of word usage by Herodotus and
Thucydides to show this conflict. His aim is to show that the polis was
becoming the dominant element rather than oikos or genos. "For the
Thucydidean Perikles, there were only two players: the polis and the
individual citizen, between whom no oikos or kinship group should
intervene" (133). Crane's view is that there was a change in focus during
the fifth century and that this can be demonstrated by studying Herodotus
and Thucydides. Thucydides, according to Crane, seems to have decided that
family and kinship had no part in his story (137) and that this shapes
Thucydides' account (140). </P><P> At times, Crane may be pushing his
evidence. One might, at times, question how he views the use of the word
oikos and whether all his examples are relevant (e.g., 128, 129 n. 33).
But even discounting some of his examples, there are still many to support
his view. And he makes a strong case for the idea that the study of word
usage can aid understanding of Thucydides' view of his world and how that
view influenced his interpretations of events. </P><P> The book does give
the impression of having been written as separate articles seeking a
common theme pasted together by Ch. 1 and Ch. 7. As an interdisciplinary
study, it fails. The few references to other fields seem to have been
placed simply to justify the book as an interdisciplinary work. There are
inconsistencies. Those criticisms should not deter you from reading the
book. Crane's study of word usage will be of interest to those who are
concerned with the changes in attitudes, both secular and religious, that
occurred in the fifth century. By comparing Herodotus and Thucydides,
Crane has shown the changes. </P>
