    <P>Digital libraries can be an extremely effective method of extending the
      services of a traditional library by enabling activities such as access to
      materials outside the physical confines of the library <A NAME="anch1"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn1">[1]</A>.
      The true benefit of a digital library, however, comes not from the
      replication and enhancement of traditional library functions, but rather
      in the ability to make possible tasks that would not be possible outside
      the electronic environment, such as the hypertextual linking of related
      texts, full text searching of holdings, and the integration of knowledge
      management, data visualization, and geographic information tools with the
      texts in the digital library. One of the challenges in building this type
      of system is the ability to apply these sorts of tools in a scalable
      manner to a large number of documents tagged according to different levels
      of specificity, tagging conventions, and document type definitions (DTDs).
      To address this challenge, we have developed a generalizable toolset to
      manage XML and SGML documents of varying DTDs for the Perseus Digital
      Library. These tools extract structural and descriptive metadata from
      these documents, deliver well formed document fragments on demand to a
      text display system, and can be extended with other modules that support
      the sort of advanced applications required to unlock the potential of a
      digital library. </P>
    
    <H3>I. What is Perseus?</H3>
    
    <P>The Perseus digital library is a heterogeneous collection of texts and
      images pertaining to the Archaic and Classical Greek world, late
      Republican and early Imperial Rome, the English Renaissance, and 19th
      Century London. <A NAME="anch2"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn2">[2]</A> The texts are
      integrated with morphological analysis tools, student and advanced lexica,
      and sophisticated searching tools that allow users to find all of the
      inflected instantiations of a particular lexical form. <A NAME="anch3"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn3">[3]</A>
      The current corpus of Greek texts contains approximately four million
      words by thirty-three different authors. Most of the texts were written in
      the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E., with some written as late as the
      second century C.E. The corpus of Latin texts contains approximately one
      million five hundred thousand words mostly written by authors from the
      republican and early imperial periods. <A NAME="anch4"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn4">[4]</A>
      The digital library also contains more than 30,000 images, 1000 maps, and
      a comprehensive catalog of sculpture. Collections of English language
      literature from the Renaissance and the 19th century will be added in the
      fall of 2000. </P>
    
    <H3>II. Building Documents</H3>
    
    <P>In developing this collection of SGML and now XML documents, we have
      benefited from the generality and abstraction of structured markup which
      has allowed us to deliver our content smoothly on a variety of platforms.
      The vast majority of our documents are tagged according to the guidelines
      established by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). <A NAME="anch5"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn5">[5]</A>
      While we have had a great deal of success with these guidelines, other
      digitization projects have found other DTDs more useful for their
      purposes. <A NAME="anch6"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn6">[6]</A> As XML becomes more
      widely used, more and more specifications for different subject fields and
      application domains are being created by various industries and user
      communities; a well known and extensive list of XML applications includes
      a wide variety of markup standards for different domains ranging from
      genealogy to astronomy. <A NAME="anch7"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn7">[7]</A>
      Customized DTDs ease the encoding of individual documents and often allow
      scholars to align their tags with the intellectual conventions of their
      field. At the same time, they can raise barriers to both basic and
      advanced applications within a digital library. To take a simple example,
      a programmer wishing to extract all of the book titles mentioned in a
      collection of documents marked according to more than one DTD might may
      have to look for a &lt;cit&gt; tag in some documents and a &lt;title&gt;
      tag in others, whose DTD might use the &lt;cit&gt; tag to mean a piece of
      quoted text. More importantly, a document's structural metadata, which is
      intended to allow access to logical parts of the document, is tied to
      specific concrete element names. In order to find &quot;chapter 5&quot; in
      an XML document, the user or system implementor must know something about
      that document's markup --- whether the DTD and encoding conventions favor
      counting to the fifth &lt;chapter&gt; tag or searching for &lt;div2 type=&quot;chapter&quot;
      n=&quot;5&quot;&gt;. <A NAME="anch8"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn8">[8]</A> </P>
    
    <P>To address this problem, our system allows digital librarians to create
      partial mappings between the elements in a DTD and abstract structural
      elements and then produces an index of the elements so mapped. What is
      encoded as &lt;div1 type=&quot;scene&quot;&gt; in one document and as &lt;scene&gt;
      in another is presented to the system as an abstract, structural &quot;scene&quot;.
      Identifier attributes on XML elements, such as 'ID' or 'N', are also
      indexed, and occurrences of each structure within the document are
      sequentially numbered. A mapping may also specify that some of the
      document's content, such as section titles or dates, be recorded and
      passed on to other resource discovery or visualization modules within the
      system. Finally, not every element in the DTD need be mapped. This allows
      the digital librarians to focus attention on the structural features of
      the texts. After this structural element map is created for the DTD, an
      unlimited number of documents written in conformance with this DTD can be
      parsed and indexed by the system. </P>
    
    <H3>III. Document Delivery</H3>
    
    <P>One of the primary benefits that we derive from this system is the
      ability to display any number of documents tagged according to the same
      DTD very quickly. In previous instantiations of the Perseus Digital
      Library, after a text was tagged, it was necessary to write a custom
      specification to transform the archival SGML text into a form that could
      be delivered to end users to read. We also were required to add the
      document to both our catalog and our searching programs by hand. This
      process not only added extra time to the process of publishing a document,
      it also was prone to error. It was possible, for example, to publish a
      document that was not indexed or included in the searching interface.
      Likewise, it was possible for an uncataloged document to exist in the
      digital library and only be accessible by knowing and typing in the exact
      URL required to display the document. In the new system, cataloging
      information is automatically extracted from the document headers and
      included in the table of contents and other searching interfaces. This has
      enabled us to cut dramatically the time required to include new documents
      in the Perseus digital library; in fact, since we released this software
      on our production servers in the spring of 2000, we have been able to add
      substantial collections of Latin texts and commentaries on Greek texts to
      the digital library. <A NAME="anch9"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn9">[9]</A> In
      addition to facilitating our own work, this system has also allowed us to
      collaborate more effectively with other projects. For example, we have
      been conducting experiments with the SGML documents created by the Library
      of Congress American Memory project and the documents on the <I>Thesaurus
      Linguae Graecae</I> CD ROM. <A NAME="anch10"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn10">[10]</A>
      In internal experiments, we have been able to integrate large numbers of
      texts from these collections into the Perseus Digital Library with very
      little custom programming and gain the benefits of all of the advanced
      modules in this system. </P>
    
    <P>One of the modules in our system allows us to create custom display
      templates for different documents or collections. When a user requests a
      document, our display system locates the XML file and its associated
      metadata, uses the abstracted mappings to determine which portion of the
      file contains the desired text section, applies appropriate styling rules,
      and presents the text to the end user in HTML. The styling rules are
      controlled by templates that allow us to create a custom look and feel for
      different texts or collections of texts within the digital library.
      Currently, this template is written in HTML with place-holders for
      variable display elements and the text itself. We can also apply these
      templates to objects in the digital library: images, maps, or searching
      tools. We produce HTML output because our current primary delivery
      mechanism is the World Wide Web. Our display system can produce other
      formats, notably Adobe's Portable Document Format and raw XML.
      <A NAME="anch11"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn11">[11]</A> As browser support for XML
      becomes more robust, we expect to exploit XSL (Extensible Stylesheet
      Language) or other XML styling tools to produce attractive direct XML
      displays in this module. </P>
    
    <H3>IV. Knowledge Management Tools</H3>
    
    <P>The advantages of this toolset extend far beyond the practical issues
      related to displaying, cataloging, and indexing documents for end users.
      Because this system abstracts the metadata from the text, we are able to
      develop scalable tools for linguistic analysis, knowledge management, and
      information retrieval within the digital library, thereby allowing users
      to work with documents in ways that would simply not be possible outside
      the digital environment. The tools in the currently existing system
      include sophisticated full-text searching tools, the creation of live
      links among documents in the system, extraction of toponyms and the
      automatic generation of maps, discovery of dates and the dynamic display
      of timelines, the automatic implicit searching, discovery of word
      co-occurrence patterns, and linkages to morphological analysis. </P>
    
    <P>A great deal of traditional scholarship involves tracking down footnotes
      and discovering what others have said about a text. Our toolset allows us
      to display links to other texts that cite the document currently being
      displayed. A simple example is a commentary, which explicitly talks about
      another text. For example, when a reader views the text of Thucydides or
      Homer's Iliad, we are able to show notes from several commentaries about
      these texts. Much more exciting, however, is the ability to display
      citations from texts that are not explicitly related to each other. For
      example, a reader of Andocides 1.57 might be interested to know that
      <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=andoc.+1.57">this
        passage</A> is cited in section 2017 of Smyth's <I>Greek Grammar</I>.
      The reader can follow an active link to this Smyth passage and read the
      discussion there about the usage of the word <I>eipon</I> and compare
      other passages also cited by Smyth to illustrate this point. Because this
      'citation reversal' happens automatically each time a text is added to the
      system, it becomes even more valuable as the digital library expands. This
      system also reveals unexpected links among texts, which scholars might not
      have been aware of. A reader of Homer might be surprised to find that <I>Iliad</I>
      8.442 is cited in the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare's <I>Coriolanus</I>,
      V.i. </P>
    
    <P>Another module automatically scans the English language texts in the
      digital library for place names. These names are linked to a Geographic
      Information System (GIS) that allows users to generate a map of the places
      mentioned in the entire document, in the section currently being
      displayed, or in a larger logical unit, for example a book or an act.
      <A NAME="anch12"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn12">[12]</A> Moreover, the map serves
      as a gateway into the collection, since users can move from a spot on the
      map to a document that refers to it. The tool can also be used to map all
      of the places mentioned in a collection of documents. For example, a map
      of the American Memory texts shows that most of the documents in this
      collection describe places in North America, while a map of
      <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/perscoll?collection=Bolles">our
        collection of documents about 19th century London</A> shows very few
      discussions of places in North America. While these examples are
      relatively obvious, they illustrate how this tool might be used to show a
      new user the characteristics of the collections within the digital
      library. At the same time, the digital librarian need not add metadata
      describing the geographic and temporal extent of a collection. For this
      tool, our abstraction of structural and descriptive metadata is more
      important than the markup of the individual documents: place names are
      discovered by an information extraction system after the documents have
      been indexed. <A NAME="anch13"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn13">[13]</A> Because the
      XML back end described above presents all documents to the information
      discovery module in a uniform way, the GIS programmer need not be aware of
      the details of the DTDs or of the markup conventions used in the texts.
    </P>
    
    <P>A third tool automatically extracts date information and uses this
      information to generate timelines of the dates mentioned in texts. The
      dates in this timeline are active links, leading to the passage in the
      text that contains this link. This means that the reader of a text who is
      interested in events that happened in
      <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/timevis?id=Perseus:text:2000.01.0008">1666</A>
      can quickly locate these passages on the timeline. Likewise, a reader can
      use this timeline to locate other passages that describe the date in
      question. This tool, like the mapping tool, can also be applied to
      collections of documents, allowing users to gain a sense of what time
      frame the documents cover. For example, when this tool is applied to our
      Greco-Roman collection, users can quickly see that we have much greater
      coverage of the Classical period than of the Hellenistic period. </P>
    
    <P>We have exploited this abstraction in other information extraction
      systems we have written, one of which is the creation of automatic
      hypertexts for implicit searching.<A NAME="anch14"></A><A HREF="perseus-rydberg-cox-ariadne.html#fn14">[14]</A>
      Important subject terms within the domain area are recognized and linked
      to other documents within the digital library that contain the term. These
      links are provided automatically for every document when it is displayed.
      This makes it easy for readers to get fuller information about important
      ideas, to contextualize unfamiliar vocabulary, and to explore related
      documents in the digital library. Because subject terms are linked to
      dynamic hypertexts, not to simple glossary or dictionary entries, readers
      can explore types of material they might not have thought relevant (or
      even have known of): historical texts, site plans, art works, or the like.
      Further, as the library expands, new documents appear on these pages
      without any additional programming. In addition to helping users explore
      large domains, we also have modules that help users explore the smallest
      details of the language. These details include morphology and word
      co-occurrence. Every word of Latin or Greek is passed through a
      morphological analyzer and the resulting analyses are placed in a
      database. When Greek or Latin text is displayed, each word is checked
      against this database, and links are generated between words and their
      analyses. These analyses, in turn, are linked to a suite of dictionaries
      and grammars, allowing users to read texts in languages they do not yet
      know well. Another module that operates at the level of the word
      identifies words that regularly co-occur. Abstracted indices are used to
      scan texts and calculate word frequencies and co-occurrence ratios. Highly
      significant word pairs can be presented along with lexical information, or
      in independent tabular displays. </P>
    
    <P>While it certainly would be possible to develop many of these tools
      without the document management system described here, this document
      management system makes this task much easier. The abstraction of the
      varying tagging systems in these documents allows programmers to focus on
      interesting tasks instead of dealing with different tagging systems on an
      ad hoc basis. Further, because these tools function as 'modules' within
      the Perseus digital library rather than stand-alone programs, we can apply
      these tools to every text that is added to the library without any
      additional programming. This allows us to begin to meet the challenges
      involved in the scalable creation of a digital library that does not
      simply replicate and enhance the tasks of a traditional library, but
      rather renders it possible for a large number of people to study texts in
      ways that would not be possible outside the electronic environment. </P>

      The audience for these texts and tools in an integrated digital library
      does exist and it is larger than one might expect. The past four years
      have seen remarkable increase in the use of the Perseus web site. Usage
      has grown from just under three thousand hits on its first day in July of
