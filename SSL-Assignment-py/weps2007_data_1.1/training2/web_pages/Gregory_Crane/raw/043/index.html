Gregory Crane's interests are twofold. On the one hand, he has published on a 
wide range of ancient Greek authors (including articles on Greek drama and 
Hellenistic poetry and a book on the <I>Odyssey</I>).
Much of his recent energy has been devoted to Thucydides;  his book 
<I>The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New Written Word</I> has just appeared
from Rowman and Littlefield; he has a second Thucydides book (<I>The 
Ancient Simplicity: Thucydides and the Limits of Political Realism</I>)
completed and in the final stages of editorial review.
He is currently engaged in writing a book on imperialism
and the crisis of legitimacy in the fifth century.
<p>
At the same time, he has a long-standing interest in the relationship between
the humanities and rapidly developing digital technology.
He began this side of his work as a graduate student at Harvard when the Classics
Department purchased its first TLG authors on magnetic tape in the summer of
1982. He developed a Unix-based full text retrieval system for the TLG
that was widely used in North America and Europe in the middle 1980s. He
also helped establish a typesetting consortium to facilitate scholarly 
publishing. Since 1985 he has been engaged in planning and development of
the Perseus Project, which he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. Besides
supervising the Perseus Project as a whole, he has been primarily 
responsible for the development of the morphological analysis system which
provides many of the links within the Perseus database.
