                <p><strong>What are we trying to do? &#8211; the Challenge of
                  Cultural Communication</strong></p>
                <p>I would like to focus on the problem of cultural communication:
                  understanding cultures, our own and those of others very different
                  from us, and communicating our understanding both of ourselves
                  and of others to the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>The importance of such cultural communication cannot be overstated.
                  The war on terror is a war about culture &#8212; while material
                  causes such as oil or land may contribute to the problems that
                  we face, the acts of violence that we confront are only the
                  most acute (and overtly destructive) symptoms of a broader
                  conflict between cultures in a changing world. Such cultural
                  conflicts extend well beyond the West and Islam (e.g., ethnic
                  terrorism in Rwanda and Congo) and have been, in one form or
                  another, endemic to human history, but the threats to U. S.
                  security have clearly escalated. And if the war on terror has
                  influenced our view of cultures, we must remember that culture
                  stands at the core of human existence. Preserving and disseminating
                  cultural heritage is a core responsibility for any government.</p>
                <p>The challenges posed by terrorism have risen high on the U.
                  S. agenda. Programs such as DARPA&#8217;s Translingual Information
                  Detection, Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) have acquired
                  a new urgency, as intelligence agencies attempt to extract
                  useful information from vast bodies of data. At the same time,
                  the administration&#8217;s proposed &#8220;We the people initiative&#8221; (<a href="http://www.wethepeople.gov/">http://www.wethepeople.gov/</a>) &#8212; a
                  $100 million three year NEH effort &#8211; addresses the problem
                  of articulating American history and culture. On its homepage
                  Bruce Cole, NEH Chairman, explicitly cites the attacks on September
                  11as a motivating cause for this effort. Many U. S. government
                  institutions, including the Library of Congress, the Institute
                  for Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment for
                  the Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Park Service
                  and others, constantly labor to improve and disseminate knowledge
                  about American history and culture.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the rise of information technology has not only
                  opened up new ways of analyzing cultural heritage materials
                  but has created the need for a new area of study. Possible
                  labels for this new field include &#8220;computing and the
                  humanities&#8221; and &#8220;computational humanities&#8221; but
                  I would suggest &#8220;cultural informatics&#8221; or some
                  other term that emphasizes culture in the broadest possible
                  sense, including not only the humanities and cultural heritage
                  materials but regarding all forms of current culture as well.</p>
                <p>Consider two broad applications:</p>
                <p><strong>Cultural awareness</strong>: How do we track changes in cultural values
                  and attitudes not only in the past but in real time? Such a
                  task is immense, for it assumes systems that can manage hundreds,
                  if not thousands, of languages and cultural groups. We need
                  to stress the importance of culture and language alike &#8212; information
                  extraction may track telephone numbers or military appointments
                  (e.g., General X is now in command of facility Y) but in this
                  case, multiple languages describe trans-cultural objects: the
                  information is the same and the language serves as a semi-transparent
                  delivery medium.<br>
                  But the values which motivate humans most strongly &#8211; virtue,
                  justice, even love and friendship &#8211; are not only fluid
                  and resistant to reductive definition in any one culture, but
                  vary substantially from one culture to another. Most inhabitants
                  of the Western world shook their head when Osama Bin Laden
                  cited a prophetic dream during a recorded video. Those of us
                  who have worked with ancient Near Eastern or even classical
                  Greek literature, however, realized that Bin Laden was following
                  ancient habits of thought. We need instruments to assess culturally
                  specific attitudes that are foreign to the discourse of international
                  technocratic elites. We need to be able to assess how typical
                  a particular sentiment may be (e.g., how commonly do conservative
                  Saudis use dreams in this way? Is Bin Laden typical? Or is
                  he self-consciously striking an archaic pose?)</p>
                <p>Since small numbers of determined individual can potentially
                  wreak immense havoc, we cannot predict where the next threat
                  will originate. Security concerns thus augment broader interests
                  in culture, demanding systems that can automatically analyse
                  cultural materials in radically new ways.</p>
                <p>Consider as one particular application of general semantic
                  analysis a visualization system that tracked intensity of feelings
                  about a particular topic across the globe. The system would
                  take a range of textual materials from many different sources
                  and languages and produce a measure of the feelings on a given
                  topic. The system might use temperature gradients as a visualization
                  metaphor, allowing viewers to track hostility towards the United
                  States as it ebbs and flows across the world. Such a system
                  could provide data for strategic planning, allowing the United
                  States to identify problem areas as they emerge and before
                  they generate violent attacks.</p>
                <p>Such semantic analysis may be feasible for a constrained set
                  of genres and languages, but a truly scalable system would
                  not only have to manage a dizzying variety of languages but
                  would also have to assess the relative rhetorical intensity
                  of a given source: the same terminology can have radically
                  different significance in a restrained bureaucratic document
                  and in a hyperbolic partisan news story.</p>
                <p><span class="underline">Spatial customization</span>: Computing may become ubiquitous and
                  the capitalism that shapes all of our lives pushes us to transcend
                  our local surroundings, but many, if not most, human beings
                  treasure a strong sense of place. The perceived rootlessness
                  of capitalist and especially American life is arguably one
                  of the most powerful concepts behind opposition to globalization
                  in general and the United States in particular.</p>
                <p>Connecting history to place has, historically, been a difficult
                  task. Those who live in long established communities may have
                  only the dimmest understanding about the generations who lived,
                  struggled, suffered, laughed, walked and died in the areas
                  through which they now walk each day. We can, however, imagine
                  systems that would deliver customized information to individuals
                  as they move through a particular space. A system may alert
                  the visitor that an object of interest (a Greek revival house
                  built in 1847, a statue commemorating a hero of the anti-slavery
                  movement, the home of a jazz musician) is only a few steps
                  away, provide a survey of the names and occupations of those
                  who lived in a particular building, historic images of their
                  current location or dynamic VRML representations of the location
                  in a particular period.</p>
                <p>Such dynamic spatially customized data clearly has broad military
                  and commercial applications, but military and commercial needs,
                  however acute or potentially lucrative, are subsets of cultural
                  analysis. Note that, as with purely textual information extraction,
                  some crucial questions may be relatively easy to identify (e.g.,
                  location of possible ambush points, identification of customers
                  for a particular product) but long term success may depend
                  upon access to much more diffuse information about local practice
                  and knowledge. </p>
                <p><strong>How do we accomplish cultural communication today?</strong></p>
                <p>At present, thousands of researchers in a variety of disciplines
                  study cultures past and present. The vast majority of these
                  researchers distribute the results of their work in diffuse
                  papers (such as this position paper) and monographs. While
                  almost all make use of electronic text processing and search
                  various resources, most content themselves with basic searches
                  of fragmented data sources. </p>
                <p><strong>What is new and why do we think it will be successful?</strong></p>
                <p>Such venues as the Text Retrieval Evaluation Conference, the
                  Document Understanding Conference, Automatic Context Extraction,
                  Cross Language Evaluation Forum, etc. are now documenting the
                  capabilities of a range of emerging language technologies.
                  If we could simply apply to conventional stuudy the state of
                  the art in technologies such as automatic multi- and single-document
                  summarization, question answering, clustering, cross language
                  information retrieval, named entity and relation detection,
                  sense disambiguation, etc., we could revolutionize the ways
                  in which we analyze culture.</p>
                <p>Emerging language technologies have, however, been developed
                  largely by engineers to work with modern genres (e.g., news
                  publications produced and edited by professional journalists).
                  We need to adapt existing techniques and develop new approaches
                  to work with the diffuse genres from the cultures and languages
                  of the world. </p>
                <p><strong>Assuming we are successful, what difference does it make?</strong></p>
                <p>Increased cross-cultural understanding/exchange can increase
                  communication, reduce the impulse to violence and expand socio-economic
                  connections. Thus, potential benefits include enhanced global
                  peace and prosperity.</p>
                <p><strong>How long will it take and how will we know when we get there?</strong></p>
                <p>Cultural cyberinfrastructure requires two fundamental components.</p>
                <p>First, we need knowledge resources. Some of these exist in
                  digital form and can be federated into a useful resource network.
                  Some digital sources will prove sufficiently inconsistent in
                  form and/or quality that they need to be recreated. Most historical
                  sources remain available only in print form. Many of the most
                  useful potential sources are reference works that are expensive
                  to enter (e.g., city directories) and have rich, but complex
                  formats (e.g., dictionaries, grammars, encyclopedias). Automation
                  can potentially reduce the costs of large-scale scanning to
                  very low levels, but some tasks may require carefully entered
                  and marked-up knowledge sources (c. $500-$1,000/mbyte). The
                  DARPA TIDES program has studied the problem of boot-strapping
                  new languages. Our initial estimate, based on our own experiences
                  with a handful of languages, leads us to suggest that $100
                  million would probably allow us to provide consistent initial
                  coverage 100 major culture/language clusters (thus allowing
                  us to consider Indian/English, UK/English, US/English). Actual
                  costs would depend upon factors such as the complexity of the
                  language, the availability of core resources (e.g., bi-lingual
                  corpora, lexica, etc.) in print and/or electronic form, etc.
                  The time required will depend upon the range of services developed:
                  cross-language information retrieval and very rough machine
                  translation may require relatively little time, but each language/culture
                  cluster will pose its own problems. Nevertheless, three years
                  should be enough for a competent team to provide basic language/culture
                  services. Assuming two years of preparation, three cycles of
                  grant competitions for language/culture teams, and the usual
                  extensions/delays, we should be able to see major results in
                  five years and a solid 100 language/culture infrastructure
                  in 10.</p>
                <p>Second, we need researchers who can assess the latest findings
                  of various cultural disciplines and of emerging information
                  technologies. We do not yet have the institutional framework
                  to train the researchers with professional training in the
                  analysis of culture and the possibilities of emerging technologies,
                  language and otherwise. Cultural disciplines have not developed
                  a strong cultural informatics &#8211; and these disciplines
                  may never, as currently constituted, have the resources to
                  support such a sub-discipline. </p>
                <p>In an ideal scenario, departments in computer science, information
                  science and various cultural domain disciplines would all train
                  students and support faculty concentrating on various elements
                  of cultural informatics. NSF support for cultural informatics
                  should be aimed at helping this discipline develop the scientific
                  and engineering rigor that it needs. While it will take five
                  to ten years to develop a solid core of new researchers, the
                  results of DLI-2 support suggest that we should begin to see
                  research results within one to two years.</p>
