                Classicists have an unusual perspective on many
                of the arguments about the history of the book.
                Many critics who lament the passing of the
                literate world into which they were born often
                frame their concerns in such narrow historical
                terms that they can unintentionally trivialize
                the changes that fear are overwhelming us.
                Clifford Stoll's</font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Silicon Snake Oil </i>[1]
                fiercely critiques the virtual existence offered
                by the brave new electronic world, but almost all
                of these criticisms were leveled at book culture
                as well. Sven Birkert's <i>Gutenberg Elegies </i>[2]
                has established itself as a focal point for
                resistance, but, telling as many of his points
                may be and sympathetic as I find many of his
                intellectual values, his work seems to delight in
                its limitations.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">The intellectual
                world upon which he draws scarcely extends beyond
                the lifetime of a single human being. The
                earliest book that he cites in this collection of
                essays was published in 1929 -- not a single
                publication was old enough to have forced its way
                into the public domain. The <i>Gutenberg Elegies</i>
                laments the putative end of an intellectual world
                that is anchored in the past two generations --
                precisely that period in which in which film,
                radio and television have savaged eroded the
                culture of the book and in which book culture has
                attracted many who enjoy the position of
                marginalized intellectuals surrounded by the
                barbarian hordes of &quot;mall culture.&quot; </font></p>

                Those who have most closely studied both new
                technology and the broader history of
                intellectual life seem, for the most part, less
                fretful about the future. Richard Lanham rightly
                traces modern debates about the role of
                technology back to the arguments of rhetoric vs.
                truth that centered around Isocrates and Plato in
                the fourth century BCE. George Landow and Janet
                Murray, trained as experts in Victorian
                literature and immersed in the textuality of the
                nineteenth century, have emerged among the most
                sympathetic and serious analysts of hypertext.
                Jerome McGann, an eminent textual critic and thus
                expert in the most genuinely (and constructively)
                conservative practice of the humanities, has
                found in the new medium both a way to publish the
                works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti more effectively
                than he could in print and a challenge to the
                ways in which we conceive of textuality itself.
                Jerome McGann's colleague at the University of
                Virginia, John Unsworth, the founding editor of
                PostModern Culture, is, as director of the
                Institute for Advanced Technology in the
                Humanities, actively supporting a range of
                humanistic research projects that range from the
                classical antiquity to modern culture.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">As a specialist in
                classical Greek literature and especially as a
                classicist at a university largely dominated by
                engineers, MD-Phds, social scientists and
                &quot;humanists&quot; deeply suspicious of the
                label &quot;humanism&quot; and of all traditional
                culture, I understand the position of
                marginalized intellectual all too well, but I am,
                in many ways, more interested in the general
                public than I am in my professional colleagues.
                Those of us who have been so fortunate as to win
                permanent jobs depend for our continued existence
                upon a consensus among non-professionals that
                what we do matters. The National Endowment for
                the Humanities almost vanished, in large measure
                because many American citizens believed, and not
                wholly without reason, that humanists had little
                interest in, and even disdain for, those outside
                of the academy. Decimated, the NEH survived, but
                its troubles suggested that we in the humanities
                must reestablish the relationship between our
                work and society at large. Whatever the fate of
                the NEH and whether or not we depend upon NEH's
                support for our research, the NEH drew fire that
                was aimed squarely at all of us in the
                humanities. Electronic media -- whether
                self-standing artifacts like CD-ROMs and Digital
                Video Disks or distributed hypertexts like the
                World Wide Web -- constitute a new vernacular,
                much as Italian or Chaucer's English. It is our
                responsibility, as humanists, not only to master
                this vernacular but to foster its development.
                The greatest challenge that we face over the
                coming years is the need to adapt ourselves to
                the new media and the new media to those
                intellectual and cultural values that we cherish.</font></p>

                Classicists as a group certainly have their share
                of techno-angst and the achievements of our
                discipline in adapting digital tools to our use
                have not assuaged the fears that many of our
                colleagues still share. Nevertheless, those
                trained in classics who have thought seriously
                about the technology often seem much less anxious
                than many of their post-modern colleagues: a
                generation ago, the classicist Eric Havelock
                earned a prominent position beside Marshall
                McCluhan and Walter Ong as a pioneer in the study
                of media and culture. More recently, Jay Bolter
                and James O'Donnell have emerged among the most
                creative analysts of the changes around us.
                Richard Lanham's insights derive much of their
                strength from his sense of history and from this
                recognition that debates about electronic media
                now raging continue discussions underway since
                the continuous European tradition of literate
                culture took shape in the fifth-century BCE.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The enthusiasm with which
                many classicists have embraced the new technology
                has several causes. First, the book-- the
                physical object with two covers and rectangular
                pages bound together -- has been grossly
                misrepresented. The codex is a relatively late
                product and our earliest references to the codex
                appear in the poems of Martial during the late
                first century CE, after the Greeks and the Romans
                had built up more than eight hundred years of an
                intensely felt textual culture. The great library
                of Alexandria, when in the first century BCE it
                caught fire for the first time, was therefore
                stuffed full of scrolls and not books.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vergil, writing
                in the first century BCE, was one of the most
                influential intellectual figures and successful
                poets who ever lived. He produced poems that
                played to a passionate immersion in and
                commitment to literary texts. But Vergil lived in
                a world of scrolls -- he probably never saw a
                book in his entire life. I have yet to see any
                cogent argument that the arrival of the codex
                improved the quality of literature or made
                possible more keenly felt literary sensibilities
                than those that we can, by dint of much hard work
                and skill, recover from the work of Vergil or the
                Hellenistic Greek poets who preceded him. I have
                no desire to play off Vergil against Dante, or
                Homer against Shakespeare or to argue that the
                cultures of the codex or that of print are
                inferior to that which was in place when the
                codex first began to appear. But I see no basis
                at all for an argument that book culture per se
                allowed human beings to reach higher levels of
                literary creativity or to participate in a richer
                intellectual world than the written culture that
                preceded it.</font></p>

                Second, it is not at all clear that the effects
                of the codex upon reading were, on the balance,
                at all good for that intense linear reading which
                we celebrate as the starting point of literary
                experience. The comparison between printed book
                and later twentieth century computer screen has
                not carried us very far. The real comparison
                should be between the codex and the scroll.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">It would be interesting to
                perform experiments comparing the experience of
                readers working through a continuous text, from
                beginning to end, in a codex and in a continuous
                scroll. It would not be easy to design a
                convincing experiment that probed these
                differences if all of the participants in this
                experiment had grown up in book cultures: we
                would have to compare the impressions of those
                who grew up handling scrolls to those whose
                parents had, as impressionable children, had
                listened to their own parents read codices to
                them in bed. I suspect that a published essay
                called &quot;<i>The Aristotle Elegies</i>,&quot;
                lamenting the fall of that scroll culture which
                the great Athenian intellectual had helped to
                define, would have found a sympathetic audience
                in the second century CE.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, the codex
                was successful not for literary but for
                utilitarian reasons. First, the book, with its
                flat pages laid on top of one another, takes up
                less space than a scroll: codices take up less
                &quot;shelf-space.&quot; Second, because codices
                readily support writing on both sides, they could
                store roughly twice as much information per
                square inch. Despite the wastage that comes from
                having bottom and top margins and empty space
                near the binding, codices are essentially a
                double-density storage medium -- a savings
                especially significant before the development of
                inexpensive paper. Third, even in manuscript form
                and before the settled conventions of running
                headers, standard page numbers, tables of
                contents, indices and other aids solidified in
                the age of print, books are far better suited to
                random access than scrolls. It is hard to imagine
                that you could ever unroll a lengthy scroll as
                quickly as you can flip the pages of the codex.</font></p>

                It was the codex that encouraged a culture of
                rapid, silent reading. Readers of a scroll
                expected to read slowly. Words were run together
                and paragraphs were not marked -- storage media
                was expensive but processing time was less of a
                concern because readers expected to spend a more
                time working their way through the document:
                silent (and thus rapid) reading was a relatively
                late development. Readers who sounded out the
                words before them experienced the text both
                visually and aurally -- thus drawing upon more
                than one sense at a time and anticipating a
                learning practice that cognitive scientists
                encourage. Full-blown book culture -- which
                married the codex to mechanical reproduction --
                produced a world of vast documents, quickly
                written and even more quickly consumed.
                Concentrated, self-consciously literary novelists
                such as Proust, James and, of course, Joyce,
                wrote against this tendency, saturating the
                ultimate codex genre, the novel, with that
                density of meaning and of reference which we can
                find already in Vergil (and, indeed, in the
                haunting prose of Thucydides). The great
                novelists were thus renewing, in a different
                medium and genre, that literary intensity which
                writing allows us to trace thousands of years
                further back. They were trying to charge the
                non-linear and rapidly-read codex with the
                literary texture that emerged with the texture of
                the linear and slowly-read scroll.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The preeminent literary
                genre of the book may well be the novel, but the
                preeminent genre of the book is the utilitarian
                reference tool -- the accountant's ledger, the
                maintenance manual, and, above all, the bulging
                filing cabinet (itself nothing less than a mass
                of fluid codices). To sacralize the book as an
                object in the defense of a literary or cultural
                ideal is thus a losing cause for two reasons.
                First, the book itself is part of the problem,
                for if we accept the book in place of the scroll,
                then we have reinforced that utilitarian logic
                that leads to the electronic hypertext is an
                entirely logical and defensible continuation. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, if we, as
                defenders of books and book culture, do not take
                into consideration the culture that precedes the
                book, we open ourselves to severe criticisms on
                both scientific and traditional grounds. Not only
                is our argument profoundly flawed but, if our
                understanding of history and literature is so
                shallow that we are oblivious to almost a
                millenium of Greco-Roman literary achievement,
                then how can we expect anyone else to respect the
                past? We certainly cannot all spend years
                studying Greek and Latin, but, if we entirely
                ignore Greco-Roman antiquity, we weaken the cause
                of all cultural memory and of that culture to
                which the scroll, the codex and the printed books
                have all contributed.</font></p>

                Media constrain the intellectual paths that we
                can and do pursue, but human creativity can

                Different forms of media are relatively neutral:
                the printed book gave us not only the novel and

                academic publications just as cynically aimed at
                reviewers and at the tenure/promotion/better jobs
                etc. that these reviewers will confer. To
                attribute such phenomena to a relentless
                technological determinism is a self-defeating
                strategy, because it can justify the role of
                querulously superior bystander.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">But if media are
                relatively neutral with respect to one another
                and susceptible to development in various ways,
                media themselves are not neutral. Once we
                transfer our ideas from the wetware between our
                ears and inscribe them in some artificial medium,
                whether a Sumerian clay tablet or an expert
                system for analyzing Greek morphology, storing
                our ideas over time and transmitting them to
                people whom we have never physically seen, we
                have entered a new world. The most cogent issues
                that we face today were already striking sparks
                classical Greece -- long before computers,
                printing presses or the codex. On the one hand,
                classical literary texts exhibit a technological
                boosterism comparable with which the capital
                hungry modern entrepreneur should sympathize. The
                lyric poet Pindar, a professional well paid for
                his skills and for the celebrity that he could
                confer, begins one poem by thumbing his nose at
                the sculptors with whom he competed for contracts
                to perpetuate the memory of the rich and
                successful: I am not a sculptor, to make statues
                that stand motionless on the same pedestal. Sweet
                song, go on every merchant-ship and rowboat that
                leaves Aegina, and announce that Lampon's
                powerful son Pytheas [5] won the victory garland
                for the pancratium at the Nemean games, a boy
                whose cheeks do not yet show the tender season
                that is mother to the dark blossom. (Pind. Nem.

                The famous athlete may erect a statue
                commemorating his deeds at Delphi and Olympia --
                these sites were, by the end of antiquity,
                crammed with statues and functioned very much
                like modern sports halls of fame -- but statutes,
                however imposing, can only be in one place at one
                time. When Pindar composed a poem, the text
                generally consisted of a few hundred words that
                could be readily copied and that could spread on
                every ship, great and small, throughout a Greek
                speaking world that extended from Spain to
                Russia. Neither Pindar nor his patrons had ever
                heard of copyright -- nor is it likely that they
                would have found much to commend this modern
                concept. Poet and patron alike depended for their
                success on the furious, uncontrolled circulation
                of the written text. The poet accumulated wealth
                by receiving generous gifts in exchange for each
                poem, and the cumulative fame of prior work lead
                to the next job -- in this regard, the poet
                earned money much more like a modern architect
                than author. The patron paid the poet because he
                wanted his name to be known as broadly as
                possible in space and as deeply as possible in
                time to come -- in the case of Lampon, surely one
                of the more successful investments in history,
                since we still possess the poem above, recalling
                Lampon and his son Pytheas each time that we read
                it.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The
                tragic drama <i>Prometheus Bound</i> is even more
                audacious. Zeus has punished Prometheus for
                giving mortals the gift of fire. At the center of
                this play stands a speech in which Prometheus
                recounts the many benefits that he had conferred
                on mortals: &quot;But I do not speak of this; for
                my tale would tell you nothing except what you
                know. Still, listen to the miseries that beset
                mankind -- how they were witless before and I
                made them have sense and endowed them with
                reason. [445] I will not speak to upbraid mankind

                Hobbesian early man whose life is nasty, brutish
                and short: before Prometheus, men had been
                helpless, utterly at the mercy of their
                environment. The speech goes on at some length
                cataloguing the various technical skills for
                which Prometheus was responsible, including (in
                the passage quoted above) architecture, an
                astronomically based calendar, and (in subsequent
                sections) domestication of animals, sea-faring,
                medicine, and metallurgy. At the core of
                Prometheus' gifts stand numbers, mathematics and
                writing -- the mother of the Muses' arts, which

                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fifth-century
                Greeks were acutely sensitive to the impact that
                an artificial storage system had exerted upon
                their culture. Their society remained, for the
                most part, oral:[3] contracts were pronounced
                before witnesses rather than signed and writing
                occupied a position closer to computer
                programming (i.e., a technical skill, fully
                mastered by a relative few) than modern writing
                (i.e., a fundamental skill which society expects,
                at least, all its members to acquire). Greeks did
                not have to be literature themselves to recognize
                that writing was something new and different.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly, the
                power of (then) modern information technology
                provoked, in classical Athens, anxiety as well as
                triumphalist visions. Euripides' <i>Phaedra</i>
                committed suicide but left behind a letter
                falsely accusing Hippolytus, her step-son, had
                sexually assaulted her (Eur. Hipp. 885-886):
                Theseus, Phaedra's husband, takes the message at
                face value. Hippolytus, confronted by a written
                message but, unable to interrogate the writer
                (Eur. Hipp. 1021ff.), is unable to defend
                himself. His father, to the dismay of the chorus,
                puts more credence in the uninterrogated writing
                of Phaedra than in a solemn oath sworn by
                Hippolytus (Eur. Hipp. 1036-1037), thus
                dramatizing the dangers of transferring authority
                from speech and to contemporary information
                technology -- we might compare the modern image
                of an innocent trapped by misinformation that had
                &quot;gotten into the computer.&quot; Writing
                both subverted and conferred authority: written
                law was, at least in the letter, fixed and, in
                theory, could be reviewed by all. Writing thus
                reduced the leeway of judges and of those who
                were expert in traditional wisdom. At the same
                time, writing allowed new laws to take on an
                instant authority that only usage over time could
                confer in a traditional society. Someone
                embroiled in a court case could appeal to the
                fact that a law was still agraphos, unwritten, to
                defend himself (e.g., Andoc. 1.85-86), but
                Athenians, who, like contemporary Americans, were
                remarkable for their reliance upon new media,
                were also deeply skeptical of these technologies.
                The Thucydidean Perikles, in his idealizing
                description of Athenian society, boasts that his
                fellow-citizens pay particular attention to those
                laws which are unwritten (agraphos: Thuc.
                2.37.3). Elsewhere we hear that Perikles was
                especially scrupulous to respect these unwritten
                laws which constituted the traditional culture
                and morality of Greek culture (Lys. 6.10). </font></p>

                Sophocles' <i>Antigone,</i> of course, turns upon
                the ambiguities of written law and on the
                overzealous legislation of an (initially at
                least) progressive leader. Creon begins by
                following the most enlightened and indeed radical
                strand of Greek political thought when he asserts
                that he will subordinate his own personal
                interests and affections to those of the
                city-state (Soph. Ant. 163-210), but he
                ultimately wilts before Antigone and her stubborn
                defense of &quot;unwritten laws&quot; (Soph. Ant.
                450ff.).[4] The play critiques modern ideas (esp.
                those of Protagoras) and the modern technology of
                writing at once.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Thucydides, the Athenian
                writer who did much to invent not only history
                but also the academic monograph, offers perhaps
                the most sustained and interesting example of
                that excitement which some Greeks felt for the
                new technology of his time. Herodotus published
                what may have been the first
                &quot;book-length&quot; prose work in the
                continuous tradition of Western tradition,[5] but
                Thucydides played D. W. Griffith to Herodotus'
                Edison, for, just as Griffith is credited with
                inventing film as a medium in its own right and
                not an imitation of stage, Thucydides produced a
                prose work that was conceived as a written
                document rather than a script for, or transcript
                of, performance. Thus, after a description of his
                methodology and of the pains that he took in
                collecting his data, Thucydides contrasts his
                work with that of his predecessors: &quot;The
                absence of romance in my history will, I fear,
                detract somewhat from its interest; but if it be
                judged useful by those inquirers who desire an
                exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the
                interpretation of the future, which in the course
                of human things must resemble if it does not
                reflect it, I shall be content. In fine, have
                written my work, not as an essay which is to win
                the applause of the moment, but as a possession
                for all time. (Thuc. 1.22.4)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thucydides did
                not write for performance -- perhaps to
                underscore this point, he wrote many passages
                that are so complex and impenetrable in language
                that ancient speakers of Greek (like Dionysius of
                Halikarnassos) could scarcely understand them.
                Thucydides wrote prose that needs to be studied
                and that no general audience could ever grasp
                from a single, oral performance. He defied the
                glibness of style and the laxness of method that
                he attributed to those who had gone before him,
                creating a refined prose work designed to
                withstand generations of close study. And in this
                he was spectacularly successful. Thucydides'
                History of the Peloponnesian War remains a staple
                not only in ancient history, but in political
                philosophy and international relations as well.
                Robert Strassler's 1996 Landmark edition of
                Thucydides,[6] undertaken as a labor of love by
                an investment banker, became an unexpected hit,
                striking a chord of interest that no one -- least
                of all Strassler -- had anticipated.</font></p>

                But if Thucydides affected an austerely
                intellectual rigor and refused to appeal to the
                popular culture of his time, he nevertheless saw
                in his written work the source for an emotional
                engagement that would exceed in intensity and
                outlast cheap sensationalism. The Funeral Oration
                which Thucydides attributes to Perikles presents
                an idealized vision of Athens. Perikles does not
                claim that Athenian temporal power would be
                permanent -- he does not even anticipate a
                thousand year Reich. He does, however, boast that
                Athens' reputation would never die. At the climax
                of his oration, delivered in honor of those who
                had died fighting Sparta and its allies (and the
                direct cultural ancestor of the Gettysburg
                Address[7]), Perikles articulates his vision of
                Athenian greatness: [2] For this offering of
                their lives made in common by them all they each
                of them individually received that renown which
                never grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so much
                that in which their bones have been deposited,
                but that noblest of shrines wherein their glory
                is laid up to be eternally remembered upon every
                occasion on which deed or story shall fall for
                its commemoration. [3] For heroes have the whole
                earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their
                own, where the column with its epitaph declares
                it, there is enshrined in every breast a record
                unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except
                that of the heart. (Thuc. 2.43)</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The above passage is
                remarkable for its apparent dismissal of writing.
                Athenian glory only has real existence insofar as
                it penetrates individual hearts and as real human
                beings emotionally embrace the memory of Athens.
                Written documents themselves are nothing. Human
                recognition -- and especially a recognition that
                includes heart as well as head -- is the only
                true form of glory.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless,
                there is no contradiction between the austerity
                of Thucydides' own rejection of sensationalism
                and the vision laid out by the Thucydidean
                Perikles. Athens' glory will endure over time and
                it will fire the minds of those who come after,
                but largely because Thucydides has composed, in
                cool written form, his best exposition of what
                really happened. The written history, subject to
                scrutiny and criticism for all time, would be the
                seed from which profound emotion would grow. And,
                indeed, this is precisely what has happened, for
                it is through Thucydides that we still must
                largely view the Athens of empire and democracy.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Thucydides'
                view, the austerity of his work was not so much a
                rejection of passion and emotion as it was a
                tactical retreat from sensationalism and a
                foundation for emotions that would be deeper and
                more firmly rooted. Thucydides, for all the dour
                realism that his writing affects, pursues an
                optimistic intellectual goal that is progressive
                in the truest sense of the word.</font></p>

                But if the methodology that Thucyides espouses in
                the opening of his history, the vision of Athens
                that his Perikles unfolds after one year of war,
                and even Athenian material power point towards a
                progressive vision of history, events themselves
                follow a more ambiguous course. Athens, the
                sea-power and financial center, falls to the
                supposedly obsolescent Sparta and its allies. A
                terrible plague claims Perikles among its
                victims, and venal leaders who cannot maintain
                Athenian greatness arise. The historian himself
                makes it clear that he can describe, but not
                assuage, such problems as plague (2.48.3) and the
                collapse into barbarium (3.82.2).</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Above all, the austere
                utilitarianism with which the (otherwise unknown)
                Diodotus prevents Athens from committing genocide
                at Mitylene degenerates into the brutal reasoning
                and pitiless slaughter on the island of Melos.
                Neither writing nor money -- two fundamental
                indices of fifth-century modernism and keys to
                Athenian culture -- could prevent a perceived
                social collapse as war dragged on for almost
                thirty years.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thucydides lived
                through a period of bitter disillusion that the
                British elites after the &quot;Great War&quot; or
                their American counterparts after Vietnam would
                quickly reckon. Plato spent his life trying to
                resolve the problems that Thucydides articulates
                in his history, above all the notion that
                &quot;might makes right&quot; and the justice is
                an ideological illusion. His greatest work, the <i>Republic</i>,
                takes its departure from the crass power politics
                and brutal realism that we find in Thucydides'
                Melian dialogue and establishes for justice a
                value that transcends any utilitarian measures.
                Born into the highest reaches of Athenian
                society, Plato grew up as the values which had
                defined his class weakened and an international,
                in many ways attractive, society, centuries old,
                seemed to be dissolving around him. The central
                problem for Plato was the same as that which
                ultimately confronted Thucydides: the technology
                and social &quot;progress&quot; of the fifth
                century failed to sustain itself. But where
                Thucydides was a grown man before war tore his
                world apart, Plato was born into a world of
                slaughter, plague and anxiety. He never
                experienced a &quot;Periklean age,&quot; where
                Athens, however anxious about the future,
                dominated the Greek world. He grew up among the
                intellectual wreckage of a &quot;lost
                generation.&quot; Plato, in other words,
                confronted a world readily comparable to that of
                the late twentieth century industrialized
                democracies.</font></p>

                Plato also exhibits a much more nuanced view of
                contemporary information technology than his
                older contemporary. Just as Plato, in the opening
                of the <i>Republic</i> recapitulates ideas about
                power politics that we find in Thucydides, he
                summarizes in the <i>Phaedrus</i> the same
                optimism that we can trace in the <i>Prometheus
                Bound</i> and in Thucydides. Plato's Socrates
                recounts the story of Theuth, an Egyptian
                Prometheus, who invented numbers and arithmetic
                and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and
                dice, and, most important of all, letters (Plat.
                Phaedr. 274d): </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The story goes that Thamus
                said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of
                the various arts, which it would take too long to
                repeat; but when they came to the letters,
                &quot;This invention, O king,&quot; said Theuth,
                &quot;will make the Egyptians wiser and will
                improve their memories; for it is a drug
                (pharmakon) of memory and wisdom that I have
                discovered.&quot; (Plat. Pheadr. 274e)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">This, of course,
                is essentially the same argument that we
                encountered in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>.
                Writing constitutes artificial memory and extends
                the range of human intelligence. It accompanies
                the other applied arts and that culture on which
                upon which these applied arts depend. Thucydides
                would apply this notion far more subtly,
                demonstrating in his history concretely how a
                scientific, written account of events could
                immortalize the events of his time and extend the
                subsequent memory of humankind. Plato, however,
                only introduces the conventional boasts of
                writing so that the Egyptian king Thamus can
                critique them:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">But Thamus
                replied, &quot;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has
                the ability to beget arts, but the ability to
                judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their
                users belongs to another; [275a] and now you, who
                are the father of letters, have been led by your
                affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite
                of that which they really possess. For this
                invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds
                of those who learn to use it, because they will
                not practice their memory. Their trust in
                writing, produced by external characters which
                are no part of themselves, will discourage the
                use of their own memory within them. You have
                invented a drug (pharmakon) not of memory, but of
                reminding; and you offer your pupils the
                appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they
                will read many things without instruction and
                will therefore seem [275b] to know many things,
                when they are for the most part ignorant and hard
                to get along with, since they are not wise, but
                only appear wise. (Plat. Phaedr. 274e-275a)</font></p>

                Jacques Derrida made this passage of the Phaedrus
                famous in literary studies: the ambiguities of
                the Greek word are very similar to those of Greek
                pharmakon, and Derrida was able to use the issues
                involved here to help dramatize the ambiguities
                of language. This paragraph, for all its apparent
                simplicity, is extremely dense, alluding
                backwards to a range of themes from earlier Greek
                literature, while at the same time anticipating
                the fundamental objection to modern media. On the
                one hand, writing externalizes knowledge, giving
                that knowledge an existence outside the human
                brain and thus allowing that knowledge to outlive
                frail biological wetware, but knowledge
                externalized, available on demand for casual
                access, never wholly absorbed or internalized in
                any one mind, becomes information -- a commodity
                that anyone can acquire -- rather than knowledge,
                much less wisdom -- the studied and cultivated
                ability to apply knowledge judiciously. Plato is
                directly attacking that optimism that we can see
                in Thucydides, but the attack is tactical rather
                than strategic. Thucydides envisions a world in
                which his austere written history will excite
                human wonder and passion. Plato looks to a world
                of couch potatoes who cannot remember what passed
                through their minds a day before and of slick
                consultants who market a veneer of expertise.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Thucydides and Plato
                differ in their emphases: Thucydides, for all the
                overt pessimism that runs through much of his
                history, in his practices implies an optimism
                over the value, if not the utility, of written
                history: whether or not we learn from the past to
                control the future, we can lose ourselves in the
                reasoned contemplation of Athens and its
                struggles. Plato focuses instead upon the effect
                of writing as artificial memory, as knowledge
                disembodied from the human brain. If Plato
                focuses upon the negative consequences of writing
                and thus pushes in a direction different from
                that of Thucydides, the contrast emerges
                precisely because both writers share the same
                values: each measures the value of writing
                according to the impact that it has upon the
                reader.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">The shared values
                of Thucydides and Plato animate the best of the
                critique aimed against information technology,
                twenty five hundred years ago and today. But, of
                course, any argument about technology derives its
                force from some larger context, in this case the
                general purpose of education. Two attitudes have
                contended furiously for as long as we can trace
                arguments about education. According to one
                position, conventionally associated with Plato,
                knowledge has value in and of itself. This
                argument can take an abstract form in which some
                transcendent Truth, perhaps scientific, perhaps
                philosophical, perhaps religious, is the source
                of all value. Conversely, this argument can be
                relentlessly practical: education is valuable
                because it produces useful knowledge, i.e.,
                knowledge that allows us to better master our
                environment, to preserve or restore our health,
                to satisfy our physical needs and appetites of
                all kinds etc. These two variations of this
                attitude are, of course, generally related --
                they struggle ceaselessly, for example, within
                the US National Science Foundation, as the
                proponents of basic and applied science compete
                for resources. Nevertheless, for the pure
                mathematician and the engineer, information
                technology -- writing, print, electronic storage
                -- is essential because it allows us to create
                shared structures of knowledge far greater than
                any one brain could encompass.</font></p>

                According to the second attitude, education has
                value not so much because of the knowledge that
                it produces as because of the impact that it
                exerts upon human character. This position, like
                its counterpart, has both an abstract and an
                applied wing. All systems for the perfection of
                human character, whether the Christian quest for
                salvation, the Confucian drive towards
                self-improvement or the Buddhist yearning for
                transcendence, order the disparate impulses and
                conditions of human life in a grand quest for
                some transcendent project. In its more applied
                form, this education leads to a republican
                rhetorical tradition in which neither abstract
                truth nor even, contrary to general perception,
                short term successes are the object.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The republican rhetorical
                tradition has little to do with bamboozling
                yokels; it assumes, instead, a contest of words
                and eloquence among equals, all of whom quickly
                learn the cheap tricks of argumentation and who,
                as a group, set de facto standards for discourse.
                The republican rhetorical tradition, from
                Perikles and Cicero to Lincoln and Churchill,
                challenges its practitioners to perfect their
                command of language and their understanding of
                the values which their fellows share. Such
                speakers depend for the success both upon the
                eloquence of what they say and upon the moral
                authority which they accumulate over time. At
                their best, they redefine their societies,
                winning consent for bold ideas and for shared
                efforts that renew and invigorate their
                societies. Promulgating drivel or barbarism may
                succeed in the short term but ultimately
                undermines the republican system, leading to
                chaos or an authoritarian society, both of which
                squelch the rough give-and-take among political
                peers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, there
                are few who purely embody either position, but
                Plato is remarkable precisely because he manages
                at once to champion both education as the source
                for truth and as the engine for moral perfection.
                (Post-modern society, conversely, comes to close
                to rejecting both, insofar as it dismisses
                notions of transcendent truth and undercuts any
                notion of moral perfection.) The arguments that
                swirl about the transformation of the book depend
                largely upon the dichotomy between these two
                attitudes. Those who most enthusiastically
                champion new technology often do so because their
                eyes have fixed upon the expanded edifice of
                knowledge that we can construct in this brave new
                digital world. Whether their visions focus more
                upon the beauty of a vast new shared society of
                knowledge or upon the material benefits to
                society (or themselves) that such new knowledge
                may bring, for them artificial memory and,
                ultimately, artificial intelligence are
                attractive precisely because they separate
                elements of intellection from the warm tissues of
                the human body.</font></p>

                We humanists, insofar as we are humanists, belong

                of our own time. None of these categories is, in
                practice, absolute. Those of us who study past
                cultures must also contribute to our knowledge of
                the subject, while our colleagues in science and
                engineering believe that character and intellect
                must develop together. If we in the humanities do
                not passionately explore our fields, then we are
                not true humanists but priests of a static dogma.
                If scientists and engineers do not develop moral
                or rhetorical skills, they will become corrupt or
                ineffective. Nevertheless, the federal government
                does not invest vast sums of money into
                scientific research to develop character or to
                foster civic republicanism, and the production of
                knowledge in the humanities matters only insofar
                as it affects, directly or indirectly, the
                undergraduate curriculum or some audience beyond
                the specialists. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Digital libraries have
                captured the imagination of researchers in
                classics, old and young, conservative and
                radical, for over a generation: after receiving
                the endorsement of an international body of
                scholars, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) at
                UC Irvine began in 1972 to build a database of
                all early Greek literature -- for us, the TLG
                allows us to explore our core data in ways that
                had been physically impossible and, insofar as we
                value the production of knowledge, we have long
                admired the TLG and its electronically
                transmogrified books. Nevertheless, the real
                value of this new technology lies less in how it
                enhances our research and the sheltered
                conversation of specialist with specialist as it
                allows us to redefine the relationship between
                researchers and the rest of the world. We need to
                ask two basic questions, one quantitative, the
                other qualitative: what effect does the new
                technology have on the raw number of those
                intellectually engaged with antiquity (or in any
                area of the humanities) and on the quality of
                that engagement. If no one were to study some
                area in the humanities except specialists, then
                the game is up for that area and its days as
                identifiable sub-discipline are probably
                numbered. On the other hand, it is not clear what
                value we offer if we worry only about engaging
                non-specialists and reduce ourselves to
                entertainment: if we subordinate ourselves wholly
                to popular tastes and do not challenge our
                audience to rise above the passivity of network
                television or even mass produced weekly
                magazines, then we may add to the quantity of
                content available but we will become just another
                category of programming. Our goal must be to
                demonstrate that culture extends beyond the
                market-driven popular culture of our time and
                that even the Discovery Channel and Time Magazine
                constitute can do no more than arouse interest in
                larger topics that require more extensive
                thought.</font></p>

                The quantitative argument is easy to address. A
                reasonably successful academic publication might
                sell 1,000 copies, most of which will normally
                sit unused in university libraries or faculty
                offices. The potential audience on the Internet
                is at least 10,000,000 machines, four orders of
                magnitude larger -- since the average sales of
                academic publications is certainly not rising and
                the number of people with access to the World
                Wide Web is certainly not shrinking, this ratio
                is going to increase during the foreseeable
                future. But even if only an infinitesimal
                percentage of machines ever visit any given site,
                the number can readily dwarf that of print: as of
                fall 1997, the WWW version of the Perseus digital
                library on ancient Greco-Roman culture attracts
                upwards of 7,000 visitors per day. Only half of
                the identifiable Internet addresses come from
                higher education (*.edu). A survey of the access
                logs and of the mail that we receive makes it
                clear that we are not only reaching conventional
                academics but grade school children and adult
                learners resuscitating their knowledge of Greek
                and Latin. We are reaching office parks, rural
                homes, schools, and even military installations.
                We have users not only in Europe and the English
                speaking world, but in Japan and South America --
                where students of Greco-Roman culture had had
                little contact with experts on North America and
                Europe. Virtually nothing that we, as academics,
                publish will find its way into the Walden Books
                chains or the general school and public library
                system. Everything that we now publish freely on
                the Web is immediately available in a substantial
                percentage of classrooms, public libraries and
                homes. But, of course, simply making available
                documents designed for a print medium and written
                by professors for other professors will not get
                us very far. Redesigning our publications so that
                they can reach this wider audience is the major
                challenge that confronts the next generation of
                humanists.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">But
                as soon as we focus on adapting ourselves to this
                new audience so that we can promote the
                quantitative increases in our audience that all
                of us in the humanities desperately need, we must
                decide on what our audience will be and what kind
                of experience we hope to foster.[8] The greatest
                danger here is transferring habits of thought and
                usage that are the products of print technology
                into an electronic environment with different
                constraints and possibilities.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology, even
                when revolutionary, generally has an immediate
                impact upon the tactical decisions that we make
                (e.g., how to manage a ship powered by coal
                rather than wind) and it may ultimately have
                strategic implications (e.g., the need to
                maintain a world wide network of coaling bases)
                but it need not affect the overall goals involved
                (e.g., control of the sea). Writing made possible
                the historical study of literature, qualitatively
                changing the way in which we could interact with
                the distant past. Subsequent advances in
                information technology such as the codex,
                printing and electronic systems have
                revolutionized the way in which we study
                literatures of the past, but the Alexandrian
                scholars of the third century BCE, transported to
                the early twentieth century library of congress
                or a digital library project would quickly
                recognize what their later colleagues were doing.

                Nevertheless, if the possibilities of a new
                technology allow us to redefine how we go about
                pursuing our larger goals and indeed to rethink
                which ideal goals we can reasonably pursue, then
                we must look for the constraints of a prior
                technology that we have internalized into our
                present work lest we confuse bugs in the system
                with features. Classicists, for example, rarely
                write anything for a wide audience: the
                university presses that have published our major
                ideas as books and brokered our careers prod us
                to write for a general audience, but, in
                classics, this largely means that we translate
                the Greek and Latin, reduce our footnotes, and
                explain some of our ideas -- all fairly
                superficial changes. Of course, we have very
                little reason to change the way that we write:
                virtually no one outside the academy will ever
                see any of our publications and our real audience
                consists of our colleagues in classics or (if we
                are very ambitious) one or more adjacent academic
                specialties (e.g., philosophers who have an
                interest in Plato). But many of us, enmeshed in
                the system of publication, tenure, promotion and
                the parochial recognition of our peers, not only
                overlook the fact that such isolation renders our
                field untenable in the long run but even perceive
                our isolation not as a terrible weakness and
                danger to our field but as a sign of our
                intellectual rigor and purity. Throughout
                academia, the communities that we establish
                become hostile enclaves, their inhabitants eager
                to drive out anyone not fluent in the local
                patois. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The
                study of classical literature -- and this holds
                true for classical literatures in China, India,
                and the Islamic world -- introduces its audience
                into a complex, interlocking network of
                documents. First, reading classical
                literatures--Greco-Roman, Chinese,
                Islamic--requires mastery of a demanding language
                no longer in current usage, but this linguistic
                mastery, challenging as it may be, constitutes
                only the initiation into a textual world that may
                be small in size -- all of Greco-Roman literature
                can be stored in a single large book-case &#150;
                but that no human being can fully master. Second,
                classical literatures that have flourished and
                elicited study over centuries generally rely upon
                a core of exceptionally successful works that
                accomplish two radically distinct, and often
                opposed, goals at once. On the one hand, they can
                appeal to those with little knowledge of the
                field -- Homer, Greek Tragedy and Plato, for
                example, continue to be read in English by
                audiences with little knowledge of ancient Greek
                culture; Latin literature may not have quite the
                same appeal in English translation, but high
                school students continue to struggle through
                authors such as Vergil and Cicero.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Students can
                encounter these works at an early age and enjoy
                them -- I learned early on in my teaching career
                from student evaluations, for example, that
                whatever my audience thought of my lecture style,
                ideas, exams, grading etc., they almost
                invariably came to enjoy and admire Greek drama.
                Nevertheless, these works can be read and reread
                throughout a lifetime: a reader intellectually
                engaged in the <i>Iliad </i>or the <i>Republic</i>
                can take away new insights from each fresh
                reading from the age of seventeen through
                advanced age.</font></p>

                Third, classical literatures are cumulative: each
                time that we devote a major effort to mastering
                any one author, we enhance our understanding of
                many other texts as well. This is certainly true
                about any literature -- the more we know about
                the cultural and literary context, the more ways
                in which we can view an individual work. The more
                we know about Homer, the better we can understand
                not only Vergil but Plato as well, each of whom
                wrote in the shadow of the <i>Iliad </i>and the <i>Odyssey</i>.
                The Homeric Epics stand at the beginning of
                European literature and have no surviving
                antecedents, but the more we learn about archaic
                society, the better we can understand these poems
                as well. Professional classicists can expect to
                increase their intellectual range, studying new
                texts for the first time, rereading well known
                authors with wholly new sets of questions, and
                tangibly deepening the experience of reading any
                given text. Some texts, such as the Homeric Epics
                or Greek Drama, are so rich and complex that
                sensitive readers can study them from childhood
                to old age and still continue to learn something
                with each rereading. Even before vast bodies of
                information and ideas from archaeology, literary
                theory, anthropology, sociology, art history,
                cognitive science, linguistics and other
                disciplines were available to challenge and
                transform the way that we study these texts, we
                had more than enough to support the life of the
                mind from childhood onwards.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Insofar as we only reach
                students from the ages of roughly eighteen to
                twenty-one, we are not living up to our larger
                mission. We need, of course, to teach students to
                think and to prepare them for their work in later
                life, but we must never confuse this aspect of
                our task with the task as a whole -- our students
                (and their parents) already worry far too much
                about where they will be at twenty-five or thirty
                and not nearly enough about where they will be at
                forty, sixty or eighty. Ideally, we are providing
                our students with a foundation of knowledge upon
                which they can draw throughout their lives. Our
                students may well have little time in the years
                after they graduate for much besides establishing
                their careers and establishing families, but most
                will, sooner or later, begin to hunger for
                something beyond their daily lives. The BA in
                classics may later develop an interest in
                twentieth century Latin American literature or
                Japanese Film, but reading Homer should provide
                that BA with a sense of how to engage artistic
                creations in a disciplined fashion. Conversely,
                we need to be able to support an interest in our
                fields that arises long after college.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Book culture has
                served professional academics and intellectuals
                well -- or at least those who have access to
                major libraries -- but it has had much more
                limited success in helping a wider audience
                cultivate sustained interests over a long period
                of time. Public libraries, book clubs, mall
                bookstore chains and other outlets can only do so
                much. It is simply impracticable for most of
                those outside of a university environment to
                cultivate sustained areas of interest -- nowhere
                outside of academia is that depth of print
                information available that can satisfy or
                stimulate a voracious interest in most subjects.
                A curious twelve year old living in an affluent
                suburb with a model public library can quickly
                exhaust its traditional printed resources on
                Human Evolution or Inner Asian History. Her
                thoughtful fifty-two year old compatriot may
                simply not have the time in her schedule to visit
                a library with any regularity. The growth of
                cable programming on history and science reflects
                the frustrated hunger for ideas and the
                limitations of the traditional print library in
                isolation.</font></p>

                for example, see signs of a revolutionary change
                in one core area of classics. However well our
                students may learn classical languages in their
                student days, they have traditionally had little
                prospect of retaining these skills later in life,
                when their careers and family obligations allow
                them to broaden their interests and when they are
                often hungry to read works such as the Iliad or
                the Republic again. When our former students wish
                to return to Plato or Vergil, their linguistic
                knowledge has receded and they lack the support
                system to work their way through the language.
                Now, however, we provide not only raw access to
                many Greek and Latin texts on the World Wide Web
                but, more importantly, links between source texts
                and reading aids of various kinds, including
                lexica, grammars, commentaries, and morphological
                analyses of individual words. In some cases, we
                make faster and more widely available functions
                that could be done in a library or if the reader
                had assembled a bookshelf full of reference
                works.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">In
                other cases, we allow readers to perform
                functions or ask questions that have never before
                been possible. While a great deal remains to be
                done, we have already been able to transform the
                way in which those beyond the academy can
                interact with Greek and Latin literature.
                Already, we have begun to hear from former
                classics majors who never expected to read Greek
                or Latin again and who are now able to consider
                resuscitating their knowledge. At the same time,
                we can now begin to tell our students that the
                work which they do at twenty will serve them
                again at forty or seventy. By changing the
                relationship between our core texts and the wider
                public, we change the value that these texts have
                for our traditional full-time students.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman">Millions of
                people may not develop a passionate interest in
                Greek and Latin language in the immediate future,
                but numbers are not the point, since the example
                of classical languages could be replicated
                throughout the intellectual world Every
                discipline in the humanities has functions that
                books can only imperfectly support. Printed
                illustrations are very expensive: it is extremely
                difficult to study art from books because there
                are never enough pictures or enough details. Nor
                have the weaknesses of print publication enhanced
                the value of the original objects -- in
                developing a visual database of Greek art we grew
                accustomed to curators fearful that digital
                images, if too good, could lower interest in the
                originals. All of our experience to date
                indicates that the opposite is true: the better
                the published documentation and the fuller the
                pictures, the greater the interest in the
                original. This is the positive side of the
                &quot;papparazzo principle.&quot; </font></p>

                Our greatest goal as intellectuals is to create a
                seamless web of knowledge so that the curious may
                pursue their interests as far their will and
                ability take them, rather than as far as
                traditional print publication has allowed. The
                viewer captivated by Branagh's Hamlet should be
                able to compare Branagh's Hamlet with that of
                Olivier and Zefferelli, survey the kinds of
                questions experts on the play have raised, even
                compare the First Folio edition with the version
                of the play as adopted in a given performance.
                The technical barriers to such a seamless Web of
                knowledge are relatively modest. Simple access to
                academic publications now safely ensconced in
                research libraries will have little affect
                because these publications were written by
                specialists and for specialists. We must think
                long and hard about how we write, cultivating
                ways to make our ideas more readily accessible to
                an open-minded and interested public. Some ideas
                may be too complex, but often jargon and academic
                short-hand needlessly obscure our main points.
                Most publications may address minutiae and points
                of little general applicability, but the core
                issues that we are exploring and a large body of
                data should be readily accessible. Such a finely
                designed Web of knowledge would indeed help both
                the general public and researchers. As one
                colleague observed, describing the function of an
                astrolabe in terms comprehensible to a twelve
                year old made the description more useful for
                non-specialist scholars unfamiliar with
                astrolabers.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">As a humanist, I see
                little to lose from a electronic media. We have,
                like medieval monks in their monasteries,
                cultivated and maintained a magnificent culture
                of learning in our universities, but it is our
                obligation to seize upon every means at our
                disposal not only to help our own research but
                also to reach that wider audience. Artificial
                dichotomies between paper and electronic media
                only distract us from the question of who does
                what. As a classicist, I know full well that
                print did not create a new kind of textuality
                that was qualitatively superior to what went
                before but allowed the experience of textuality
                to reach more people than scribal culture ever
                could. We may smile at the &quot;sweatness and
                light&quot; that Matthew Arnold saw at the core
                of intellectual life -- we are more apt to
                challenge conventional pieties and focus upon
                uncomfortable truths -- and we certainly have a
                much broader range of interests than those of
                Arnold's Oxford, but our mission is the same: to
                reach out and communicate our ideas -- and,
                equally important, our passionate engagement with
                those ideas to the widest possible audience. Our
                work has barely begun: while our large goals --
                to increase knowledge and to communicate what we
                have learned -- may not change, we must, in the
                years to come, rethink every aspect of our work. </font></p>
