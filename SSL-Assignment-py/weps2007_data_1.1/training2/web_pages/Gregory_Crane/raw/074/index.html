Accurately identifying the scene as "intensely political,"[<a href="karass.an.htm#fn1">1</a><a name="m1"></a>]     the author builds his analysis of Agamemnon’s action based on the assumption     that previous analyses have failed to identify correctly the Athenian mistrust     of wealth and the complex role wealth plays in Athenian politics. Utilizing     the point-counterpoint method at the beginning of his analysis and a brief     sampling of the cultural history of the carpet, Crane successfully refutes     views contrary to his own and demonstrates to the reader the plausibility     of his beliefs.</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">For his point of entry into his analysis, Crane chooses to look     specifically at the material worth of the carpet and how its monetary value     symbolically affected Athenian society. The cultural information included     by the author enhances the audience’s understanding of carpet’s incredible     monetary and social worth. Crane makes a point of explaining to readers that     the rug is "expensive not simply because it is embroidered, but because…the     dye porphyra was extremely expensive, and purple cloth signified great wealth."[<a href="karass.an.htm#fn2">2</a><a name="m2"></a>]     The author’s antidote impresses upon the audience the fact that those who     possessed carpet in ancient Athens were elite. After analyzing the relationship     between the purple carpet and Athens’ elite, Crane proposes that Agamemnon’s     carpet is actually a symbol for wealth and prestige. </p>  <p align="left">Yet, in order to grasp the relevance of the symbol when applied     to the political life in Athens, the author returns to the social history     of Athens. At the time, Aeschylus wrote the play, Crane believes the middle     and lower class Athenians were suspicious "of material symbols of wealth and     prestige." [<a href="karass.an.htm#fn3">3</a><a name="m3"></a>] According to the author,     the Carpet Scene documents the distrust when Agamemon hesitates stepping on     the carpet after Klytmnestra’s repeated urgings. Instead of using his wealth     (i.e. stepping on the carpet) for a good purpose such as hospitality, Agamemnon     "destroys the expensive cloth for no useful purpose."[<a href="karass.an.htm#fn4">4</a><a name="m4"></a>]     Ultimately, Agaememnon’s hesitation to walk on the carpet symbolizes the great     distrust Athenian’s held toward material goods and their use in non-purposeful     ways.</p>  <p align="left">Sensing a general mistrust emanating from the population, the     wealthy elite curbed the growing suspicion by using their resources philanthropically.     Immediately, the generosity of the elite enabled Athenian political life to     stabilize. Crane views the contributions, "the fitting out of a trireme or     the productions of tragedies," [<a href="karass.an.htm#fn5">5</a><a name="m5"></a>] of     the wealthy as the factor that sustained political life in Athens. The wealthy     also realized the power of monetary resources, and utilized their philanthropic     ventures to stall any movement within the social ranks. The Carpet Scene,     the carpet, Clytemnestra urging, and Agamemnon’s hesitation according to the     author serve as commentary on the current political life in Athens, the necessity     of the philanthropy, and the apparent anti-elitist views held by all classes.</p>  <p align="left">Crane provides a firm analysis that is clear and easy to navigate.     Even if the views his examination espouses ring false, the author’s claims     draw support from the smattering of Athenian history he provides and evidence     from the text. Compared to the traditional ideas produced by previous analyses,     the author’s ideas draw attention to a significant historical aspect of Athenian     politics. In short, Crane points to Carpet Scene as a "brilliant, but partial,     vision of what Athens could be."
