            <P><span class="blackprint">Medford, MA, January 11, 1999</span>- The second annual 
              Tufts University Berger Family Technology Award was bestowed on 
              The Electronic Bolles Archives on the History and Topography of 
              London: Phase I submitted by an interdisciplinary team of Gregory 
              Colati, Gregory Crane, Carol Flynn, Rob Jacobs and Holly Taylor. 
              The award culminates a competitive proposal process and provides 
              funding of $42,000.00. The Berger Family established the endowment 
              to retrain library staff to function in the increasingly high technology 
              digital library and also to prepare students and faculty to effectively 
              use technology. It is believed that the endowment is the first of 
              its kind to train library staff and faculty in new technology.</P>
            <P>The Bolles collection is one of the outstanding holdings 
              in the University's Special Collections used both in teaching and 
              research. The Electronic Bolles Archives begins to digitize and 
              electronically publish the Bolles collection on the Web so it will 
              reach a much larger audience while reducing the wear and tear on 
              the collection. The project will digitize the collection's London 
              maps from 1762 through 1895 and link them to each other using Geographic 
              Information Systems technology so that the user can virtually walk 
              the streets of London seeing them as they were in different time 
              periods. Edwin Bolles, a former Chaplain at Tufts, assembled a substantial 
              collection of maps, books, pamphlets and images manually linked 
              to a 3,000 page bibliography, Walter Thornbury's Old and new London, 
              a narrative of its history, its people and its places (London, New 
              York, Cassell, Peter & Galpin [1872]. The project will provide new 
              teaching and research opportunities for a Tufts University interdisciplinary 
              team made up of the following members:</P>
            <P><span class="blackprint">Gregory Colati</span>, the University Archivist who 
              is also responsible for Special Collections, has implemented electronic 
              processing of archival material to simultaneously create Web entries 
              and internal online registers. He along with Greg Crane will be 
              in charge of overseeing the day-to-day work on the project.</P>
            <P><span class="blackprint">Gregory Crane</span>, Professor of Classics and Winnick 
              Family Professor of Technology and Entrepreneurship, has a long 
              standing interest in the design of digital libraries for the humanities 
              and the application of GIS. His Perseus project will provide much 
              of the technical infrastructure for the project.</P>
            <P><span class="blackprint">Carol Flynn</span>, Professor of English, teaches 
              courses that explore the relationship between the city of London 
              and English literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. She is also 
              writing a book on representations of eighteenth century London and 
              the construction of early modern urban space. Carol and the other 
              collaborators will provide advice and guidance throughout the project.</P>
            <P><span class="blackprint">Rob Jacobs</span>, Associate Professor in Electrical 
              Engineering and Computer Science, works on computer human interaction. 
              He will design the initial project interface with a goal of relating 
              the rich and complex data in a seamless fashion.</P>
            <P><span class="blackprint">Holly Taylor</span>, Assistant Professor Psychology, 
              does research in the areas of text comprehension and spatial cognition. 
              In this project, she will study the effect of linking geographic 
              information to literary texts and of different interfaces into the 
              geographic data.</P>
            <P>The specific technology transfer goals of the Electronic 
              Bolles Archive project are:</P>
            <OL>
              <LI>The Special Collections department will learn how to create 
                TEI conformant SGML facsimile editions of its material. They will 
                also learn how to utilize geographic information systems technology 
                in general and the GIS Center is the Tisch Library in particular.</LI>
              <LI>The project team will run a series of workshop/presentations 
                on various aspects of the project. This will include technical 
                issues (e.g., particulars of scanning and formatting) and broader 
                topics (e.g., how the Bolles Electronic Archives supports teaching 
                and research in humanities, social sciences and engineering. These 
                workshops will be aimed at Tisch Library staff, the Tufts community 
                and interested members of the Boston Library Consortium.</LI>
            </OL>

              of the Libraries Board of Overseers, Tufts University; Mel Bernstein, 
              Vice President, Arts, Sciences & Technology; Ioannis Miaoulsi, Dean 
              of Engineering; Susan Ernst, Dean of Natural & Social Sciences; 
              Leila Fawaz, Dean of Arts & Humanities; Klaus Miczek, Chair of the

                A celebratory dinner is also planned in November 1999 to honor 
                the Electronic Bolles Archives team, who will report on the results 
                of their project tot he Advisory Board. The result of all awarded 
                projects will be submitted for publication to professional journals, 
                as well as be highlighted in Tufts print and electronic publications.</P>
