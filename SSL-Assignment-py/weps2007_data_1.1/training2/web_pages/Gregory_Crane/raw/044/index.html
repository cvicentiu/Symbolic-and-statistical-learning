Electronic Text." <I>Current Anthropology</I> (1991) 32:

293-311.</H4>

</UL>In this article Gregory Crane examines the ways in which the

capabilities of a particular medium--print, sound and video

recordings, electronic text--determine the questions readers ask

and the issues they decide to pursue. Printed text, Crane

asserts, has as one of its chief sources of authority the

"tyranny of tedium," which has effectively circumscribed the

intellectual range of scholarly enquiry. Use of audio-visual

information would expand this range, but scholars resist it as a

new and unfamiliar medium that is difficult to cite. Crane draws

on his own experience with students using the <I>Perseus</I>

multimedia database ("Interactive Sources and Studies on Ancient

Greece"), arguing that readers quickly adapt to the capabilities

of a new medium, probing new areas and making connections not

possible (or likely) through print resources. The case Crane

makes for hypertext overlaps in many respects with that made by

George P. Landow in <I>Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary

Critical Theory and Technology</I> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP,

1992). For those who have read Landow, the primary interest of

Crane's article might be in the application of hypertext in the

social sciences, specifically in the creation of ethnographies,

and in Crane's distinction between "writing culture" and

"composing culture." <B>(Sarah Wadsworth.)</B>
