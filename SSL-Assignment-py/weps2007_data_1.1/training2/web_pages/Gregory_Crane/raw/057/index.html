The Melbern G. Glasscock Center for Humanities Research at Texas A&amp;M 
University is pleased to announce the third lecture in its continuing 
Humanities Informatics series.

Gregory Crane, Professor of Classics at Tufts University and 
Editor-in-Chief of The Perseus Project  will be lecturing on &quot;Humanities 
and Information Technology&quot; at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday 23 April 2003 in Room 
204E of the Sterling C. Evans Library.

Gregory Crane is the author of The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New 
Written Word (1996) and The Ancient Simplicity: Thucydides and the Limits 
of Political Realism (1998).  He currently directs a major grant from the 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dli2.nsf.gov">http://www.dli2.nsf.gov</A>&gt;Digital Library Initiative to study general 
problems of digital libraries in the humanities. He is also at work 
refining the classical collections in the Perseus Project, &quot;an evolving 
digital library, engineering interactions through time, space, and 
language&quot; that aims to bring an array of source materials - from 
collections on ancient Egypt to those on the American Civil War - to as 
many people as possible.  He is deeply committed to creating new audiences 
outside the university for all sorts of cultural materials, and part of his 
ongoing research focuses on &quot;computational humanities&quot;and how this new 
field can help to democratize information without compromising intellectual 
quality.

We hope to see you there.
