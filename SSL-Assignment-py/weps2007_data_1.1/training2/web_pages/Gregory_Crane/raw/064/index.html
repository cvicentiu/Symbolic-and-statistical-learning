<h3>Weeks 9B and 10 (Arms): Changes in scholarship and research</h3>

<p>This section examines the topic, how is digital information changing the methods
  of scholarship and research. 
<p>On Wednesday, March 29, Gregory Crane from Tufts University is giving
  a <a href = "http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/about/colloquiumSP06/march29.html">colloquium</a>
   on the subject, &quot;What do you do with a million books?&quot; We will explore
   ideas that build on this seminar in the classes on Thursday, March 29, Tuesday,  April
4, and Thursday, April 13.
<p>The center of Professor Crane's work is the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus
Digital Library</a>.

<p><em>Tuesday, April 4: Appreciating Pindar </em></p>
<p>When he began work on Perseus, Professor Crane was in the Classics department
  at Harvard University. One of his objectives was to help modern students understand
  the poetry of the Greek poet Pindar. Pindar was considered one of the greatest
poets of his era, which most of us find hard to understand. </p>
<p>The problems go
  far beyond not being able to read classical Greek. To a modern audience, the
  subject and style of his poetry is puzzling: the subject of his work is
  commercially-oriented short poems praising contemporary or recent Greeks; the
  structure is convoluted and the images formulaic. How can we get away from
  our modern viewpoints and understand the cultural context in which Pindar
flourished? </p>
<p>Before the class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select one of Pindar's poems and read it (in translation).</li>
  <li><strong>Write a one page summary and mail it to the course
      team</strong> (before noon on
    Tuesday). Who is the poem about and why is he celebrated? What is the structure
    of the poem? What images, metaphors, etc. are used?</li>
</ul>
    <p>In class, we will discuss the tools that Perseus provides to study texts,
such as these poems.</p>

    <p><em>Thursday, April 6: Changing Libraries, Changing Research</em></p>
    <p>This will be a discussion class on the relationship between libraries
      and research. There is an inter-relationship between the structure of libraries
      and the form of research that they enable. New technology enables new forms
      of library and new forms of research. We need to consider
      what happens when the user of a library is a computer program, which is
      acting as agent for a researcher. Here are three examples: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> The <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus Digital Library</a>. </li>
      <li>The National Library of Medicine's <a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>. </li>
      <li><a href = "http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february06/arms/02arms.html">Cornell's
        Web Library</a>.  See: Arms, W., Aya, S., Dmitriev, P., Kot, B.,
        Mitchell, R., Walle, L., A Research Library based on the Historical Collections
        of the Internet Archive. <em>D-Lib Magazine</em>, February 2006.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before the class, skim these three examples. Can you find others? </p>
