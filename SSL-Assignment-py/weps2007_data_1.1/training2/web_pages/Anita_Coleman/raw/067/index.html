<p>Over the past decade there have been many new initiatives in scholarly
communication, digital libraries, and the development of educational, scientific
and cultural heritage institutions with significant commitments to online
resources and online services. For instance, preprint services have transformed
the practices of some research communities such as high energy physics
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Ginsparg01">Ginsparg 2001</a>). Other disciplinary communities
such as earth science (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Domenicoetal02">Domenico <i>et al</i>.
2002</a>), biology (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Bowker01">Bowker 2001</a>), and neuroscience
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Amarietal02">Amari <i>et al</i>. 2002</a>) are focusing on the
development of library collections and services aimed at providing real
time and archival data to support the conduct of science and sharing of
scientific results. Within the United States, new forms of educational
institutions, such as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) program,
are aiming to transform primary, secondary and tertiary science education
through the provision of educational digital library collections and services
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Wattenberg98">Wattenberg 1998</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Zia01">Zia 2001</a>).
Within the NSDL, a rich array of innovative services not traditionally
associated with bricks-and-mortar libraries are being developed to support
teaching and learning practices, not just information access. These include
services supporting personalized content delivery, services for creating
digital resources, and communication and collaboration services, to name
just a few (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#NSDL03">NSDL 2003</a>).
<p>The diverse approaches are encompassed under the broad heading of
digital library or digital repository initiatives. Yet, each community
is embracing different suites of technologies and using them in very different
ways. <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Kling-McKim00">Kling and McKim (2000)</a> note that field
differences in the selection and use of digital library and scholarly communication
media are not surprising. They describe how large-scale social shaping
processes, taking place over many years, influence the selection of new
information technologies by scientific and academic disciplines. New technologies
are selected very differently based on the community's disciplinary tradition,
historical practices, and current ways of working.
<p>As such, social shaping perspectives highlight the critical role that
practices, i.e. work practices, social networking practices, and other
culturally shaped behaviors, play in influencing technology use and adoption.
Indeed, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Lynch03">Lynch (2003)</a> argues that the future of digital
libraries lies not in supporting generic, broadly useful services such
as information access to large collections and knowledge stores, but in
supporting "customization by community", i.e. the development of services
tailored to support the specific, and real, practices of different user
constituencies. Similarly, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Borgman99">Borgman (1999)</a> defines
digital libraries as being constructed by and for a community of users,
with
functionalities specifically designed to support their particular information
needs.
<p>These insights and definitions are not new. In the early 1990s Project
ENVISION attempted to build a prototype digital library of computer science
literature by studying user needs of computer science professionals over
a four month period. They articulated task-oriented access as an important
principle for digital library development (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Foxetal93">Fox <i>et
al</i>. 1993</a>). Project CORE, which stands for the Chemistry Online
Retrieval Experiment, was a unique collaboration of many different types
of organizations: the American Chemical Society (a learned society), Chemical Abstracts Service
(indexing and bibliographic database publisher), Bellcore (a technology
research lab), Cornell University and OCLC (a bibliographic utility). They tried to build the chemist's
workstation wherein information discovery, browsing, searching, and task-oriented
access were enabled through a single, seamless, unified interface. In recent
years, instances of such community-based digital libraries are taking hold
in a wider variety of settings and disciplines, ranging from K-12 mathematics
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Math-Forum">Math Forum</a>), Earth system science (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Marlinoetal01">Marlino
<i>et
al</i>. 2001</a>), and higher education (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#MERLOT">MERLOT</a>).
<p>Within the landscape of community-based digital libraries, an enduring
challenge is negotiating the future with diverse community members, i.e.
establishing plans and strategies to guide future library technologies,
collections, and services. In this context, design and planning requires
organizations to take into account the day-to-day practices of individual
users, and the needs and desires of the larger community as the library
strives to reflect the values and long-term vision that the participants
have for their community or academic discipline as a whole. However, community
members do not necessarily share the same worldview with respect to values,
vision and library priorities, and careful attention must be paid to negotiating
diverse worldviews to arrive at a consensus for action (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Shumar03">Shumar
2003</a>).
<p>The purpose of this special issue is to consider the spectrum of approaches
being used by different libraries and service providers as they negotiate
the future with their user communities. At a time when a digital information
future is increasingly certain, this timely and much needed collection
of articles explores, documents and reflects on the theories, practices,
and experiments focusing on digital library users.
<p>More information than ever before is born-digital, i.e. most information
produced today has no print equivalent. Moreover, the news about users
and their consumption of information in this digital future is troubling.
Statistics for the past eight years show that even while the information
supply is growing, the amount consumed is barely changing, and is in fact
becoming a smaller fraction of what is produced (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Lyman-Varian03">Lyman
and Varian 2003</a>). "We're drowning in a sea of information" according
to Varian. "When you look at the challenge we face, how do we manage all
this information? Ability to capture all that information has outrun our
ability to utilize it effectively." Digital library research, HCI or information
design research and individual digital library projects will all benefit
from the broader theme that this special issue highlights: the building
of digital libraries in cooperation with how users are affected and how
their use of information can be improved and transformed by the increasing
information supply that the digital library or repository makes possible.
<h2>
Three approaches to negotiating the future</h2>
Each paper in this special issue illustrates a particular approach to understanding
user needs, bringing organizational capabilities to bear on these needs,
and engaging a broad spectrum of community members in design and
governance. These approaches fall into three broad categories:
<ul>
<li>
user-centered design</li>

<li>
participatory design</li>

<li>
shared governance models</li>
</ul>
Each of these are discussed below in further detail.
<h3>
User-centered design</h3>
The central tenets of user-centered design, originating from human factors,
are the early and continual involvement of users in the design process,
a focus on real users and their tasks, and iterative design guided by frequent
formative evaluations (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Meister85">Meister 1985</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Booth89">Booth
1989</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Gouldetal91">Gould <i>et al</i>. 1991</a>). Numerous
user-centered design methodologies based on these tenets have been proposed,
including task-centered design (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Lewis-Rieman93">Lewis and Rieman
1993</a>), goal-based design (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Cooper99">Cooper 1999</a>), and
scenario-based design (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Rosson-Carroll02">Rosson and Carroll 2002</a>).
All of these methodologies draw on suites of common design practices and
formative evaluation techniques, e.g. interviews, observations, prototyping,
usability inspections, and usability studies. Many efforts have investigated
how standard design and evaluation techniques can be modified to better
serve the specific needs of digital libraries and other information technologies
such as hypertext/hypermedia for education (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Blandfordetal04">Blandford
<i>et
al</i>. 2004</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Budhu-Coleman02">Budhu and Coleman 2002</a>,
<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#McKnightetal96">McKnight
<i>et
al</i>. 1996</a>).
<p>Irrespective of the particular methodology chosen, the objectives of
a user-centered design process are to develop a deep understanding of user
requirements for technology design and planning, and to get systematic
user feedback on evolving library systems throughout the design process.
It is the responsibility of library designers to generate possible design
options and to devise appropriate protocols and studies to elicit user
feedback on these options.
<p>In this issue <a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/Shreeves/">Shreeves and Kirkham</a> describe
an early pilot study to test the viability of a search portal created specifically
for discovering primary source materials by K-12 teachers-in-training and
for use in a classroom. They tested their portal early with users and are
candid and blunt in their assessment of the challenges that aggregation
of heterogeneous metadata, despite being OAI-compliant, poses to users
and service providers. Focus groups, written evaluation, and transaction
logs were used to gather data and understand actual usage and user needs.
They found that multiple levels of intervention are necessary if aggregation
of metadata is to lead to successful user experiences. These findings,
because they were early in the development of the portal, helped them redesign
it to offer a more successful user experience to a specific community.
<h3>
Participatory design</h3>
Participatory design methods seek to involve users more deeply in the process
as co-designers, i.e. users also propose and generate design alternatives
as opposed to simply providing feedback on designer-generated options (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Greenbaum-Kyung91">Greenbaum
and Kyung 1991</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Schuler-Namioka93">Schuler and Namioka 1993</a>).
An important ideal of participatory design is industrial democracy (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Ehn89">Ehn
1989</a>), which implies that users should be politically empowered with
a broad design remit that includes: co-designing the technology, co-determining
the nature of the design process itself (schedules, processes, outcomes),
and co-designing the social conditions of technology use (i.e. work practices,
organizational structures and responsibilities). Contextual inquiry, where
the designer works/interacts with the user in the work environment, is
a particular technique and is intended to support the development of products
that support, extend and transform user work (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Wixonetal90">Wixon <i>et al</i>. 1990</a>).
<p>Participatory design requires significant and ongoing collaboration
between designers and users throughout the design process. A key challenge
to any participatory design process is access to users: it is difficult
organizationally, logistically, and financially to bring users and developers
together to engage in collaborative design on a frequent and sustained
basis. As such, participatory design has historically been most successful
in in-house software development contexts where users and developers are
part of the same organization and are often co-located (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Grudin91">Grudin
1991</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Grudin93">Grudin 1993</a>).
<p>In this issue <a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/Bartolo/">Bartolo <i>et al</i></a>. describe
the work being done to integrate material from scientists/researchers'
workspaces within a digital library (MatDL). Their project is an alliance
of many geographically distributed institutions, and they are adapting
open source tools such as CVS to enable collaboration on tasks. At the
same time as tools are modified and developed, use and users of the library
are supported using techniques such as kernel groups and student feedback
from courses. A kernel group is an interesting form of participatory design
as it encompasses notions of collaboration (access to designers and users
among different partners), interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity
(partners come from many disciplines) and practice and use environments
(partners and users include teachers, students, researchers, etc.).
<p>Unsurprisingly, many have seized on the Internet and Web as offering
the technical means to enable wider user participation in the design process
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Divitinietal99">Divitini <i>et al</i>. 1999</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Hepsoetal99">Hepso
<i>et
al</i>. 1999</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Weatherleyetal02">Weatherley <i>et al</i>.
2002</a>). Collaboration systems based on these ubiquitous technical infrastructures
could, in theory, provide a virtual commons where distributed stakeholders
overcome cultural and geographic separation to get together and engage
in collaborative design on a regular basis, without having to travel to
distant locations and without taking large chunks of time away from their
other work responsibilities. Needless to say, given the inherently distributed
nature of digital library users, approaches that enable such users to participate
meaningfully in the design and planning of library systems would be invaluable.
Despite the promise, results to date have been mixed, with some groups
reporting reasonable success (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Farschchian-Divitini99">Farschchian
and Divitini 1999</a>, <a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Weatherleyetal02">Weatherley <i>et al</i>.
2002</a>) and others reporting little participation by users (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Hepsoetal99">Hepso
<i>et
al</i>. 1999</a>).
<p><a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/Khoo/">Khoo</a>'s contribution to this issue provides valuable
insight into the formidable barrier posed by the variable understanding
of developers and users about the same artifact they are building together.
A study in organizational communication, individual participant understandings
about the word 'resource' are described in detail in order to highlight
the different tacit understandings that existed among participants of the
same digital library project. The human-based effort to create concept
maps that represented the collection development process also resulted
in the creation of an online communication tool, the DWEL WorkHub, to represent
the knowledge of the developers to the users and increase understanding
between both groups.
<p>While participatory design embraces the importance of co-designing the
social conditions of technology use, the ideals of industrial democracy
often get lost when applied to North American contexts (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Schuler-Namioka93">Schuler
and Namioka 1993</a>). Participatory design projects tend to focus on technology
innovations as opposed to emphasizing social change (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Bishopetal03">Bishop
<i>et
al</i>. 2003</a>). Participatory action research builds on the participatory
design tradition, but instead emphasizes working with community groups
to effect immediate social change and building capacity within these groups
to frame and investigate issues of their own concern. Thus, the design
and use of library technologies and services takes a back seat to helping
community groups affect local change. Participatory action research contexts
can often yield invaluable, possibly profound, insights in the design and
planning of library technologies and services as this approach requires
designers to focus on the transformational needs of specific community
groups.
<p><a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/Bishop/">Bishop <i>et al</i></a>., writing in this issue,
emphasize participatory action research with the goal of effecting change
through the use of Inquiry Labs (iLabs). This approach is about stimulating,
motivating, improving, integrating learning within a community, often a
marginalized group, by infusing library technologies and capabilities into
community organizations rather than bringing users to the library. They
describe the iLabs suite as "simultaneously a Web site, a community of
learners, and a locus for knowledge construction". A simple blend of informational
and communication tools is offered for diverse sets of users: users of
iLabs inquiry activities come from all walks of life such as neighborhood
activism, university courses, research projects, committee work, K-12 education,
conference presentations, developing international professional associations,
and art projects. iLabs reflect the successful fulfillment of user needs
that have surfaced in many different arenas over and over again, and are
helping in the transformation of people's ability to process and use information
on both sides of the digital divide.
<p>This is especially relevant in view of a report about the digital divide
that claims the Internet has no social impact on low-income adults but
may increase learning motivation and cognitive competencies (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Jacksonetal04">Jackson
<i>et
al</i>. 2004</a>). Low income African Americans and Caucasians included
in the study, when using the Internet for the first time used it as an
informational tool, not as a communication tool. Email, the most popular
application was useless to them because they had no friends or co-workers
to whom they could send email.
<h3>
Shared governance models</h3>
The third model for negotiating the future has its roots not in design
research but in educational administration and, more broadly, organizational
development (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Shafritz-Ott92">Shafritz and Ott 1992</a>). "The
process of consultation", wrote John J. Corson in 1941, "strengthens the
allegiance to the institution and their individual zeal and satisfaction"
(<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Douglass98">Douglass 1998</a>). In a nutshell, that is the essence
of the shared governance model: respect for the different roles played
by students, faculty, staff, administrators, and the general public, and
ensuring that all continue to feel a sense of ownership for the institution
through the process of consultation, with the benefit of greater excellence
and improvement for all. While shared governance is an idea that is generally
considered to have originated in academic governance, it has been found
to be effective as a business management strategy for services such as
IT security risk management, and is promoted as a tool for global and sustainable
management of our environment (<a href="index.html%3Fprintable=1.1.html#Sachs04">Sachs 2004</a>). Shared
governance is also practised by another venerable academic endeavor: the
publishing of scholarly journals. Consider the peer review process: most
scholarly refereeing is unpaid labor that the individual offers as a service
to the discipline and as part of her responsibility and commitment to help
maintain the quality of the work published in the discipline.
<p>Two articles in this special issue use shared governance quite innovatively
and in different ways from each other to inform the design of the digital
library, deliver needed services to users, and ensure sustainability. In
the process they are also effecting social and educational changes. <a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/Foulke/">Foulke
<i>et
al</i></a>. describe the creation of Connecticut History Online (CHO),
a new non-profit entity to support cross-institution collaboration, incorporating
different advisory groups, including one for teachers and one for educator
specialists, into a formal governance structure. Partnership is a core
value, while ownership and consensus building are integral to all the project's
efforts. CHO holds promise for changing the digital futures of libraries,
archives, museums, and educational institutions from objects on separate
trajectories to partners in a more seamlessly integrated world of multimedia
information.
<p><a href="http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v05/i03/McMartin/">McMartin</a> emphasizes how shared governance
is an inherent part of MERLOT's business model, perhaps even a direct influence
on its sustainability. Again, partnership is emphasized: in sharing the
governance of the MERLOT collection among a large and distributed group,
the responsibility for the integrity and quality of the collection is distributed
among the faculty, similar to the scholarly journal's editorial and peer
review model. Besides encouraging digital library research projects and
initiatives to incorporate shared governance models for long-term success
and sustainability, MERLOT could influence changes in social processes
such as academic peer review and the promotion and tenure process.
<h2>
Conclusions</h2>
The users of digital libraries like MERLOT number in the tens of thousands.
Others are much smaller, but no matter the size, digital libraries almost
always involve distributed, semi-virtual communities of users. In these
communities, traditional users - scientists, researchers, educators, lifelong
learners, and the general public - work alongside stakeholders (funding
organizations, policy makers, publishers), together with software developers,
librarians, archivists, records managers, and museum curators. The collaborative
work of these groups ranges widely: they create and share data/content,
conduct scientific research, develop metadata schemas, create metadata
for objects, develop policies, software, and protocols for services and
management. The articles in this issue describe some major experiments
with integrated and sustainable building of digital libraries in ways that
meet user needs.
<p>We have come a long way from early digital library development efforts
where the predominant model was often system-oriented or followed structured
development design. Approaches such as the waterfall model, where users
had a specific place in the design process, are no longer the only option
for building digital libraries. Almost all the efforts reported here mix
and match approaches. Users are involved and integral to the entire lifecycle
of the digital library: design, use and sustainability. In the participatory
design iLabs, one important community using the Inquiry Page is the Water
CAMPWS collaboratory which links researchers, teachers, students, government
agencies, industry and general public on the topic of water purification.
Water purification is often a local government policy question that needs
input from a shared governance model for effective resolution or management.
Similarly, in MERLOT educators have clear ideas about information quality.
These differ by discipline, and furthermore must be contextualized with
use information (when was the resource used, by whom, etc.). Thus, hybrid
approaches integrating users in design and development - whether using
a design approach like user-centered design, participatory design, or an
organizational development approach such as shared governance - appear
to offer more promise for successful digital information use, enhancing
such use beyond mere information access to transforming users, and ensuring
library sustainability.
