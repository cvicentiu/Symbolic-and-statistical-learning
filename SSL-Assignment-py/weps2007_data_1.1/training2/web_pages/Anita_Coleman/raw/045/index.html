It examines suggestions for integration and interdisciplinarity in education for digital libraries curricula using definitions of a discipline, interdisciplinarity, and the transdisciplinary structure of a university in order to discover how such integration may be successfully accomplished. A plan to use learning communities and develop an interdisciplinary curriculum for Knowledge Organization is briefly discussed.<BR></P>

This article, written from a supervisor's perspective, outlines some of those specific attributes that we look for when recruiting and explains their importance in today's cataloging environment.</P>

"Practitioner Perspectives on Cataloging Education for Entry-Level Academic Librarians." <U>Library Resources &amp; Technical Services</U> 46, no. 1 (2001): 11-22.<BR>Abstract: The role of cataloging education within the library profession is a topic of considerable interest and debate. Fifty-five heads of reference and sixty-five heas of cataloging in Association of Research Librarians institutions responded to a survey based upon the Association of Library Collections and Technical Services Educational Policy Statement, Appendix: Knowledge and Skills, Intellectual Access and Informaiton Organization, concerning the importance of cataloging competencies for all entry-level academic librarians. The survey found that practitioners agreed upon a definite set of core cataloging competencies that all entry-level academic librarians should possess. This finding holds larger implications for library education for academic librarians and for the profession as a whole.</P>
<P>15. MacLeod, Judy and Callahan Daren. "Educators and Practitioners Reply: An Assessment of Cataloging Education." <U>Library Resources &amp; Technical Services</U> 39, no. 2 (1994): 153-65.<BR>Abstract: A recent study of entry-level catalogers indicated that they did not feel sufficiently prepared for their first professional positions by the courses they took in library school. This paper reporst the results of a survey of both cataloging educators andn practitioners. The survey was designed to gather the opinions of these professionals about cataloging course content, the chief objectives of cataloging education, cataloging practicums, what constitutes preparation for professional cataloging, theory vs. practice, on-the-job training, and the extent of communication between cataloging educators and practitioners. While recent discussions of the status of cataloging education have indicated that course content is becoming more generalized, the results of this study support the value of expanded graduate programs and advanced courses and practicums that utilize practitioners for instruction. The combination of narrative responses and quantitative data from the two groups provides an intriguing comparison of their assessment of contemporary cataloging educational objectives and goals.</P>

The trends and needs of Catalogilng and Classification professionals were analyzed from professional literature and compare with course descriptions. The author identifies the variety of ways that cataloging content is covered in education programs particularly the titles of courses containing cataloging content and also calls for curriculum experts to be aware of the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the profession.</P>

"Knowledge Bases and Library Education." <U>College &amp; Research Libraries</U> 47, no. 1 (January 1986): 16-27.<BR>Abstract: A continuing topic of debate among library administrators and library educators is whether graduate library education adequately prepares librarians for the research library environment. Unfortunately, there has been little research to identify specific knowledge needs of academic research librarians or how these needs change over the librarians's career. There also has been insufficient attention paid to what training libarary administrators must provide to supplement the graduate programs as the librarian moves through a career that will span many years and countless changes. Therefore, randomly sampled ARL librarians were asked to rate fifty-six knowledge bases according to how important they were and the degree to which they possessed each knowledge.</P>
<P>19. Riemer, John J. "A Practitioner's View of the Education of Catalogers." <U>Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly</U> 16, no. 3 (1993): 39-48.<BR>Abstract: Future production of qualified first-time catalogers depends on the amount of cooperation between educator/practitioner. Collectively, both educator and practitioner must find common ground in education and preparation for the library student to be fully competent as a cataloger. The proposition of implementing laboratories, curriculum improvement for catalogers, and creation of internships gives the library student a mixture of theory and application, assuring proficiency as a first-time cataloger.</P>

<P>21. Ryans, Cynthia C. "Cataloging Administrators' Views on Cataloging Education." <U>Library Resources &amp; Technical Services</U> 24, no. 4 (1978): 343-51.<BR>Abstract: One of the basic questions in structuring a cataloging and classification course in a graduate library school program is the importance of teaching course in the theoretical versus the practical mode or a combination of the two. This article reports the results of a survey of cataloging practitioners on their opinions on the following issues: (1)structure of the cataloging curriculum in today's graduate library school; (2) relationship of the use of computers in cataloging to the cataloging curriculum; and (3) adequacy of preparation of current graduates for positions as catalog librarians.</P>
<P>22. Speller Jr, Benjamin F. "Putting Theory into Practice: An Overview of the Symposium." <U>Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly</U> 16, no. 3 (1993): 1-6.<BR>Abstract: Together library schools and libraries can prepare entry level professional librarians for a smooth transition to the practical world of librarianship in technical services. The teaching of practice versus theory in librarianship remains an issue: this article is a commentary on how library schools are dealing with the problem.</P>

"Comparison of Required Introductory Cataloging Courses, 1986 to 1998." <U>Library Resources &amp; Technical Services</U> 43, no. 4 (1999): 223-30.<BR>Abstract: Cataloging is an important part of library education. Concerns about the declining number of required introductory cataloging courses led to this study in which data collected from library school bulletins were compared to data gathered in a similar 1986 study. Results indicate that the number of required introductory cataloging courses has dropped.</P>

"Cataloging Across the Curriculum: A Syndetic Structure for Teaching Cataloging." <U>Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly</U> 24, no. 1/2 (1997): 35-59.<BR>Abstract: Continuous consideration of the curriculum and the environment is required to provide a cataloging curriculum responsive to an evolving profession yet grounded in solid theory and principles. The necessary competencies for future catalogers suggested by the cataloging community are examined. Fifty-two ALA-accredited library school programs are analyzed to determine the strength of cataloging within the curriculum and the degree to which the competencies are addressed. It is concluded that adequate education of future catalogers requires an expanded view beyond traditional cataloging courses. The recommendation is for a curricular syndetic structure that identifies relationships among courses and links courses with the concepts and competencies necessary for organizing information.</P>
