<p>Advances in Internet technologies have made it seemingly possible and
easy to create digital collections, repositories and libraries. However,
supporting diverse information uses that facilitate interaction beyond
searching and browsing is in the early stages. Interactive digital libraries,
or interactional digital libraries as we prefer to call them, are still
evolving. This special issue tries to bring together work that is being
done to incorporate interactivity in digital libraries.
<p>The issue evolved in cooperation with some of the successful recipients
of the 2002 National Science Digital Library (NSDL) program solicitation
sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In fall 2001, a few
months after the NSDL awards were announced, we browsed through the list
of currently active awards and read 64 abstracts. We selected 13 NSF-NSDL
projects that highlighted interactivity as a key feature of their research
and development efforts. We sent the principal investigators an invitation
to write for this special issue and also posted a public <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/calls/interactdl.html">call
for papers</a>. Experts from Europe and the US, with academic and practice
affiliations, many of whom refereed two papers apiece, provided invaluable
feedback. After peer review and revisions we are pleased to share nine
of these papers (six NSDL-related and three others).
<p>The NSDL program "aims to establish a national digital library that
will constitute an online network of learning environments and resources
for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education
at all levels" (<a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/">NSF-NSDL
2002</a>). <a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl/reports.asp">Reports
and background material</a> on the NSF-NSDL program are available from
the NSF Web site.
<p>As noted, not all papers in this issue are from the NSDL initiative.
Nevertheless, the common subthemes for all papers are the technologies,
information uses and theories driving content development
for interactional digital libraries. The NSDL papers have an additional
component in that they address the process of interactivity in the context
of formal undergraduate learning. They make clear that interactivity is
more than just a point and click approach to learning. Interactivty can
stimulate, through reciprocal action, feedback, immersion, play, flow and
other designed attributes, user acquisition of abstract concepts and skills
besides discipline-based, content learnng outcomes. Further, the reports
of interfaces, services, tools and collections provide a view of information
use behaviors in disciplines such as astronomy, earth sciences and mathematics.
Some of the focus is on actual information use: what do the technologies
enable the user to do with documents once they've found the information?
<p>We hope that bringing these papers together in a special issue is useful.
Additionally, we would like to issue a challenge to <i>JoDI</i> readers,
authors and researchers in the realm of interactional digital libraries.
<h2>
The Challenge</h2>
Interactional digital libraries can and should draw from research in several
areas such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Retrieval,
Educational Technology, and Instructional Design. In tracing the history
of HCI development, Dillon (2002, p. 463) notes that “HCI has always sought
to be more than just about user interface design but about interaction”.
He outlines three stages of HCI development. In the first stage, the focus
was on interface design with a strong methodological tradition that believed
in user testing as the best means of improving user-interface design (Shackel
1959, Schneiderman 1980). In the second stage, attempts were made to model
interaction. Modeling interaction was grounded in a theoretical tradition
that tried to develop an all-embracing theory of interaction (generalized
laws and principles of interaction) based on specific interactive phenomena.
Interactive phenomena such as differences in reading speed for digital
and paper media (Gould <i>et al</i>. 1987), expert performance speeds for
routine cognitive tasks (Card <i>et al</i>. 1983), and user performance
in menu-based navigation tasks (Norman 1992) were studied. The theories
developed, however, still do not have sufficient predictive power about
user issues that are important to usable systems design. On the positive
side, user testing is no longer the only way to design usable systems.
The third stage in HCI, still unattained, is to support the design of more
humanly acceptable information technologies that will enhance and augment
human capabilities in all spheres.
<p>The problematic situation facing digital library design and use can
be stated as a set of basic research questions: What is an interactional
digital library? How will people use interactional digital libraries? How
can interactional digital libraries enhance and augment human capabilities?
These questions can also be reframed as three challenges for further digital
library development:
<p><b>1. Information Spaces.</b> McKnight (2000, p. 730) uses information
space to mean "objects (real or virtual) to which the individual turns
to acquire information”. Information spaces will increasingly be made up
of heterogeneous formats. Dillon (2002) calls this the multimedia mix-and-match.
The challenge is the “smooth blending of multimedia” in interfaces (ibid.,
p. 469). How can information displays in digital libraries enable users
to extract meanings by mixing multimedia (sound, graphics, video, text,
all seamlessly linked) for an interactive experience? Furthermore, new
technologies will result in “wholly new forms”, possibly new genres of
information that will only exist digitally; genres may also be consciously
designed. In fact Winograd (1996) argues for this. Tools are needed to
support the transformation and derivations of new genres from underlying
information units by readers of documents and the users of digital libaries.
The first challenge is to build information spaces that are heterogeneous
and include support tools for shaping them.
<p><b>2. Learning Spaces.</b> Coleman <i>et al</i>. (2001) define learning
spaces in digital libraries as information spaces that are based on knowledge
organization and instructional design principles. Learning spaces display
the best information for learning in an optimal manner; they incorporate
intelligent, interactive information retrieval, customized for or controlled
by users' learning styles. They use instructional technology, which is
concerned with information layout and sequencing for user understanding
and improvement of learning. They offer the promise of improving the learning
of difficult, abstract concepts and skills such as scientific reasoning
by incorporating the notion of information work (Sundaram 1996a, 1996b).
Taxonomies of tasks and user behaviors in the context of disciplinary and
general learning are developed; scientific classifications and general
knowledge representation schemes are merged with tasks and learning outcomes
to develop ontologies and information-use maps. The second challenge is
to build learning spaces that go beyond the ability to retrieve information,
and include the facility to customize and filter information, to get only
relevant documents, to adjust sequencing and presentation of information
according to learning theories, information-seeking and disciplinary use
behaviors. Thus, knowledge representation techniques that facilitate information
use for learning tasks, information visualizations that transcend human
processing limitations, and user evaluation that is woven into design,
play key roles in building learning spaces.
<p><b>3. Interaction Spaces.</b> Winograd (2002, p. 260) questions the
current model of interaction architecture and device communication - based
on the standard figure of a user in front of a screen with a keyboard/pointing
device - and argues for the need to evolve towards a different architecture
of multiple users in interactive spaces. Dillon (2002) refers to this as
'Ubiquity' or ‘We Want Information Where We Are'. Ubiquitous computers
may help reduce the problem of information overload (Weiser 2001). Information
access is a question of whether users get information from a device, whether
old devices may be modified to provide new functions, or whether we meet
the real challenge of freeing human users from the multiplicity of physically
located devices for information access. Therefore, the third challenge
is to build such interaction spaces for digital libraries that both free
the user from physical limitations as well as provide the benefits of virtual
interactions (for example, asynchronous interactivity) and communities
to digital libraries.
<p>The information-learning-interaction spaces challenge provides a framework
and directs digital library research and development to the human rather
than just the technical problems. It is also grounded in the realization
that libraries, whether they are digital or traditional, are socially constructed,
and that the values of a society are embodied in the use of a library.
Are these challenges realistic? Are such interactional digital libraries
possible? Can they be built for successful use? We invite the community
to discuss and explore. The papers in this issue show how current projects
and initiatives are handling some of the challenges.
<p>Hoban <i>et al</i>. in <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Hoban/">Virtual Telescopes
in Education</a>, present the philosophical and resulting technical approaches
to the role of interactivity in digital libraries. They use interactivity
to enable the participation of novices in the scientific process just as
expert astronomers do on a daily basis. Designing a customizable virtual
observatory is only one element in engaging learners in this process-driven
environment. To encourage them to participate in the scientific inquiry
process, learners are guided through developing a research proposal, gathering
and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and developing a report on their
findings.
<p>In <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Domenico/">Thematic Real-time Environmental
Distributed Data Services (THREDDS)</a>, Domenico
<i>et al</i>. discuss
the characteristics of earth systems data and illustrate specialized visualization
and analysis tools being developed to allow the user to manipulate and
interact with earth systems data. A related paper,
<a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Klaus/">Atmospheric Visualization Collection: Developments
in the NSDL</a> by Klaus <i>et al</i>.,
highlights the differences between public users and researchers in using
their visualization database of atmospheric data. It illustrates how incorporating
interactive assessment and development activities into the learning environments
encourages participation and establishes an interactive user-provider community.
<p>Clark <i>et al</i>. in <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Clark/">Digital
Archive Network for Anthropology</a> highlight the opportunity for
interactive digital collections in anthropology and discuss work being
done to create an interactive virtual laboratory experience for people from all levels who have
interests in anthropology. Capabilities for creating both two- and three-dimensional
models of materials that can be manipulated, allowing the user to take
precise measurements, all enhance the experience and detailed study of
anthropological specimens. Further, they increase research accessibility
as some of these specimens were previously not available for open study.
<p><a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Lee/">Designing the User Interface for the
Fischlar Digital Video Library</a>, by Lee and Smeaton, presents the design
space concept and framework for designing a video browser. User interfaces
and query mechanisms of current video libraries are discussed, as well
as the design framework used in developing a keyframe-based video browser
for this video library project in Ireland.
<p>Yaron <i>et al</i>. detail the creation of interactive learning experiences
through the CreateStudio development environment. <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Yaron/">Linked
Active Content for Digital Libraries for Education</a> demonstrates a principle
that has long been recognized in systems development: the need to separate
content from software. In an information use context this allows for easier
repurposing of content to create new interactive learning experiences.
<p>The concept of interactivity through inquiry-based education is discussed
by Moore <i>et al</i>. <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Moore/">Active Netlib:
An Active Mathematical Software Collection for Inquiry-based Computational
Science and Engineering Education</a> discusses executable mathematical
software that both guides users in selecting appropriate software based
on the user’s needs, and assists users in setting correct parameters and
interpreting results.
<p>In <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Liu/">Federated Searching Interface Techniques
for Heterogeneous OAI Repositories</a>, Liu <i>et al</i>. highlight the
importance of developing a rich unified search interface built on the metadata
and controlled vocabularies used across heterogeneous digital library collections.
They discuss problems that arise in creating a unified search interface
in Arc, a fully implemented system providing access to content from 75
different data providers.
<p>Salampasis and Diamantaras, in <a href="http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v02/i04/Salampasis/">Experimental
User-centered Evaluation of an Open Hypermedia System and Web Information-Seeking
Environments</a>, discuss information seeking strategies and environments.
The use of a single search interface, such as the Web, for multiple search
strategies is examined and compared with an interaction model based on
multiple user interfaces and search strategies used in parallel.
<p>We hope you enjoy the special issue and look forward to your responses
to The Challenge of building interactional digital libraries.
