				Sr.</b><br>
				<br>
				MONAHANS — William Anderson Garrard Sr., “Bill,” 83, of Wickett, 
				passed away Tuesday, May 18, 2004, at Medical Center Hospital 
				after a sudden illness. He was born November 1, 1920, to Ethel 
				Ora Jackson and John Mason Garrard in Crystal Falls, Texas.<br>
				He is survived by his wife, Joyce of the home; two sons, William 
				Anderson Garrard Jr. and wife, April, of Phoenix, Ariz.; Patrick 
				Alan Garrard and wife Deanna of Amarillo, Texas; one grandson 
				Justin Alan Garrard and wife, Tawny of Chandler, Arizona; and 
				three other “furry grandchildren,” Moxie, Suzie and Gracie of 
				Amarillo, Texas. He is also survived by one sister, Luvenia 
				Ellen Holt of Dallas and one brother, Thomas Jackson Garrard of 
				Euliss, Texas. He was preceded in death by his first wife, 
				Harriet Jane Ryerson “Hap” in 1996; his mother Ethel and father 
				John; Brother Glenn Edwin, Sisters Venita Catherine Lantron and 
				Arvilla Lorraine Pollard. He was married to Ruby Joyce Claburn 
				on November 3, 2000. His blended family includes three other 
				sons and one daughter; Chuck and wife Nancy Claburn of Midland, 
				Mike and wife Carla Claburn of Monahans; Mark and wife Sarah 
				Claburn of Dallas; Patti and husband Mike Stevenson of San 
				Antonio; twelve grandchildren, Chasity and husband Kevin Kemp, 
				Carrie and husband Steve Watson, Chad and wife Melissa Claburn, 
				Brent Stevenson, Lauren Stevenson, Rachel Stevenson, Bradley 
				Stevenson, Michael Claburn, Taryn Claburn, Jacob Claburn and 
				Kate Claburn; and four great-grandchildren, Bailey Kemp, Foster 
				Kemp, Austin Watson and Makaila Claburn.<br>
				Bill served in the Texas National Guard for 3 years in 
				Breckenridge, Texas, before being mobilized into the regular 
				Army in November 1940. He attained the rank of Staff Sergeant 
				and was awarded several medals, including the Unit Commendation 
				Medal with four battle stars, Bronze Star for Bravery, French 
				Croix de Guerre and the Purple Heart.<br>
				Bill worked for Gulf Oil Company for 37 years before retiring. 
				He served as a proud member of First United Methodist Church of 
				Wickett for over 50 years where he served in many positions, 
				including Church Representative to Conference, Lay Leader, 
				Sunday School Teacher, Chairman of the Board and Song Leader. It 
				was Bill’s early efforts and those of the other church members 
				that built the current church sanctuary literally with nothing, 
				in 1956-’57. He hosted regular Bible Study groups in the home, 
				radiating joy, compassion, tenderness and the love of God. He 
				was a true servant of God.<br>
				In addition to his dedicated church service, Bill was an elected 
				member of the Wickett City Council and volunteer for several 
				organizations. His activities included: Gleaners food deliverer 
				for 20 years, Meals-on-Wheels for disabled for 20 years, song 
				leader for Sing-A-Longs at the Senior Citizen Center and 
				bingo-caller at the Center for the past 10 years. Bill has been 
				among the “Stars at the Senior Citizen Revue” for 10 years, 
				which helped to raise money for Meals on Wheels. When the boys 
				were growing up he served as Assistant and Head Scoutmaster for 
				Boy Scouts of America, was an ardent member and fund-raiser for 
				the Quarterback Club and Band Boosters, 4-H Club Booster and 
				Little League Baseball Coach. He loved Lobo football, fishing, 
				hunting and all sports. He was most recently honored as the Star 
				Veteran of Ward County.<br>
				Bill was known to be a kind, fun-loving person, always had a 
				smile on his face and a story of inspiration to tell. He loved 
				to dance with his wife Joyce, had a special nickname for 
				everyone he met and excelled at “showing out.” As a result of 
				the hearing loss suffered from his military duty he often turned 
				his misunderstood words into hilarious and cute retorts to the 
				confusion and amusement of those who knew him best. Bill 
				faithfully attended and supported his Company “L” reunions from 
				their earliest days and enjoyed attending family reunions. He 
				will be greatly missed by all.<br>
				Funeral services will be Thursday, May 20, 2004, at 2 p.m. in 
				the First United Methodist Church of Monahans. Interment will 
				follow in the Monahans Memorial Cemetery.<br>
				There will be a viewing at Heritage Funeral Home. In lieu of 
				flowers, donations may be made to the Wickett United Methodist 
				Church Building Fund. <br>
