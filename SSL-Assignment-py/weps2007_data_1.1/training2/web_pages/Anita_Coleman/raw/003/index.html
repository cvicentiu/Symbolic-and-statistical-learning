		<td><p><br />Anita Sundaram Coleman is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information 
		Resources &amp; Library Science at the University of Arizona, Tucson, which she joined in 2001. 
		Before coming to Arizona, she was with the Alexandria Digital Library 
		<acronym title="Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype">ADEPT</acronym> Project, where she worked 
		with the development of a metadata standard for learning objects in Geography. She has worked 
		in special collections, technical, and public service areas in academic libraries. She currently 
		teaches courses in Knowledge Structures and Information Seeking Behaviors, and has taught 
		others such as Systems Analysis, Cataloging and Classification at the University of Illinois at 
		Urbana-Champaign and the University of California at Los Angeles.<br /><br />

		Coleman&#8217;s current research program examines both sides of the information coin, 
		representations of information and information uses and users, specifically those related to 
		learning at the undergraduate level, in an unified program of inquiry. The goal is to study 
		uses, users, and information organization and representation for a better understanding and 
		definition of 'interactional digital libraries.' Her funded research includes:</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>classification and cataloging of 'scientific models' as works where she is working with 
			extensions to the Dublin Core metadata borrowing the definition of complex objects from the a
			rchival community, utilizing analytical cataloging principles, and facet analysis to improve 
			the information retrieval of models;
			</li>
			
			<li>citation analysis of Geographic Information Science 
			(<acronym title="Geographica Information Science">GIS</acronym>) where she seeks to distinguish 
			information science from information technology concepts;
			</li>
			
			<li>citation analysis of academic, teaching products in 
			<acronym title="Geographica Information Science">GIS</acronym> and studying information 
			behaviors to understand use of interactive electronic resources in the sciences;
			</li>
			
			<li>use and user studies of engineering laboratories in an attempt to inform the design and 
			vocabulary  in a geo-technical, rock, and water resources digital library.
			</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>Coleman&#8217;s recent writings have appeared in <em>D-Lib Magazine, Cataloging and Classification 
		Quarterly</em>, Proceedings of the International Society for Knowledge Organization, and the British 
		<em>Journal of Digital Information</em> 
		(<acronym title="Journal of Digital Information">JoDI</acronym>). Interactional digital libraries 
		and the research issues underlying them are discussed in the 
		<acronym title="Journal of Digital Information">JoDI</acronym> special issue published May 2002.
		<br /><br />
 
		Coleman is the Editor for the Digital Libraries theme of 
		<acronym title="Journal of Digital Information">JoDI</acronym> and is on the Steering Committee of 
		the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education. In cooperation with the Arizona Health Sciences 
		Library at <acronym title="University of Arizona">UA</acronym>, she is involved in the development 
		of <acronym title="Digital Library of Information Science">DLIST</acronym>, the Digital Library of 
		Information Science and Technology, an 
		<acronym title="Open Applications Interface">OAI</acronym>-compliant Eprints based repository for 
		disciplinary materials in <acronym title="Library Information Science">LIS</acronym>
		&amp; <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>.<br /><br />
        
		Coleman has a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature. She received her Master&#8217;s degree 
		in Library &amp; Information Science from the Sarada Ranganathan Department of Library Science, 
		University of Madras, India. She also has a Master&#8217;s degree in Curriculum &amp; Instruction, with 
        specialization in Educational Technology from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. 
		Her <acronym title="Philosophiae Doctor">Ph.D.</acronym> in Library and Information Science is 
		from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her doctoral dissertation is titled, 
		<em>Towards the design of the Hypermedia Journal</em> and it discusses both information work 
        and the design of tools to support such work. </p>
