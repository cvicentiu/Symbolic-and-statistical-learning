<P>BENNINGTON township was organized in 18 15. It is situated on the northern borders of</P>

<P>Licking county, bounded on the east by Burlington township, on the west by Hartford, on the south by Liberty, and on the
north by Knox county.</P>

<P>The general face of the township is level or gently undulating, and it is well watered by North fork of Licking and its
tributaries. The North fork rises partly in the northwest corner of this township, and passing a short distance through the
northern part, enters Knox county about the center of the northern line of this township, re-entering the township again and
passing across the northeast corner. The largest stream in the township which, however, is not large-is the Otter fork, a
tributary of the North fork. It passes across the township from west to east, near its center,. pass ing across part of
Burlington township, and entering the North fork near the village of Homer. The Lake fork, another tributary of the North
fork, rises in the southern and western parts of this township, and running eastwardly, passes across the southern portion of
this and Burlington townships, entering the North fork in Washington township about half way between Utica and St.
Louisville. Upon a tributary of Lake fork, Indian run, is situated the village of Appleton. The tributaries of this stream water
all the southern part of the township. Many beautiful springs are located in this township, but it is not so prolific in that
respect as townships further east, notably Fallsburgh and Eden.</P>

<P>This is essentially a township of farmers, there being no railroad, telegraph, turnpike, or canal within its limits; and but one
small town.</P>

<P>When the first settlers entered the township, they found it heavily timbered with many varieties of hard wood, such as
usually grow on the uplands. The different families of oak were largely predominant, though beech, sugar, and other hard
woods were plenty. The undergrowth was hazel, paw-paw, hackberry, and, in minor proportions, spicewood, sassafras and
other varieties. The settlers in nearly every part of it found it necessary to clear away this timber in order to make room for
their cabins. This fine timber has been largely cleared away, and beautiful, well-fenced farms occupy its place.- The soil is
fertile, well tilled and as productive as any in the county.</P>

<P>Bennington presents few traces of the Mound Builders, and those not remarkable. The Indians seem to have left few traces
or reminiscences of their occupation. Few, or perhaps, no people now living in the township remember seeing them, and
they probably had no permanent camp within its limits, at least in historic times. A very small camp, not however
permanent, once had an existence on Indian run, near its junction with the Lake fork. It disappeared shortly after the first
settlement, but probably gave name to that stream. The first. white settler in the township was</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>398 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Henry Iles, who settled there in the spring of 1809. He was from Rockingham county, Virginia. John Dripps and Isaac
Vanausdel followed him in 1810, locating near the North fork. John Trout, in the same or next year, located on Otter fork,
where also Peter Staymates settled soon after. Settlers continued to come in year after year, generally from Pennsylvania
and Virginia, until the principal part of the territory of the township was settled. It was divided into ordinary sized farms,
and nearly all the township occupied, by 1835.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The "Cook settlement" was established in the vicinity of the present village of Appleton, sometime after the close of the
war of 1812, by Titus Knox and Captain Cook, and served as a nucleus for immigrants to the southern portion of the
township. The Van Fossens, Jesse Smith, Jacob Clem, the Wrights, Sangers, Carvers, McClintocks, Fishburns, and Trouts
were among the names of those familiarly known as early settlers.</P>

<P>In August, 1832, Titus Knox and Carey Mead laid out the village of Appleton, and named it in honor of Appleton Downer,
a lawyer of Zanesville, who had been a large land owner in the township. It is handsomely situated in a beautiful country,
near the southern borders of the township, but it never attained to the proportions of a town of one hundred inhabitants, and
has been on the decline in later years.</P>

<P>Carey Meade built the first house in Appleton, and there is something of a romantic history connected with it. Mr. Meade
had a pretty daughter who married a man named Delong, from the east, and Mr. Meade erected this house for a storeroom,
with the expectation that his son-in-law would bring on a stock of goods and become the first merchant of the future city.
For reasons very well understood this expectation was not realized, and thus the storeroom-a frame structure, one and a half
stories in height-stood empty for a time, and was the only building on the town plat when Mr. Gideon Long and family
came to the place, April 3, 1833. Mr. Long moved into this empty store room and occupied it some years. While he was yet
living in it Mr. David Messenger, yet living, a resident of Utica, and now a very aged man, came to Appleton, or the site of
it, Tented the front part of this building, and opened the first store in the place. Mr. Long, in order to encourage enterprise
and assist in building up the town squeezed his family into the single back room of this storehouse. He had, since his
advent in the place, been using the upper room of this building for a cabinet shop. A pair of stairs went up on the outside of
the building, and here he made tables, coffins, and other necessaries of life and death; and for himself a precarious living.
Mr. Messenger must have expected to transact a large business, as he brought on a large stock of goods, for those days, and
two clerks. Had the wolves and bears been his customers he would, no doubt, have done a large business, but as the
purchasing settlers were few and far between, the two clerks seemed superfluous.</P>

<P>These two clerks took boarding and lodging in the family of Mr. Long in that single back room of the store building. One of
these clerks was Mr. Franklin Bryant, who, after clerking some tine for Mr. Messenger, bought the store himself and
conducted it several years. He built the second frame house in town, which is yet standing, and is occupied as a dwelling by
Dr. Austin. Not being able to fill up that little back room entirely, with his family and two clerks, Mr. Long took in another
entire family-Mr. William Van Fossen, wife and one child. Mr. Van Fossen had made up his mind to settle here, and to
accommodate him while his cabin was in course of construction Mr. Long admitted' the family as boarders.</P>

<P>The other young gentleman clerk, who was a boarder in this large family with limited quarters, was usually called "Billy,"
and as he had very little clerking to do, spent most of the time in the woods hunting. Mrs. Long says "he was a good boy-a
jolly, whole-souled fellow as ever lived." His last name was Rosecranz, and he afterward became Major General William S.
Rosecranz, the hero of Stone River, and the gallant but unfortunate . commander of the Union forces at the great and
bloody battle of Chickamauga. "Billy" Rosecranz remained here as a clerk six months, and many times declared his
intention of becoming a soldier, and was sent to West Point soon after leaving this place. His father was at that time a
resident of Homer, in the adjoining township, and a merchant and farmer.</P>

</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 399</STRONG></P>

<P>This old store room is yet standing, and is part of the present store building of Mr. B. G. Hoover.</P>

<P>The Van Fossen cabin was probably the second or third cabin in the town.</P>

<P>The first school-house in this neighborhood, a log building, was erected some years before Appleton was laid out, and was
located where Mr. Bigler now lives. Joseph Kerr taught school here fifty-five years ago, and was probably the first teacher
in this part of the township. The second schoolhouse was a frame building and stood above Mr. Barrick's house on Harry
Ashley's farm. The third and present house-a good frame building was erected about 1870. All the children of school age in
town attend school here; they number fifty or sixty.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The first blacksmith shop in Appleton was erected by Mr. Snyder, who soon moved away, and Mr. John Copper occupied
the shop and became the permanent blacksmith. The old store building has always been occupied for that purpose, having
changed hands many times, and been added to. In addition to Mr. Hoover's store, Mr. W. T. Moorehead keeps a small stock
of goods at present, and Franklin Myers a small grocery. Besides this mercantile business, there are two wagon shops, two
blacksmith shops, two shoe shops, two hotels, and Gideon Long (Mr. Long and wife are both yet living) still carries on
cabinet making. The village is a pleasant one, the society good, the people being much interested in both religious and
secular education.</P>

<P>The village of Lock is located on the northern line of this township;-but the--larger part of it is in Knox county, the post
office and store being in that county. It is probable that Gideon Long was the first post master in Appleton and retained the
office many years; it is now kept by Thomas Morehead.</P>

<P>The first water-mill in this township-or mill of any kind-was erected by Jesse VanFossen, about a half mile above
Appleton, on Indian run. It was a saw-mill only. John Denty, yet living a mile above Appleton, erected the second mill, at
the junction of Indian run and Lake fork. This mill was both a grist and saw-mill in an early day, though at present only a
saw-mill, driven by steam power. It is the only mill now in the township., In the old log school-house, before mentioned as
standing on the place where Mr. Bigler now lives, was organized in 1828, what was probably, the first religious society in
the township. They call themselves Christians, but are generally better known as New Lights. </P>

<P>The well known pioneer preacher, Rev. Isaac N. Walters, was instrumental in establishing this church, and was assisted in
the organization by. Rev. Daniel Long and Rev Matthew Gardner. A number of the old settlers accepted the new doctrine,
among whom were Jesse VanFossen and wife, Catharine; John Helphrey; Jesse Lake and wife, Elizabeth; Daniel Helphrey
and wife, Mr. McNett and wife, and others. The old schoolhouse answered the purposes of this society several years; but in
1834, their numbers having increased somewhat by new additions to the "Cook settlement," they were enabled to erect a
frame church building; this was dedicated August 16, 1835, Rev. I. N. Walters preaching the dedicatory sermon. This
church building is yet standing, and is used by the organization of Grangers as a place of meeting. .</P>

<P>The second and present church was erected in 1875, being dedicated February 11, 1876; the sermon on this occasion being
preached by Elder Enos Peters, the present pastor.</P>

<P>The present condition of this church is a healthy one, the membership being about seventy-five. The Sunday-school was
organized about 1840, and has been kept up since during the summer months of each year. Its present membership is
probably fifty or more.</P>

<P>The Methodists early organized a society in the township, though no regular class was formed, so far as can be ascertained,
prior to 1840. Methodist preachers were among the first religious teachers to enter the township, preaching in the cabins of
the settlers and in the school-houses. In January, 1840, a class was organized by Rev. Wesley Clark, at the house of John
Denty, who is still a resident of the township. The members of this class were George Iles, John Denty, David Weyant, A.
C. Barber, Frederick Iles, Jonathan Clayton, Noah Southard, Edward Conner, and some others. The above</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>400 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>members were appointed a committee to purchase land and erect a church building.</P>

<P>The site for this building was selected near the center of the township, on the Hartford and Homer road, and near the Otter
Fork of Licking. The road from Appleton to Lock also crosses the above road at this church.</P>

<P>The first building erected, known as "Bennington Chapel," was a small, though substantial frame, and, as the work was
largely voluntary, and the material, in part, contributed, it only cost about three hundred dollars. During the last year (1880)
this building has been enlarged, repaired and finished in good style. Mr. George Iles died a few years ago, leaving a sum of
money, the interest of which was to be used in keeping up the church building, and in beautifying the cemetery grounds
adjoining.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>No regular preaching is now held in this church. A Sunday-school had an existence here at one time, but it is no longer kept
up. Both members of the church and pupils in the school, have generally transferred their allegiance to other churches,
mostly, perhaps, to the other Methodist churches, of which there are two in the township.</P>

<P>These two churches were organized and the buildings erected about the same time-in the year 1850. One of these,
"Lambert's Chapel," is located in the eastern part of the township, a little north of Lake fork, on the farm of Calvin Stout.</P>

<P>Among the originators of this organization were Jacob Lambert, Elias Kettle, John Denty and wife, William and Elizabeth
Denty, Josiah Shipley and wife, Richard Wells and some others. Prior to the erection of the church, meetings were
generally held at the house of Jacob Lambert. The present membership is forty or fifty, and a large and active
Sunday-school is kept up. The third Methodist Episcopal church in the township is located in Appleton.</P>

<P>Rev. Lemuel Yarnell was influential in this organization, and the first members were Louis Evans, Aaron Shaffer, John
Denty, A. C. Barber, Nathan Bigley, David Miller, Martin Light, Richard Wells, and some others. These gentlemen were
chosen as a committee to select a site and erect a church building. Rev. Yarnell carried around a subscription paper and
obtained money enough to erect a small frame building on the site of the present church. It was erected and dedicated in
1851. Rev. G. G. West, the pastor in charge, preaching the dedicatory sermon. After several years the old building
becoming too small to accommodate the people who gathered there, it was taken away and the present frame building
erected. The membership of this church is at present about forty.</P>

<P>The organization of the Sabbath-school is probably coeval with that of the church, and has been kept up in the summer time
since; the membership being now about forty or fifty.</P>

<P>Just prior to the late war a church was organized in the northeastern part of the township, mainly through the influence and
personal exertions of the Halls-Gideon Hall and his son John. A small number of Christians were living in this
neighborhood, and felt themselves able to sustain a church. Among the members of the first organization were Gideon Hall
and wife, John Hall and wife, John Hilburn and wife, Jacob Rowe and wife, and some others. The church languished during
the war, and very nearly went out of existence; but in later years it has revived, and now services are held with considerable
regularity, though it is not yet a strong church.</P>

<P>A Sunday-school was organized ten or twelve years ago, and has been kept up with considerable regularity, numbering, at
present, twenty-five or thirty members.</P>

<P>This township also contains a Congregational church, located in the village of Lock. The. date of its organization has not
been ascertained, but the church is, at present, in a flourishing condition. Messrs. John Dripps, James Sanger, Jesse Smith
and Judge John Van Fossen, are remembered as among the most active and best known of the early politicians of this
township, the latter serving some years as an associate judge of the common pleas court.</P>

<P>Bennington occupies an interior and somewhat isolated position, which may have been instrumental in reducing its
population, which for many years was on the decline.</P>

<P>BOWLING GREEN township was organized in 1808. It is eight miles long from east to west, and two and a half miles
wide, lying wholly within the Refugee tract. Perry county is on the south; Muskingum on the east, Hopewell and Franklin
townships on the north, and Licking on the west. </P>

<P>The Mound Builders left a few-samples of their works within its limits; enough to indicate that it was once the home of the
lost race. There is a stone mound two and a half miles southeast of Linnville, of medium size, and one earth mound near it,
both being near the center of the township, east and west. There is also a mound at Amsterdam of no very
great--dimensions; and an earth mound on the farm of John Hamilton, adjoining Brownsville on the northeast, of oblong
form, eighty-five yards in circumference at its base and fifteen feet high.</P>

<P>The township has no authentic Indian history, but there is plenty of evidence that the Indians roamed freely over it in the
pre-historic times, and probably had a more or less permanent occupancy of it. Tradition and the general belief locate the
red man on all sides of it, and without doubt it was used extensively as a hunting ground by the Delawares and other
nations and tribes that once held undisputed possession here.</P>

<P>Agriculturally and topographically considered the township is rolling, or somewhat hilly, although it has some level or
bottom lands, very fertile, particularly along the little streams which flow through it, southwardly, towards Jonathan's creek,
or the Moxahala, as the Indians called it, whose tributaries they are. It was originally well timbered, the growth being
principally oak, hickory and walnut. It is generally fertile, producing corn and the cereals and grass bountifully. There is
little, if any, land in the township that is not tillable. All the rain that falls upon its surface flows into the Muskingum river
through the Moxahala.</P>

<P>The first settlement of Bowling Green township was made in 1802, at what is called "Little Bowling Green," about a mile
south of Linnville, on a tributary of Jonathan's creek, by some frontiersmen from Western Virginia, whose names were
Michael Thorn, Frederick Myers, and Henry Neff.</P>

<P>John Harris and Andrew Myers, also Virginians, settled herein 1803, and William Harris, Moses  Meeks, Adam and John
Myers, and Charles Howard 1804. The latter was a school-teacher by profession, and taught the first school in the
township.</P>

<P>Those who came after 1804, were Edward Taylor, William Taylor, Joseph Taylor, Jacob Storts, Henry Alexander, John
Berry, Joseph McMullin, Rev. Levi Shinn, Nathan Shipps, Elijah Nichols, George Moyer, James Clark, Robert Orr, Landon
Warfield, William Chapman, Samuel Parr, Henry Bickell, Alexander McClelland, Walter Roberts, John Weedman, Mr.
Mervin, Willis Lake, sr.,</P>

</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>402 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jacob and Adam Brown, and John Dickinson. Mr. William Harris came to this township in 1804, and, though he lived a
while in Franklin township, probably resided more years in this township than any other person.</P>

<P>Mr. Solomon Myers was the son of Andrew Myers, one of the immigrants of 1803, and was brought to the "Little Bowling
Green" from near Morgantown, Monongalia county, western Virginia, where he was born in 1788.</P>

<P>Settlers continued to flock into the township rapidly, locating themselves in different neighborhoods, so that when the
county was organized in 1808, it was deemed advisable by the county commissioners to organize the people of these
several settlements into a separate township.</P>

<P>It was the fourth township organized in order of time, and the second after the county was organized-Hanover, only,
preceding it. Licking and Granville had been some time organized as townships in Fairfield county.</P>

<P>The little prairie a mile south of Linnville was called "Little Bowling Green," from its resemblance to the Bowling Green
on the Licking, four miles below Newark. It gave name to the stream running through it, and thus, also, furnished a name,
ultimately, for the township.</P>

<P>Samuel Parr, and many other settlers who came to this township before the year 1815, were from the State of
Pennsylvania., mostly from Fayette county.</P>

<P>The National road runs through the township from east to west along the northern boundary. It was surveyed, located and
constructed between the years 1825 to 1833. The towns of Brownsville and Linnville were laid out soon after the final
location of the road; the former by Adam Brown, who named it after himself, and the latter by Samuel Parr, who named it
after Adam Linn, who was then about to establish himself there as its first merchant. Brownsville grew rapidly at first, but
has been about stationary in later years. It is a post town of about four hundred and fifty inhabitants. Linnville is a post
town of about one hundred inhabitants.</P>

<P>Amsterdam, half of which is in Bowling Green township, was also brought into existence after the location and during the
construction of the National road, Abraham Boring and George Barnes being its proprietors.</P>

<P>The National road for twenty years attracted much travel to it, both of emigrants and general travelers, which gave the
villages located upon it an appearance of considerable life and thrift. Regular lines of daily four-horse stages were run in
those days, and sometimes they had an additional opposition line, carrying on a very vigorous competition with the regular
mail line, which added greatly to the liveliness of. the villages along the road. A daily "Pony Express line," also passed over
the National road during a portion of the years 1836 and 1837, which, for the time being, increased the excitement and the
interest in the villages along the road, and tended to vary the monotony of village life. This pony express was established by
Hon. Amos Kendall, the energetic postmaster general, for the purpose of carrying valuable letters, drafts, small packages
and important newspaper slips. Its speed was more than ten miles per hour, being twice that of the mail stage; the schedule
time from Zanesville to Columbus (fifty-four miles) being five hours, and the postage on matter carried by it was
enormously high. Mr. Smucker remembers receiving a newspaper slip, brought by it, containing President VanBuren's
inaugural address, in March, 1837, on which the postage was seventy-five cents. Such a paper by regular mail would cost
two cents. The express ponies were ridden by boys, and put through on a fast gallop, or "half-run," the relays being five
miles apart. The small saddle-bags which contained the express matter were fastened to the saddle, and, at the end of each
run, the saddle and bags were almost instantly transferred from the exhausted, foaming pony, to a fresh one, the rider
mounted upon him, and rode away at full speed, with a delay of not more than a minute. The stations in Licking county
were Brownsville, Linnvilie, Etniers, Luray, and Etna.</P>

<P>A former citizen of Newark, H. S. Manon, and a Mr. Jones, were pony express contractors from Zanesville to Columbus,
and Mr. A. B. Dumm, of Newark, then a lad living in Brownsville, rode from Zanesville to Etniers, near Jacksontown. He
said that he once, in an emergency, rode from Zanesville to Columbus in three hours and forty-five </P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 403</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>minutes, the rider from Etniers to Columbus being sick. Once when behind time he rode from Etniers to Zanesville
(twenty-six miles) in less than an hour and a half. There were five relays of horses on his .route. The enterprise proving
unprofitable, was abandoned in 1837. A short time before the Union and Central Pacific railroads were constructed, the
pony express was used with success in carrying the mail from the States across the plains and over the mountains to
California; and even yet, where the railroad has not penetrated, these pony express lines are used with much benefit and
profit, in the western territories and States.</P>

<P>Old settlers look back with a sigh of regret at those stage-coach days, which have passed away forever. When the railroads
came into use emigrants, travelers and four-horse coaches, abandoned the pike, and the little towns along the road became
dull and ceased to grow.</P>

<P>The first religious society organized in Bowling Green township was effected by the Methodists about sixty years ago, at
the house of Samuel Parr. Revs. Jesse Stoneman and Levi Shinn preached occasionally, before the organization of this
society, at the house of Mr. James Clarke, who lived in the southern part of the township, where, also, a class was formed at
an early day. Revs. Asa Shinn, Robert Manley, Ralph Lotspeitch and James Quinn are believed to have preached at Mr.
Clarke's in early times. In 1807 Rev. Jesse Stoneman preached a funeral discourse in Bowling Green probably the first
funeral sermon preached in the township.</P>

<P>In 1821 the society formed at the house of Mr, Parr, made an effort to build a hewed log--church; which, however, was
never completed, and. little,  at all, used as a church. About the year 1832 this society erected a small but neat. frame
church in Linnville, which, after a number of years, they sold to the Catholics. In the year 1839 they erected, on a lot
adjoining Linnville, the frame structure they yet occupy. The .membership is half a hundred or more, and a live
Sabbath-school is connected with the church</P>

<P>The Methodist Episcopal church in Brownsville is one of the earlier societies. It was first organized in 1816 at the residence
of Widow Dickinson, one and a half miles north of Brownsville, in Hopewell township, by Rev. James Quinn, where, in
1818, they built a hewed log church which they occupied until 1830, when the society was transferred to Brownsville,
where they erected a small, brick church. This church was occupied until about thirty-five years ago, when the society
erected a large, fine frame edifice, yet occupied. The membership numbers something less than one hundred; and the same
may be said of the active and flourishing Sabbath-school. </P>

<P>The Protestant Methodist church, of Brownsville, was organized about 1830, and soon there after built a small frame
church. In 1847 they erected a still larger church edifice, which is still occupied. It has very generally been a flourishing and
influential church. A large and active Sunday-school is connected with it, and the membership of the church. is something
less than one hundred.</P>

<P>About 1840 the Roman Catholics organized a church in Linnville, and bought the small edifice recently vacated by the
Methodist society, who had just completed their new church west of and adjoining the town. This Catholic society, after
some years, was dissolved, and the church diverted from sacred to secular uses.</P>

<P>The Presbyterian church in Brownsville was organized by Rev. W. M. Robinson, in 1845, with eleven members. The
present church edifice, a good brick building, was erected in 1846.Robert Hamilton and William Black were first elders. </P>

<P>Mr. Robinson continued preaching several years in this church. At first there were but three or four Presbyterian families,
and he received, at this place, less than fifty dollars a year support,. yet it soon became more encouraging, and before he
resigned the charge in 1855, he received three hundred dollars per annum from this congregation which had increased to
eighty-four members. Mr.  Robinson was succeeded by Revs. W. B. Tidball, H. R. Peairs, Alexander R. Hamilton, L. B. W.
Shryock, M. M. Travis, Mr. White, and others.  A Sabbath-school has been connected with the church since its
organization.</P>

<P>There is a Baptist church about half a mile east, of Linnville, erected in 1848,. which is part of or, an appendage to the
Friendship, or Old School Baptist, church at Hog run, in Licking</P>

<P>The United Brethren have a small church in Amsterdam, which stands on the line between Franklin and this township. The
society is small, many of the members having united with the society at Jacksontown.</P>

<P>The Christian Union denomination organized a society in 1865, holding its meeting in a schoolhouse in Linnville. The
ministers have been Revs. A. S. Biddison, William Henslee, Benjamin Green and Mr. Underwood. They sustain a Sabbath
school and pulpit ministrations, with a good degree of regularity. Isaac Orr, James Brown, James Lamp, John P. Switzer,
George Clark and John Dusthimer, were among the original members of this church.</P>

<P>In addition to the pioneer preachers of Bowling Green already named, are the following: Revs. J. W. Patterson, Jacob
Young, Charles Waddle, Mr. McElroy, Abner Goff, Jacob Myers, Joseph Carper, Martin Fate, Mr. McCracken, W. B.
Evans, C. Springer, George Brown, George Debolt, James Hooper, Jacob Hooper, Samuel Hamilton, Leroy Swormsted and
J. Gilruth.</P>

<P>The early-time justices of the peace in this township, were Moses Meeks, Adam Winegardner, John Bartholomew,
Alexander Morrison, William Taylor, Charles Bradford, Joseph McMullen, William Armstrong, Samuel Parr and Baltus
Emory, who served about in the order named.</P>

<P>The township is divided into six school districts, each having a good school building. It is also united with Franklin
township in a fractional district.</P>

<P>There are but two post offices in the township Brownsville and Linnville. The office in each place was established about
fifty-years ago, and the postmasters were as follows, about in the order named: Brownsville--Moses Brotherlin, John F.
Bane, George H. Hood, John Oldham, John F. Bane, Alexander Flowers, O. M. Hamilton, John Oldham, George L.
Buckingham, O. M. Hamilton, C. A. Roberts, C. F. Prior and  John H. Bell, the present incumbent. Linnville-Adam Linn,
William Tracy, William Orr, David Gilland, Thomas Lonon, David Harris, Summerfield Tippett,  D. C. Harris and W. C.
Orr. The number of inhabitants in this township in 1830, was 1,768; in 1840, 1,464; in 1850, 1,538; in 1860, 1,213; in
1880, 926.</P>

<P>The large population in 1830 was owing to the fact that many families, who were then engaged in the construction of the
National road, had but a temporary residence, and were gone when the census of 1840 was taken; however it will be seen
there has been a gradual falling off in population at every census, in which fact lies food for thought.</P>

<P>The township vote in presidential elections has been as follows: In 1856, for James Buchanan, 145; for J. C. Fremont, 106;
Milliard Filmore, 2. In 1860, Stephen A. Douglas, 138; Abraham Lincoln, 90; J. C. Breckenridge, 15; John Bell, 2. In 1864,
George B. McClellan, 147; Abraham Lincoln, 66. In 1868, Horatio Seymour, 162; General Grant, 80. In 1876, Samuel J.
Tilden, 164; R. B. Hayes, 69. The totals were, 253, 245, 213; 242, 233</P>

<P>John Yontz and Dr. Walter B. Morris, were among the most conspicuous and influential politicians in the township, and
both attained to the distinction of representatives in the State legislature-the former in 1835-'36-'37 ; and the latter in 1839-40- '41. They were not early settlers and did not remain in the county many years. The former was identified with the
opposition stage interest, which kept up such a lively competition with the regular Neil and Moore Ohio mail stage
company, for quite a length of time on the National road. His gentlemanly bearing, fine address, remarkable sauvity of
manners, affable deportment, and attractive presence, made him exceedingly popular, and gave him great power over his
fellows. He died two years ago in California. Dr. Morris moved to Missouri. Bowling Green has, also, furnished a
representative in the legislature in the person of William Parr, a native of the township.</P>

<P>A good degree of thrift and prosperity, the result of industry and frugality, have marked the history of the people- of
Bowling Green township. Their schools and churches, as will be seen, are numerous and well sustained, and the people
could not well fail to reach the average standard, in the practice of the higher virtues and Christian graces.</P>

<P>ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION-ORIGIN OF THE NAME-TOPOGRAPHY-WORKS OF THE MOUND
BUILDERS-PRE-HISTORIC REMAINS-THE BURLINGTON STORM-THE PIONEERS-HOMER-THE
CHURCHES-NOTABLE PEOPLE.</P>

<P>THIS township was organized in 1817. It lies on the northern border, adjoining Knox county, between Bennington on the
west, Washington on the east, and McKean on the south.</P>

<P>It is said that Colonel Wait Wright treated the "boys" to two gallons of whiskey for the privilege of naming the township,
and thereupon called it after his native place in Vermont.</P>

<P>It is well watered-Otter creek and the North fork, about equal in size, uniting a little above the residence of Justus Taylor,
near the village of Homer, the latter taking an easterly course to Washington township. Lake fork rises in Bennington and
flows east nearly through the center of Burlington. The surface is gently undulating, except in the district known as
"Egypt," in the southeast, which is somewhat hilly. The Soil of the larger portion partakes of yellow clay, and is adapted to
the growth of wheat and other small grains, which, taken in connection with the alluvial, corn producing bottom land,
skirting the streams, creates that variety of soil calculated to invite the agriculturalist. No portion of it is so broken as to
prevent cultivation. Within the limits of Burlington are, or were, seven or more of those mysterious mounds for which the
county is noted, and which continue to puzzle the antiquarian. One is on the farm formerly owned by Robert Fulton, one
mile west of Homer; another on the farm owned by the heirs of John Butcher; and two on the farm formerly owned by
Robert Hunter. Mr. Hunter is dead, and the farm is now owned by Jacob Yocum. There were three mounds here, but one of
them was plowed away and leveled in the preparation of the ground upon which to build the house, so that two only remain
upon this place. Under the center of one of these was discovered, some years since, a circular building of stone, about ten
feet in diameter and three feet in height, regularly built, dome shaped, and having on the top as a keystone a large stone
familiarly known as a "nigger head." Much curiosity was excited as to its contents, but when opened it was found to contain
nothing of value. There is another mound on the farm formerly owned by McKnight, one mile west of Utica, which is eight
or ten feet in height and twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter at the base. The farm upon which it is located is now owned
by James. Hanger; but the largest and most entire is at the village of Homer, on the farm and close to the residence of
Edwin Williams, esq.; this has recently been measured and found to be about thirty rods in circumference at the base, and
nearly thirty feet in height, having, as is usual, a hollow place at the summit, about twenty-five feet across. Perhaps fifty
years ago, a party of five or six settlers agreed to examine this mound in search of curiosities. They dug down about fifteen
feet, but found nothing of value.</P>

<P>A mound of ordinary size not long ago had an existence on the farm of Mr. Woodruff, three fourths of a mile west of
Homer. This mound has been graded down, but near it yet remains the depression or "sink" from which it is believed the
dirt was taken for this mound. This place is overgrown with bushes, and is sometimes filled with water.</P>

<P>The soil in the vicinity of Homer seems to have been favorable for the works of the Mound Builders, being somewhat
sandy.</P>

<P>In 1824, near an old fort, the outlines of which are still visible, on the bank of the creek adjoining</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>406 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>the Homer cemetery, a very large human skeleton was found. It is stated that the jaw-bone would go over the face of the
largest man present, with two hands placed between. This might have been some pre-historical Indian chief, and if he
wielded influence and power in proportion to his size, he was a mighty man among the red men.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In 1815, while digging a mill-race on the western line of the township, some enormous bones were unearthed; among
others, a rib over five feet .in length; another bone as large around as a wagon hub, and a tooth two and one-half inches
broad, one and a half inches thick, and five or six inches in length, doubtless the remains of some antediluvian animal Mr.
William Spencer, speaking in 1876, of the earthwork last mentioned, says it is on the farm of Mr. Joseph Conard, and is a
regular circle about eighty-five feet in diameter, with the ditch on the inside of the embankment. It is only twelve or fifteen
inches in height, with a gate, or entrance, twelve feet wide, facing the east. The mound in the center of this embankment is
at least thirty feet in diameter, thirty inches high, and seems to have always been higher than the circular wall. A few oak
trees stand on the embankment, from eighteen inches to two and a half feet in diameter. No other works are connected with
this, so far as can be seen. This earthwork evidently belongs to the same class of works as the "Old Port" near Newark, and
known as "Sacred Inclosures."</P>

<P>One of the most important events in the history of this county was the occurrence of what is known as "The Burlington
Storm." ' Its effects were more severely felt in this township than any other, hence its name; and its history may properly be
written here. It occurred on the eighteenth of May, 1825; and was one of the most violent tornadoes ever known in Ohio.
The following description of it is from "Howe's Historical Collections," and the account is believed to be authentic.</P>

<P>"It commenced between the hours of one and two P. M., in the southeast part of Delaware county. After passing a few
miles upon the surface of the ground, in an easterly direction, it appeared to rise so high from the earth that the tallest trees
were not affected. It then again descended to the earth, and with greatly increased violence and force, proceeded through the
townships of Bennington and Burlington, in Licking county, then passed into Knox, and thence into Coshocton county. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"It crossed the road from Newark to Mt. Vernon, a short distance above Utica, where its violence was such as to prostrate
early all the trees, large and small, that stood in its track, which was several hundred yards wide. Its general course was a
little north of east. For force and violence of wind this storm has rarely been surpassed in any country in the same latitude.
Forests and orchards were completely uprooted and leveled; buildings blown down, scattered in every direction, and carried
by the force of the mind many miles distant; cattle were taken from the ground and carried one hundred rods or more. The
creek, which had been swollen by recent rains, had but little water in its bed after the storm passed. The roads and fields
recently plowed were quite muddy from recent rains; but, after the storm passed by, both roads and fields were clean and
dry. Its track through Licking county was from one-third to three-fifths of a mile wide, but became wider as it advanced to
the eastward. Those who were so fortunate as to be witnesses of its progress, without being victims of its fury, represent the
appearance of fragments of trees, buildings and limbs, high in the air, to resemble large numbers of birds, such as buzzards
and ravens.</P>

<P>"The ground also seemed to tremble, as is asserted by many credible persons, who were at the time a mile from the track of
the tornado. The roar of the wind, the trembling of the ground, and the crash of falling timbers and buildings, are
represented by all who were witnesses as being peculiarly dreadful."</P>

<P>Colonel Wright, and others who witnessed its progress, think it advanced at the rate of a mile per minute, and did not last
more than a minute and a half or two minutes. The cloud was exceedingly black, and sometimes bore hard upon the ground,
and at others seemed to rise a little above the surface. One peculiarity was that the fallen timber lay in every direction, so
that the course of the storm could' not be determined from the position of the fallen trees.</P>

<P>Many incidents are related by the inhabitants, calculated to illustrate the power and terrors of the storm. A chain, three or
four feet long, of the size of a plow-chain, was taken from the ground near the house of John McClintock, carried about
half a mile, and lodged in the top of a sugar-tree stub about twenty-five feet from the ground.'</P>

<P>An ox belonging to Colonel Wait Wright, was carried about eighty rods, and left unhurt, although surrounded by fallen
timber so that it required several hours chopping to release him. A cow, also, was taken from the same field, carried about
forty rods, and lodged in the top of a tree, which was blown down, and when found, was dead, and about eight feet from the
ground. Whether the cow was blown against the tree-top after it fell, or</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 407</STRONG></P>

<P>was lodged in it before, could not be determined. A heavy ox-cart was taken from the yard of Colonel Wright, carried about
forty rods, and struck the ground with such force as to break the axle, and entirely demolish one wheel.</P>

<P>A son of Colonel Wright, upwards of fourteen years of age, was standing in the house, holding the door. The house which
was built of logs, was torn to pieces, and the lad thrown with such violence across the room as to kill him instantly. A coat
hanging in the same room, was found the following November in Coshocton county, more than forty miles distant, and was
afterward brought to Burlington and identified by Colonel Wright's family. Other articles, such as shingles, pieces of timber
and furniture, were carried twenty and thirty miles. Miss Sarah Robb, about twelve years of age, was taken from her father's
house, and carried some distance. She could not tell how far; but when consciousness returned, found herself about forty
rods from the house, and walking toward it. She was much bruised, but not very greatly injured. The family of a Mr. Vance,
on seeing the storm approaching, fled from the house to the orchard adjoining. The upper part of the house was blown off
and through the orchard, the lower part remaining. Two sons of Mr. Vance were killed, one immediately, and the other died
in a day or two from wounds; these and the son of Colonel Wright were all the lives known to have been lost in the storm.
A house built of large logs, in which was a family, and which a number of workmen had entered for shelter from the storm,
was raised up on one side, and rolled off the spot where it stood, without injuring any one. A yoke of oxen belonging to
William H. Cooley, were standing in the field, and after the storm, were found completely enclosed and covered with fallen
timber, so that they were not released until the next day, but were not essentially injured.</P>

<P>A black walnut tree, two and a half feet in diameter, which had lain on the ground many years, and become embedded in
the earth to nearly one-half its size, was taken from its bed, carried across the creek, and left about thirty rods from its
former location.</P>

<P>A crockery crate, in which several fowls were confined, was carried by the wind several miles, and, strange to relate, with
its contents set down without injury.</P>

<P>Instances could be multiplied, but it is unnecessary; the evidence is clear that it was one of the most violent storms on
record.</P>

<P>The first settlers in the township, as nearly as can now be ascertained, were James Dunlap, Cornelius Vanausdal, Henry
Oldacre, Nathan Conard, John Johnson, Jonathan Beaty, Hugh McKindley, Adam Patterson, John Dixon and Thomas
Dixon in 1806; David Wallace, J. Helphry, Jesse Van Fossen, John Chonner, James Butcher, James Dickey and Jesse
Smith in 1808; George McCrary, Timothy Chapman, James, John and Abner McLain, Thomas Scott and Henry McKindley
about 1810; and a little later Wait Wright, Samuel Edmon, Adam Patterson, Van Simmons, Thomas Bare and Ezra Mead.</P>

<P>In 1806 the wolves and bears were in the majority.</P>

<P>In 1810 the settlers erected a block-house as a defence against the Indians. It was on "Indian path," near the Dunlap
residence, on the road from Utica to Johnstown.</P>

<P>John Chonner built the first mill in the township and taught the first Sabbath school, and was a leading citizen.</P>

<P>The village of Homer was originally called Burlington; but when the post office was established it was found necessary to
change its name, and the present name was chosen. It was laid out by John Chonner in 1816, and now contains about three
hundred inhabitants; has a large school-house, three churches, two dry goods stores, kept by S. L. Blue and Elmer Scott,
two hotels, two blacksmith shops, one wagon shot), one cabinet shop, and the usual number of mechanical establishments.</P>

<P>The Congregational church (now Presbyterian) was organized May 5, 1828, by Rev. Jacob Little, of Granville. The
examining committee were Deacon Amass Howe, of Granville,. Deacon Orin Barnes, of St. Albans, Deacon Eliseus
Fowler, of Hartford, and Samuel W. Rose, of Granville, a licentiate of Lancaster presbytery, who was its first minister.
They have a good membership, a flourishing Sabbath-school, and a neat, commodious house of worship. This church is not
strong, the present membership being twenty or more. Their</P>

<P><HR>
</P>


<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>408 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>first church building stood where the Union schoolhouse now stands. It was then Old School Presbyterian. Subsequently it
united with the new school, and they erected the present building.</P>

<P>The Baptist church edifice was finished July 9, 1832, and dedicated July 21, 1832, by Rev. Owen Owens. They formerly
had a large membership, but many families have removed, and their places have not been filled; they are now
comparatively few in number. The original members of this church organization were John Esthell, Titus Knox, Benjamin
Warner, Lewis Hatch, Mabel Thrall, Mariah Smith, Mary Woods, Ruth Warner, Mary Emerson, Mary Pugh, Susannah
Hatch, Peggy A. Knox, Elizabeth Galer, Peter Galer, Leonard Woods, Barbara Wheeler, Jacob Galer, Daniel Galer, Eliza
Hard, Mary Esthell, Ann Tellis, Elizabeth Tellis, Elizabeth Warner, Howard Phillips, Elizabeth Phillips, and David Brown.
The first church building was erected soon after the church was organized. It was a frame building, and was occasionally
added to and repaired. It is yet standing, and is used for a carpenter shop. The present building, a frame, was erected about
thirty years ago. It has recently been repaired and painted. Services are held here every two weeks. The membership is
about thirty three. This is what is known as New School Baptist, which admits the Sunday school as part of their religious
worship. A school of this kind was early established, and is yet maintained.</P>

<P>The Methodists held their early meetings in the cabins of the members, and afterward in the log school-houses that began,
soon after the first settlement, to spring up here and there all over the country. Their first church edifice in this township
was erected about 1834, and cost about one thousand dollars. This building was in use nearly thirty-five years. The
congregation began the erection of the present church in 1868, and it was dedicated June 25, 1871, by Rev. M. Collyer. It is
a substantial structure, large, handsome, will finished, and furnished in the most approved modern style, and cost about
twenty-five hundred dollars. They have a membership of seventy-five, a good Sabbath-school, numbering one hundred
pupils, and the church is in a prosperous condition.</P>

<P>For many years the preachers to this class were the itinerant ministers sent out by the church conference, who had regular
preaching places in various parts of this and other counties. Among the original members of the class were Thomas
Callihan, Benjamin Belt, David Weiant, Solomon Wheeler, Nathan Conard, Isaac Vanosdoll, David Watson, Henry
Overholt, and James Houck.</P>

<P>Homer was the native place of Major General William S. Rosecranz, his father residing here as farmer, merchant and
tavern keeper. It is also the home of the venerable William Knowles, a poet of considerable ability.</P>

<P>"Rugged as Time's early dawn,</P>

<P>Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun."</P>

<P>EDEN township lies in the northeastern part of the county and is essentially a township of farmers, there being no town
within its limits. It is well watered by the Rocky fork and its tributaries, the main body of which stream passes diagonally
across the township from north to south, near its center.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>If any works of the Mound Builders existed in this township, they have almost, if not entirely, disappeared. The soil was
not well adapted to the erection of their works, being composed of rocks and clay. This mysterious people clung closely, it
appears, to sandy, loamy soil, in the erection of their works.</P>

<P>No Indian history has been handed down, but tradition has it that the Indians encamped on the Bowling Green used this as a
hunting ground.</P>

<P>The face of the country is broken and hilly, in some places assuming the dignity and grandeur of mountains; the valleys are
generally narrow and very fertile. In its primitive state the oak predominated in the-forest, considerable chestnut was also
found, and the valley s were occupied .by sugar and shell-bark hickory; and the entire township was covered with fruits,
flowering shrubs, and trees of smaller growth. The abundance of fruits, nuts, and wild game, made it desirable hunting
ground, and rendered it comparatively easy for the pioneers to support their families until the forest should be cleared away.</P>

<P>There are a great number of springs in every direction, bursting from the, hillsides, and the water flowing from these form a
network of small streams; these form the creeks which, after flowing in tortuous courses through narrow valleys find their
outlet in the wild and pretty Rocky fork. Long run, one of the* larger tributaries of the Rocky fork in this township, rises in
its northeastern corner, and flowing south along its eastern border, joins the Rocky fork in the northern part of Mary Ann
township. Lost run rises in the southwestern part of this township, several branches of it uniting near the United Brethren
church, and flowing south in Mary Ann township. A high range of hills passes across the township from northwest to
southeast in its western part, dividing the waters of the Rocky fork from those of Lost run and the North fork of Licking.
The springs before mentioned are more numerous in this township than in any other in the county, with the possible
exception of Fallsbury.</P>

<P>The natural scenery is picturesque, and in many places on the Rocky fork approaches the sublime. About one mile north of
the south line of Eden, on either side of the road, like two grim sentinels, stand the "Picture rocks," in the midst of scenery
so wild and rugged as to attract pleasure parties from Newark and other places.</P>

<P>Rocky fork is appropriately named. Exclusive of the regular mountain ranges, scenery so wild and rugged will seldom be
found. All along this stream through Mary Ann and Eden, in every successive mile, the beholder is filled with wonder and
amazement at the new and varied phases of Nature's face. Coming up from the south along this stream,. over a narrow,
winding mountain road, these Picture rocks seem, as it were, to be the "cap sheaf" of all the rugged beauty below; yet this
mountainous scenery continues through the entire township along this stream. Turning to the right - a little south of Picture
rocks, a narrow, winding by-road leads over the hills of Long run,</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>410 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>and in a short time "Rain rock" is reached. This is a spot of much natural beauty. Nothing of special importance is observed
from the roadway, which passes directly over the top of Rain rock. Descending into a gloomy gorge, filled with trees and
flowering shrubs, with huge sand-rocks piled promiscuously about on the hill-sides, a place that can only be reached by a
footman, the Rain rocks and their accompaniments come into view. This is merely a huge, seamed sand rock that juts from
the hill-side, over which the road passes, extending into the gorge thirty or forty feet, its under surface, so much of it as can
be seen, being about one hundred feet long by thirty or forty feet wide. This surface appears elevated, at the highest part,
some twenty feet or. more above the surface of the ground beneath, but sloping slightly until it rests upon a solid wall of
sand rock that supports it. It forms a gloomy, cavernous-looking excavation, and a shelter where a hundred people or more
might escape from a storm. In various places through the crevices of this rock-roof, clear, sparkling spring water issues, and
keeps up an incessant dropping, year after year, upon the sand beneath, hence the name Rain rock. In winter this dropping
water forms icicles, often reaching from the ground to the surface of the rock, making very beautiful pyramids of ice.</P>

<P>This is also a pleasure resort. Pleasure parties from Newark and other places sometimes camp out here for days, and ramble
about among these picturesque hills. Meetings of various kinds are also held here, and rude plank seats are here arranged
for the accommodation of an audience in front of which, and at a little distance from Rain rock, is a flat rock, four or five
feet high, and ten or twelve feet in diameter across the top, with a smooth surface, known as "Pulpit rock," upon which the
speaker stands, and upon which several chairs may be placed for the accommodation o distinguished visitors. In rear of the 
"Audience room" and fronting Pulpit rock, is a huge mass o perpendicular rocks. These are  "rent and riven" as by thunder
bolts; the interstices being filled wit laurel bushes, and the edges  rimmed with ferns causing this mass of rocks, during the
proper season, to look like an immense flower-pot. It is altogether a very pretty and healthful resort.</P>

<P>In its primitive condition, before the heavy hand of man was laid upon its timber and soil, this township must have been a
perfect Garden of Eden for the hunter both red and white. Game of every description was plenty and continued to be plenty
long after it was driven out of the more desirable parts of the county. Wild animals found a sure and safe retreat among
these hills and rocks.</P>

<P>The township was organized in 1822, out of territory originally included in Mary Ann.</P>

<P>The pioneers were William Shannon, Jesse Oldaker and Ebenezer Brown, who settled in the west half of the township in
the spring of 1813. Shannon came from Franklin county Pennsylvania; Oldaker from the Shenandoah Valley, and Brown
from Washington county, Pennsylvania. These formed the nucleus of what is now Eden township. They were soon
followed by Homeward Mariott, William Mitchell, Aaron Brown, Robert McLaughlin, James Starrett, Rev. James
Cunningham, James Porter, Charles McFadden, Elisha McFadden, James W. Colville, Jordan Hall, David Moats and W.
Henthorn.</P>

<P>The erection of a grist mill-on the upper waters of the Rocky fork, by Ebenezer Brown, at a very early period, soon
followed by the erection of another one mile below, by Honorable William Mitchell, were noteworthy events, and
contributed largely to the comfort and convenience of the early settlers of Eden, Mary Ann, and portions of Knox county.
The Mitchell mill is yet running, having changed hands several times. It is now owned by John Stevenson. Quite a number
of mills, both saw- and grist-mills, have been erected at various places along the Rocky fork, in this township; few are now,
however, in running order. This stream furnished very good mill-power, and seldom went dry, as it is fed largely by
springs.</P>

<P>About 1854, a woollen factory was erected by Walter B. Finney, about a mile below the Mitchell mill. It was in operation
about seven years when it was destroyed by fire. Mr. Finney, who is yet ' living, also erected a saw-mill. in connection with
his woollen factory, which is yet running. A mill also had an existence in an early day near the - Long Run post office, in
the eastern part of the township, but its wheels have not been turning for some years.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY - 411</STRONG></P>

<P>The first road through this township was, probably, the old State road, now known as the Martinsburgh and Newark road,
which passes across the township from north to .south on the west side of the Rocky fork, and was much used in early days
by travelers from Newark to Mt. Vernon, Martinsburgh and points further north.</P>

<P>Coal crops out in places among the hills in the vicinity of Rocky fork, but has not yet been found in workable veins.</P>

<P>It has been stated that there were no villages in this township, and this is, probably, the case, though some attempts have
been made in this direction.</P>

<P>James Shannon undertook to build a town in the northwestern part of the township, on the Rocky fork, in the vicinity of a
very small lake, about 1856. He erected a store-room, put in ,a stock of goods, and called the place Oberlin. Attempts were
also made to get a regular post office, but without success, though letters are left at the store for people in that
neighborhood. This store has been conducted at different times by different parties, but during the past year (1880) it was
destroyed by fire. A new building, however, has been erected and the store continued. In addition to this, there is a
blacksmith shop, kept by John Hughes, and three or four dwellings. There was also a store on the farm of Elzey Dush about
twenty years ago, in the eastern part of the township. There is also a cluster of houses here-three or four.</P>

<P>The second regular post office in the township was established in 1858, by James W. Colville, who was the first
postmaster. It was kept in his dwelling house, where it is yet kept, his son being the present postmaster. This is the Long
Run office. There is no town there-nothing but Mr. Colville's residence, the church, and ruins of the old mill.</P>

<P>Probably the first school taught in this township was by James Cunningham, near the north line of the township, a short
distance from Oberlin, in an old deserted building that had been erected for a. tannery. The first school-house erected in the
township was probably the one-that stood near the Rocky-fork, about a mile southeast of Oberlin. It was a rude, round log
building, and James Cunningham kept the first school in it. The township is now dotted over with school-houses, the
people having learned that in these and the churches lie the only hope of the Republic.</P>

<P>Eden has furnished to the county two surveyors, William Anderson and James R Anderson, a commissioner, Jordan Hall,
and a representative, William Mitchell.</P>

<P>There are four churches in this township, two United Brethren, one Disciple and one Protestant Methodist.</P>

<P>The-Disciple church was organized in 1829, and was the first church organization of that society in Licking county. It was
organized in the log school-house known as the "Henthorn school house," situated about four miles south of where, in
1834, a fine frame church edifice was erected on the farm of Benjamin Bell, in Knox county. The church was erected on the
line between Knox and Licking counties.</P>

<P>The first disciple preaching in the county was by Elder James Porter at this place in 1829, by whom, also, this congregation
was organized. He was also its first elder, and for some time its ablest and almost only public advocate. He resided in the
vicinity, and perhaps to him more than to any other man, the organization is indebted for its origin, advancement, and
present standing and influence in the community. The members of its first organization were James Porter and wife,
Benjamin Bell, sr., and wife, Elizabeth Bell (wife of Samuel Bell), Stephen Harris and wife, Isaac Henthorn and wife, and
Elisha Stout.</P>

<P>About 1830 a public discussion took place in a log barn belonging to Jesse Oldacre, between Rev. James Gilruth, of the
Methodist Episcopal church, and elder James Porter, on behalf of the Disciples. After this discussion, which seemed to
arouse much interest, the congregation grew rapidly in numbers, and subsequently under the ministerial labors of such
evangelists as James Porter, John Secrist, John Reed, Reuben Davis, John Sargent, James Mitchell, Jesse B. Ferguson,
Arthur Critchfield, James J. Moss, Dr. William Hayes, David G. Mitchel, J. H. Jones, Isaiah Jones, Andrew Burns, Abner
Lemert, Benjamin Bell, jr., David Sharpless, David Weaver, Jonas Hartzel, Ziba Brown, and many others, members were
added until the membership reached more than one hundred and fifty. </P>

<P>Benjamin Bell, jr., upon whom as teacher and elder, rested for ten or twelve years the almost exclusive control of the
church, deserves much credit for his efficiency and faithfulness.</P>

<P>In 1873 this society erected a church in the western part of the township, called Eden chapel. The building is a very good
one, and the society strong in numbers and active. They also maintain an active Sabbath-school. On the opposite side of the
road' from this church is the old burying ground, upon which was erected one of the first churches in the county, but which
has gone out of existence, this Disciple church taking its place. The United Brethren are strong in this township, keeping up
two churches, and near this place one of their first societies was organized, in the cabin of one of the members. This
organization of United Brethren, however, never obtained a firm hold here, but by the help of the few Methodists in the
neighborhood, erected in an early day, a log church, used occasionally by both denominations, when they were able to
secure a minister. The United Brethren organization did not probably continue here more than six or seven years; they were
not able to support a minister, and when the Pleasant Valley church was organized, in the southern part of the township,
they attended there and gave the old log up entirely to the Methodists. The most influential members in the Methodist
Episcopal organization were the Oldacres, two or three families of whom resided in that vicinity. Jesse Oldacre was
prominent and influential in establishing the church and keeping it up, hence it soon came to be known as the "Oldacre
church." The principal members of the original organization of this Methodist class were Jesse Oldacre and wife, William
Shannon and wife, William Oldacre and wife, H. B. Oldacre and wife and Margaret Wilkins. After the death of Jesse
Oldacre and the removal of others of the member from the neighborhood, the church languished.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The old log church building was probably erected about 1848, or before. As before stated the Disciple church has taken the
place, in this neighbor hood, of the other two denominations.</P>

<P>The Pleasant Valley United Brethren church located in the southern part of the township o the old State road, now the
Newark and Martinsburgh road, on the head-waters of Lost Run, and is one of the oldest churches in the county; having
been organized about 1820, or before. Rev. Joshua Montgomery was probably instrumental in the organization of this
church, and was, probably, its first minister. As no records were kept for many of its earlier years, it is hard to get correct
data as to its earliest history; but prior to the erection of the church building, the members probably held their meetings at
the cabin of John Neighbarger, who was one of its earliest and most prominent members. William Shannon and wife also
belonged to this church in its earlier years. The old log church built fifty years ago, or more, was known as the
"Montgomery chapel," and answered all purposes of a church for forty years, or more. The present neat frame building was
erected about 1869. The present membership of this church is about forty.</P>

<P>The Sunday-school was organized at an early day, and has been maintained with considerable regularity, now numbering
forty or fifty members.</P>

<P>In later years, about 1855, a second United Brethren church was organized in this township, called "Edwards'
meeting-house." John Edwards, the Phillipses and some others were the principal movers in its establishment. The church,
a frame building, was erected about 1856, in the eastern part of the township, on Long run, on Mr. Edwards' farm, and is
frequently called the Long Run church. Preaching and a Sunday-school are maintained with considerable regularity.</P>

<P>The Protestant Methodist church located in the southern part of the township, a ,mile or more northeast of the United
Brethren church, was organized about 1857. Stephen Miles, deceased, was the founder of this church. He and his brother
William, Washington Holten, Jacob Sousland and some. others were the first members of this organization. They held their
meetings at first in the school-house, but erected the present church building in 1858. Rev. Hoagland was - probably their
first minister: This is now a strong, - active church, with a membership of fifty or more.</P>

<P>Ten years after the erection of the church, a s Sabbath-school was organized, and is maintained n with considerable success,
the average. attendance - being forty or fifty.</P>

<P>This township is, at this time, divided into farms of ordinary size; is pretty well cleared and fenced, though much of its

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>ETNA TOWNSHIP.</STRONG></P>

<P>LOCATION-TOPOGRAPHY-FIRST SETTLERS AND SETTLEMENTS-ORGANIZATION- TOWNSHIP
OFFICERS-ETNA-WAGRAM THE. CHURCHES</P>

<P>ETNA township is located in the southwestern corner of the county, and wholly in what was known as the "Refugee
Lands."</P>

<P>This is a township of good farming land, and is drained by the tributaries of the South fork of Licking and of the Scioto
river. The former stream passes across the northeast corner and sends its branches through the eastern part of the township,
nearly to its center. The western part. is well watered by the head-waters of Black Lick creek and Sycamore creek, the latter
passing entirely across the township, flowing south into the Little Walnut, whose waters join with those of the Scioto a few
miles above Circleville. The tributaries of the Black Lick in this township bear to the southeast, and the waters find their
way through the Big Walnut to the Scioto. Beyond the town of ,Etna is a ridge passing diagonally across the township from
northwest to southeast, dividing the waters of the Scioto and Licking.</P>

<P>There are no railroads in the township, but the National road passes through it from east to west, and upon this are located
two towns-Wagram and Etna-within the township limits.</P>

<P>This territory, lying as it did far from the usual route of pioneer travel, was not settled until 1815. About that date John
Williams settled on what has since been known as the Matthews farm. Several families of the Nelsons; John Crouch; Jacob,
Peter and George Houser; Messrs. Parkinson, Bergman, Heffner, Denison, Gary, Drake, and John and David Herron, all
began clearing the land before 1816. Isaac Essex was a settler of 1816.</P>

<P>Settlers continued to come in slowly until 1833, when the township was organized-being the last township organized in the
county-and the first election held at the house of John Henthorn, in Etna, June 22d of that year. R. O. Baldwin, John Nelson
and Benjamin Grable were elected the first trustees; John Henthorn, clerk; N. R. Usher, treasurer; William Smith. and
George Wells, constables; Richard Lamson, George Wells, William Moore and Hiram Sinsabaugh, supervisors; Thomas
M. Donahue and Isaac Essex, overseers of the poor, and Henry Spangler, Jonathan Grable and Dennis Smoke, fence
viewers. These were all prominent and influential men in the township during their lives.</P>

<P>As originally laid out, Etna was nine and a half miles long from east to west-and two and a half miles wide; but some time
after 1850, one-half mile was taken off the east end and added to Harrison township.</P>

<P>By the township records, it appears that the trustees divided the township into five school districts, and into four road
districts, March 3, 1834 At that time the United States government was constructing the National road. John Henthom was
then acting justice of the peace; Ambrose Meeker, Benjamin Grable and Jonathan Glendenning, township trustees; Robert
Clum, clerk; Tracy Scott, treasurer, and Henry Niswander, Hiram Buell and John Murphy fence viewers </P>

<P>JOHN SNIDER, Constable.</P>

<P>June 5, 1834.</P>

<P>The charges of Constable Snider, compared with those of the present day, are somewhat astonishing.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"September 22nd, the trustees met at the office of John Henthorn to appoint a constable to fill the vacancy occasioned by
the death of John Snider, and the doctor, Hiram Buell, received the appointment.</P>

<P>'November 11th of the same year, Moses Cheney was appointed constable as successor to Dr. Buell, who, through sickness
or inability, was unable to perform the duties of the office.</P>

<P>"On the sixth of April, 1835, the following civil officers were elected in this township: Henry Spangler, Richard Lamson
and Benjamin Grable, trustees; Robert Clum, clerk; Tracy Scott, treasurer; Moses Cheney and Thomas H. Stewart,
constables. The supervisors were, No. 1, Adam Egolf; No. 2, Basil Brown; NO. 3, Moses Cheney; NO. 4, Richard Lamson;
No. 5. Henry Niswander. The overseers of the poor were John Henthorn and Thomas Marshall, and the fence viewers were.
William Mitchell, jr., George Maxfield and Jacob Shaff."</P>

<P>Richard Lamson was commissioned a justice of the peace, October 19, 1835, which office he held, in connection with that
of postmaster, with credit to himself and the community, until the infirmities of age obliged him to relinquish them;
probably about 1848.</P>

<P>The town of Carthage-since called Etna-was laid out by Lyman Terrell, its original proprietor, in 1832. The National road
was then in process of construction, and it was laid out upon its proposed line, it being finished to this point in 1833-4. Like
many other towns laid out upon this great thoroughfare it had "great expectations," which, however, as in the case of most
other towns upon the road, were not realized. Settlers followed the line of the road rapidly, and soon filled up the towns and
townships along the line. It required a large amount of money to build the road, and no inconsiderable portion of this was
spent among the inhabitants, and was considered almost a Godsend, that article being extremely scarce in those days.</P>

<P>Great impetus was given to building in the small towns, and from the fact that it was supposed that travel would
immediately become so great as to require unlimited accommodations, in Etna nearly every other house was designed for a
"tavern." It was expected much would be realized from the sale of lots, etc., the desire for money-making and speculation
being ` about the same as that created by the new railroads of the present day.</P>

<P>In 1834 this little town was visited by the cholera, which made sad havoc, nearly or quite depopulating the place. Among
its victims were Daniel Warner, who was then keeping store; O. R. Baldwin, also a merchant; Dr. Buell, Mr. Smith, and
others. The towns along this road, on account of the great travel by all classes, nations, and conditions of people, were more
liable to be visited by contagious diseases than those away from the line of the road. Etna received another terrible
visitation in 1845, at this time from the small-pox, the treatment of which, at that time, was not as well understood as at the
present day. Much suffering and a number of deaths resulted. It was much to the credit of Jacob Shaff and Henry Warner
that they exerted themselves with considerable success in relieving this suffering.</P>

<P>The coming of the railroad stopped the growth of Etna and all other towns along the National road. It now has something
less than three hundred inhabitants.</P>

<P>Wagram, first called Cumberland, was laid out by Jerry Armstrong about the same time Etna came into existence, or a little
before. He tried hard to make something out of it by leading roads from many directions into it, but failed. A few dwellings,
a store and post office, were about the sum of what was accomplished toward building a town.</P>

<P>A respectful deference has always been paid to the subject of religion; harmony and good will always existing between the
different denominations, and reasonable support given to each. In fact, the township, for its size, is better supplied with
churches than most others in the county'</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 415</STRONG></P>

<P>there being five at present within its limits, viz.: Methodist Episcopal, United Brethren, Disciple, Reformed, and Albright.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Methodists were the earliest to hold services in this township, as in most other townships in the county. It is believed
that the first religious services in the township were held by this denomination in the cabin of Mr. Jacob Conine, about
1819 or 1820. A society was organized here, which continued its meetings, mostly in Mr. Conine's cabin, until Etna was
laid out in 1832, when the meeting place was transferred to the schoolhouse in that place. Mr. Conine's cabin stood near to
and on the south side of the South fork of Licking, and in the northern part of the township.</P>

<P>Among the first members of this organization were Thomas Donahue, Esquire Swain, Jacob Conine, wife and daughter,
Sarah Herron, and a few others. From this small beginning sprang the present Methodist church of Etna village. The old
frame church in the village, in which meeting were held more than thirty-five years, was erected about 1835, or not long, at
least, after the town was laid out. The present church, a fine brick edifice, was erected in 1871, and cost about seven
thousand five hundred dollars. At present the membership of this church is about thirty-five. Mr. Jacob F. Conine thus
writes regarding this church. He probably refers to the first organization in the town of Etna.</P>

<P>"The Methodist Episcopal church must have had a society formed here as early as 1830. I find minutes of a first
organization in July 13, 1836, when Thomas Donahue, Jonathan Gmble, and Edward Brown, a majority of the old board
present, and Uriah Heath, jr., preacher, bang present by appoint-merit of the preacher in charge. At this meeting John D.
Shank, David Anderson, Lyman Terrel, Amos Hart, and Edwin Adams, were nominated and approved trustees of the
Methodist Episcopal meeting house lot; and Dr. David Anderson was appointed as secretary to the board, or recording
trustee. At the same meeting Thomas Donahue, Lyman Terrel, and Amos Hart were appointed a building committee. On
the eleventh of July following, at a meeting of the trustees it was moved and seconded, 'That any two of the trustees of this
meeting-house shall have power to grant the liberty of the house to any minister of the gospel, of good and regular standing
in his own church, who holds to the divinity of Jesus Christ and the direct influence of the Holy Spirit, and only to the
commonly received Bible as the revelation of God, and who believes in future rewards and punishments, at such time as
there is no Methodist appointment.' Lyman Terrel was the author of this resolution, and it was carried by a unanimous
vote."</P>

<P>The first Sabbath-school in Etna was a union school, organized in Etna village. Children of all denominations attended it,
but, about 1841, the Methodists organized a school of their own, which has been continued ever since. <EM>This school </EM>is active
and vigorous at present, with a membership of fifty or more.</P>

<P>Although there is no Presbyterian church in this township, Presbyterianism had a start here soon after Etna was laid out.
Rev. Timothy W. Howe, who was for many years a resident of this township, in his paper upon the Presbyterian churches
in this part of the county, thus writes of early Presbyterianism in this township:</P>

<P>"Rev. C. Putnam, of jersey, preached in Carthage (Etna), November 18, 1832, in a hewed log house a few rods north of the
village. This was unquestionably the first sermon by a Presbyterian to Etna. Rev. Jacob Tuttle came from New Jersey in
1832, and commenced preaching in Lima, Harrison and Etna in the spring of 1833, and continued to do so more or less
regularly until the spring of 1837. He was highly esteemed, and his memory is cherished by his neighbors and friends.</P>

<P>"From Mr. Putnam's diary, I learn that March 10, 1833, he preached at Lima in the morning and at Etna in the evening.
Again, September m, 1834, Mr. Putnam attended the funeral of Messrs. Daniel Warner and Oliver K. Baldwin, in Etna, of
the firm of Warner, Baldwin &amp; Co., who died the day previous within twelve hours of each other, and were buned at the
same lime.</P>

<P>"Another note, under date of January 26, 1835, says: 'Funeral at Etna of Freeman Howe; aged twenty-four; sick nine days;
friends all in New Hampshire. His made the twenty-seventh grave in a yard where there were only three graves before the
burial of Messrs. Warner and Baldwin, in September previous.' That was the year iii which the cholera swept off so many
in Etna.</P>

<P>"October 14, 1838, Rev. T. W. Howe commenced his labors in the South Fork church. No house of worship was owned by
the Presbyterians at that time; only one family connected with the Presbyterian church at that time lived in a frame dwelling
house; the others lived in cabins. The meetings were held the first year in the Methodist Episcopal church in Etna, in the
frame school-house at the northwest corner of Kirkersville, and at the log school-house near Mr. S. D. Alward's. After the
first year in Etna, Presbyterians used the house built by the United Brethren, because the Presbyterians assisted them in
building it. For eleven years it was thus occupied every other Sabbath in the afternoon. .</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The Presbyterians and United Brethren in Christ, in 1842, formed a union Sabbath-school in Etna. The first year that
school averaged seventy-five pupils . the year round. The school continued in a very prosperous state for nine years, while
the Presbyterians preached in the United Brethren church. This school is still sustained."</P>

<P>Presbyterians, however, did not get a sufficient hold in Etna to enable them to. erect a church or continue their organization
within its limits. Gen-</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>416 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>erally, the few Presbyterians followed Mr. Howe over to the South. Fork church. Mr. Howe is still living in Pataskala,
having retired from ministerial labor. He is much respected by the community.</P>

<P>The United Brethren church, of which Mr. Howe speaks, is located in Etna. It is a frame building and was erected in 1838,
by the united efforts of the United Brethren and Presbyterians. The latter, however, owned no share in it, but had the use of
it by contract when not in use by the United Brethren. Rev. David Edwards was probably the first minister to preach in this
church for the United Brethren, and Samuel Hively, Daniel Snyder, and James and Ebenezer Drake and their mother, Mrs.
Drake, were among the first members of this church.</P>

<P>The Sunday-school in this church, as mentioned by Mr. Howe, was organized in 1842, and still continues in a prosperous
condition.</P>

<P>The Reformed church of Etna is located on what is known as the "Basil road," in the southern part of the township, about
three miles southwest of Kirkersville, and the same distance southeast of Etna village.</P>

<P>Prior to 1834, the few members of this denomination, mostly Germans, held meetings in their houses, but sometime during
that year, the Rev. David Wise came into .the neighborhood, and, assisted by Jacob Reef, Jacob Shearer, David Keller and a
few others, organized a church. Jacob Reef and Jacob Shearer were the first elders. In the fall of this year the society
erected a log church upon the site of the present building, and the dedicatory sermon was preached by Mr. Wise, who
continued as pastor of this church until 1854. The old church was taken away end the present comfortable building erected
in 1869. The present membership of this society is about seventy. The Sunday-school was organized in 1840, and i yet
sustained, with a membership of forty-five.</P>

<P>Near the above church is located the Albright or "The Emanuel Church of the Evangelic Order.' This church was organized
in 1875, by Rev. S  E. Rife, in a school-house on the same road upon which the church building stands. The following are
among the original members of this organization: John Hoffer and wife, John N. Born and wife, Samuel Ammon and wife,
Miss Susan Ammon and Miss Pauline Ammon, Jacob Scheidger and wife, Father Switzer, Mrs. Phipps and two daughters,
and a few others. Prior to the erection of the church, meetings were held in the Rees school-house every four weeks. The
present excellent church edifice was erected during the summer and fall of 1875, at a cost of two thousand dollars; and was
dedicated by Bishop Yost, November 21, 1875. Rev. Rife continued to hold services until the spring of 1877, when he was
succeeded by Rev. Mr. Hankey, who, in turn, was succeeded, in 1879, by the present pastor, Rev. Mohn. The present
membership of this church is about fifty-four. The Sunday-school was organized in the spring of 1876, with about seventy
pupils. It has been continued since, and now averages about seventy members. Jacob Smoke is superintendent.</P>

<P>The Campbellite or Disciple church is located on what is called York street, two-and-a-half miles east of Kirkersville, near
the northern line of the township, on the South fork. In May, 1853, the congregation was organized by William Hayes and
John C. Winter; it consisted of sixteen members, who met every Sabbath in the "Pine schoolhouse," on York street. The
members of this organization were Jacob and Eliza Winter, Abraham and Jane Morrow, Jacob and Isabella Stoolfire, Noah
and Mary Morrow, Nathan and Mary McVay, John and Eliza Crow, Daniel Stoolfire, Catharine McVay, Elizabeth Hoyt
and Hannah Crow. The officers chosen for this organization were Jacob Winter and Abraham Morrow, elders; Jacob
Stoolfire and Noah Morrow, deacons, and, April 15, 1854, Nathan McVay, Jacob Stoolfire and David Stoolfire, trustees.
The present church edifice was erected in the spring of 1855, and in September of the same year the building was dedicated
by Alexander Campbell.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The first preaching in this vicinity by a Disciple ' was by the Rev. A. E. Myers, a graduate of Betheny college, Virginia, in
August, 1852. The present membership of this church is about sixty-five. The society supports an active Sunday-school,
with a membership, at present, of fifty-five. </P>

<P>THIS township is situated in the northeastern part of the county, and is composed, principally, of rough, hilly, almost
mountainous land, which is less productive perhaps than any other in the county, not excepting even the lands of Eden. It is
very well adapted to pasturage and grazing, and there are a few narrow valleys where the soil is deep and rich; but it is an
exceedingly rough township, comparatively little first-class farming land within its limits, and much of it cannot be
cultivated at all, being covered with immovable rocks. The different varieties of oak have always been the prevailing
timber. It is watered by the Wakatomika and its tributaries in its northern and eastern part, and Painter's run, a tributary of
the Rocky fork, in its western part. The Wakatomika, which empties into the Muskingum at Dresden, is the principal
stream, and affords some water power, which has been used to a limited extent, several mill privileges having been
improved upon it within the limits of Fallsbury.</P>

<P>The region of the Wakatomika rivals that of the Rocky fork in the picturesqueness and beauty of its scenery, wildness and
rugged, mountainous aspect of its general surface. .The traveler along the narrow, winding road that skirts the stream will
be filled with wonder and admiration at the great upheaval that has apparently taken place in this region. All along the
stream the hills are elevated almost to the. altitude of mountains, and immense rocks lie piled in every conceivable
direction upon their surfaces, and protrude in every conceivable manner from their sides. At a point not far from Grigg's
mill is a place of especial interest called "Rent Rocks." It would seem as if an immense rock had been thrown down with
such force as to break it in several pieces. These pieces are lying at various distances from each other; some of them far
enough apart to admit the passage of a pedestrian or even an equestrian. They are of immense size, and from their
appearance and position have evidently, at some period of time formed one solid rock. There are many other places of
especial interest along this stream.</P>

<P>In its primitive condition this was an excellent locality for the hunter and trapper, and game continued to be plenty here
after it had disappeared from the valleys, where 'the settlements first occurred. Fallsbury retained its primitive appearance
longer than most other parts of the county, and, in fact, in many parts yet has the appearance of a new country; being in
places heavily timbered, and having many log cabins yet within its limits used as dwellings.</P>

<P>Few, if any, traces of the Mound Builders remain in this township; and it is probable that few of their works were erected
here.</P>

<P>No special Indian history has been preserved, though the first settlers found them occupying this territory. Mr. John Evans,
whose father brought him to the Wakatomika, a few miles below the Fallsburgh line in 1808, remembers that for several
years his playmates were Shawanee Indian boys. There was an encampment of these Indians on Shawanee run,. which
empties into the Licking, and no doubt they used all the country around, including this township, for their hunting ground.</P>

<P>David Bright was the first settler, building his cabin, in 1818, in the woods upon land since owned by Mrs. Botts. It was
among the last settled sections of the county, from the fact of its</P>

<P><HR>
</P>


<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>418 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>being away from the regular routes of travel and the undesirable quality of the land. The settlers that immediately
succeeded Bright were Hezekiah Blount, William Wilson, Paul, William and James Van Winkle. Settlers continued to
come in rapidly after the first settlement. The census of 185o shows a population of over twelve hundred; since that,
however, it has steadily declined for some reason. Probably but little more than half of this population remains. Most of
these settlers were from Virginia.</P>

<P>The township was organized in 1826, and the first election was held at the house of Samuel Varner. William Wilson was
elected justice of the peace, and continued to hold the office fifteen years. Joseph Frost was the second, and William V.
Hall the third. Minor McQueen, Levi Baughman, Lofland Hall, Dawson McQueen, James Colville, John Frampton,
William Hall and others were later magistrates of this township.</P>

<P>The first trustees were Samuel Varner, William Wilson and Joseph Frost; first constable, William Hall; first clerk, Samuel
Varner. John Evans was the second constable.</P>

<P>The township has no very extensively traveled thoroughfare, no turnpike, canal, telegraph or railroad, and nothing to attract
emigrants, but in educational, moral and religious matters, it is fully up to the average.</P>

<P>Noah Reed, Silas Bland, Moses Priest and Minor McQueen are now remembered as among the most prominent and active
politicians of the earlier days of Fallsburgh. Mr. Reed was elected to the legislature in 1849.</P>

<P>Silas Bland was a son of the Mr. Bland who removed from Pendleton county, Virginia, to the .mouth of Licking in 1798,
and who, with Hughes and Ratliff, pursued and shot the Indians who had stolen their horses. Silas was born in the sugar
camp, and rocked in a sugar trough. He subsequently removed to Perry township.</P>

<P>Fallsbury is a small post-town, situated near the center of the township. It was laid out on lands belonging to Silas Bland.
This land was first settled by Thomas Meeks and one or two of the McQueens. Minor McQueen was from Virginia, and
purchased about two hundred acre of land in the vicinity of the present village Fallsbury was never laid out; it grew, or
seemed to grow naturally, like a mushroom. No especial reason can be given why the town should exist at all, or should
have made a start in its present location, except, perhaps, that a few unimportant roads seemed to converge rather
irregularly in that vicinity, and it was about the center of a settlement. John Arnold built the first house; he was a farmer.
The second house was built by Jesse Riley. These were both log dwellings, and the latter is yet standing. They were built
about 1835 or 1840. Thomas Meeks erected the first blacksmith shop, soon after these cabins were built. George came a
little later and started a saloon and grocery, the first mercantile business in the town. He erected a small frame building for
a store room, afterward used as a shoe shop. The place never supported more than one store at a time until within the last,
ten years, when there have been taco the greater portion of the time.</P>

<P>Messrs. Robinson, Shake, and Christopher Johnson are now the store keepers. C: Hull now keeps a wagon shop, and there
are two blacksmith shops and a few other small establishments of various kinds. Messrs. Thomas Holmes &amp; Sons conduct
a general workshop, where articles of various kinds requiring mechanical skill are manufactured. They are also the owners
of a steam engine, which furnishes the power for a planing-mill, saw-mill and grist-mill, the latter grinding only corn,
however. Their business was started about 1869. There are three doctors; about 'twenty dwellings, and perhaps one hundred
people in the place. The village has rather a dilapidated, tumble-down look, as if it was not overwhelmed with thrift, and
the fact that it is built on very rough ground does not add to its appearance.</P>

<P>Doctor Gilbert was probably the first postmaster here, and was followed by a Mr. Balcom, who in turn was succeeded by
Mr. T. Fisk. J. W. Tilton was the next and Mr. Hickumbottom held the office prior to the appointment of the present
postmaster, L. H. Robison.,</P>

<P>Probably the first of the many mills erected on the Wakatomika in this township was by Hezekiah Blount, in what is now
known as "Egypt". This mill has changed owners frequently and been rebuilt, but is yet in operation and owned by Mr.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 419</STRONG></P>

<P>Garrison Frampton, and is known far and near as "Frampton's Mill." A saw-mill has been connected with it since.it was
first erected, which was fifty-five or sixty years ago.</P>

<P>The second mill on this stream, known as "Gregg's mill," and owned by William Gregg, was built about 184o, by Henry
Crabbs and William Garner. Only a sawmill was erected here at first, but a few years later the grist-mill was added. These
two with the Holmes' mill at Fallsbury, are probably the only mills in the township now in operation.</P>

<P>A very early school-house, and probably the first in the township, was erected in the Van Winkle. settlement, not far -from
the village of Fallsbury..</P>

<P>One of the first religious organizations in this township was, probably, the Old School Baptist. Miner McQueen was a
member of this denomination, and soon gathered around him a few settlers who were of his way of thinking, and they held
religious meetings in his house, himself preforming the duties of pastor. Mr. Christopher Coffman also preached
occasionally for these people.</P>

<P>The organization of the society was effected about 1832, and Miner McQueen, Christopher Coffman, John Fry and wife,
Mrs. Buck, Mrs. Varner, Mrs. John Porter and a few others were the original members of this organization. In the old
graveyard near Fallsbury yet stands an old, squatty, hewed-log building, the first, and, indeed, the only church erected by
this society. It was, probably, built about 1835. Services are yet regularly held in this building. The society is a weak one,
probably, not numbering over a dozen members at present.</P>

<P>During the war a great many new church organizations sprang up all over the country, in consequence of a difference of
political opinion, and the strife and feeling engendered by the great Rebellion. These organizations called themselves
"Christian Union," and the members were generally members of that portion of the Democratic party, who did not believe
in the prosecution of the war for the Union. They were generally members of other churches, who left those churches,
because the prayers for the President of the United States and the success of the Union army grated harshly upon their ears.</P>

<P>Such a church sprang up in Fallsbury. A Mr. George Higgins was the leader and principal organizer. This society was
organized at the schoolhouse, and the principal members, George Higgins, Gideon McQueen and wife, William Booth and
wife, Obediah Baufman, Thomas Gorley, Alice Gilbreath, John Reed, Henry Wilson, Lewis Baughman, Catharine
Mossholder, Susan Scott, Ann Scott, Levi Priest and wife, Alexander Smith and Leonard Billman.</P>

<P>This organization purchased a dwelling house, and fitted it up for -a church building, and George Higgins and Rev.
Atherton were the principal ministers. Soon after the war ended, the church ended, and has not, for some years, been known
among the churches of Fallsbury.</P>

<P>The third church organized in Fallsbury, was the Disciple. This congregation was organized the third Sunday in March,
1869, and during the same and the following year, erected a church building in the village. David D. Mitchel, Mr. White
and J. A. Walters were their first preachers; John Howell, elder; Samuel Hupp, clerk, and William Scott, John Howell and
Jacob Booth, trustees. The organization consisted of twenty-five members or snore; it now has a membership of forty-four.</P>

<P>The Sabbath-school was organized in 1875, the average attendance being now about twenty.</P>

<P>Outside the village of Fallsbury, there are two churches within the limits of the township-both Methodist Episcopal.</P>

<P>One, the Pleasant Valley church, is located on the Zanesville and Mount Vernon road, about one mile southeast of
Fallsbury. This church was organized at the house of Noah Reed, about 1836. Messrs. Noah Reed and George Gardner
were the principal movers in the organization; and the original members were Noah Reed and wife, George Gardner and
wife, Silas Bland and wife, John Tilton and wife, Aaron Decker, and William Beckham and wife.</P>

<P>Their first church building, a log, was erected about one mile south of the present building, in 1837 ; the second and present
building, a frame, was erected about 1857, and cost about one thou sand dollars. Their first 'regular minister was Rev. Bell,
of the Northern Ohio conference.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>At present this is a large active congregation, </P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>420 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>which has a membership of about one hundred..</P>

<P>The Sunday-school was organized the year after the church edifice was erected (1838), and has been well sustained, six
months in the year, to the present time, and now numbers forty or fifty members.</P>

<P>The other church in this township, also a Methodist Episcopal, was organized about the same time as the Pleasant Valley. It
is known as the "Goshen" church, and is located in what is known as Egypt, in the valley of the Wapitomika.</P>

<P>John Painter was one of the prominent members of this organization, and the society was probably first organized at his
house. Garrison Frampton was also a prominent mover in this organization and a class leader. John Rogers, John Frost and</P>

<P>Edward Bishop were also among the original members. Silas Bland who lived at that time in the neighborhood of Gregg's
mill, was also much interested in this church, and gave the ground upon which their first church building was erected. This
first building was a frame, and was built about 1855. Some years afterwards, this same building was moved several miles to
its present location in the eastern edge of the township, where it was repaired and built over into the present church, in
1880, costing as it stands about nine hundred dollars.</P>

<P>The present membership is probably fifty or more. The organization of the Sunday-school was coeval with that of the
church, and is yet maintained.</P>

<P>THIS township abounded in works erected by the Mound . Builders. Few sections of the extensive territory in which these
works are located are more prolific than this township. It seems to have been a Mound Builders' paradise. If these silent
monuments of a lost race could but talk, what treasures would they reveal. How insignificant man appears standing mute
and dumb beside these works; what a lesson they teach of man's ignorance, and how all his boasted knowledge and power
vanish, as in their presence he is dumb and helpless as a child. They are here, his practical sense tells him that, but little else
does he know of them.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Among the most elaborate and extensive of these works were those on the high hill, the most elevated ground in the
vicinity, a short distance north of Amsterdam, near to, and in a northeasterly direction from Fairmount church in Licking
township. These consisted of a circular wall or embankment, now only a few feet high, enclosing an area of about eight
acres. On the outside of this wall is a ditch eight or ten feet in width, which was made by throwing the earth out to make the
embarkment. These works have been plowed over many times, and are gradually disappearing. Within this enclosure there
stood, near its center, and within one hundred feet of each other, three mounds, two being of stone. One of the stone
mounds had a diameter at the base of forty-five feet, and the other two mounds of thirty feet; all were about twenty-five feet
in height. The two stone mounds were removed many years ago by</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 421</STRONG></P>

<P>Mr. John Cover, who found in the large one some skeletons within three feet of the surface of the ground, which must have
belonged to persons of very large size. The stone in these mounds were not of large size, and the earth, after. their removal,
was very black, and gave indications of the presence of fire before and soon after the commencement of the mounds;
perhaps upon the first layer of stone, or more likely, upon altars which had been erected, and upon which sacrifices had
been offered as an act of worship, as was the practice of some ancient nations.</P>

<P>By no means the most insignificant of the works of the Mound Builders in Franklin township, is the large stone mound half
a mile south of the center of the township. Its diameter at the base was originally about forty feet, but it is much more now,
as an attempt made many years ago to open it and get down into the middle, resulted in greatly reducing its height
(probably about twenty feet), and adding to its diameter by throwing the stone down upon all sides of it. The earth was not
reached in the middle, but the height of the mound was reduced about ten feet. The late Judge Elnathan Schofield, of
Lancaster, who was government surveyor during one of the earlier years of the present century, and as such run the section
lines here, one of which crossed this mound, made an entry upon his field notes, after designating its locality, pronouncing
it "a singular pile of stone."</P>

<P>He probably understood little at that early day about the works of the Mound Builders, particularly their stone works.</P>

<P>Probably the "Tippett" mound has attracted as much attention as any other in Franklin township. It is situated a few
hundred yards east of the road leading from Newark to Linnville, in full view of it, near the former residence of Mr. James
Tippett. This mound was seventy-five feet in diameter, and twenty-one feet high. It was opened several years since, and a
stone whistle and quite a number of human skeletons exhumed. Two remarkably well preserved crania were taken out, in
connection with skeletons, at twenty feet from the top, and just above the level of the land around the base of the mound.
The mound was composed of layers of earth, charcoal, ashes and human skeletons. This mound was opened with great care
by the Messrs. Tippett, and was one of the most symmetrical and interesting of its class.</P>

<P>There is a fort of low banks near the center of the township, in part on the farm of P. F. Coulter, nearly a mile. east of the
Tippett mound, and about the same distance northeasterly from the celebrated stone mound.</P>

<P>There is also a stone mound near the Madison township line, half a mile or more from Clay Lick; and also one on the farm
of A. Inlow, neither of which is of large size. There are also earth mounds of greater or less magnitude on the farms of H.
Trout, D. Moore, J. Smith, J. Brownfield, Mr. Handly's "spring farm," and also one near Hopewell township line east of
lands of Mr. A. Ballou, besides a few others not mentioned.</P>

<P>There is very little, if any, reliable Indian history in any way identified with the territory embraced within Franklin
township.</P>

<P>This township was composed entirely of United States military lands, sometimes called "Army lands," and was part of the
extensive tract dedicated by the Government to the payment of the officers and soldiers of the Revolution. Congress, by an
act passed June 1, 1796, authorized the survey into ranges and townships, of this tract, and Franklin township appears on
the plat of 'the original survey as in the first tier of townships in the eleventh range.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The surveys into ranges and townships took place soon after authority was granted by Congress, and it was to these
surveying parties that Elias Hughes, John Stadden, and perhaps others of the earliest pioneers of this county, were attached.
The surveys into smaller tracts than townships were made at subsequent, but not remote periods.</P>

<P>The township is watered by Hog run and Swamp run, the latter heading here, .and emptying into Hog run in Licking
township.; also by Little Clay lick, which heads in Hopewell township and flows through the corner of Franklin; and by Big
Clay lick, which has its source near the line of Hopewell, running about five miles through Franklin. The bottom lands
along these streams are very fertile, and the lands generally, though some what hilly, are productive, there being little if any</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>422 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>waste land in the township. Corn, the cereals, and grasses, all grow well.</P>

<P>The townships around Franklin were all settled before it, except Hopewell-Madison in 1798, Licking in 1801, Bowling
Green in 1802, and Newark, which corners with it, in 1800. The first settlers within the territory which now constitutes
Franklin township were George Ernst, John and Jacob Switzer, who came in the spring of 1805, the first-named from the
Shenandoah valley, and the two latter from the "Glades," in Pennsylvania. Mr. John Feasel came in the autumn of the same
year, also from the Shenandoah valley. John Siglar came to Licking township in 1805, from Maryland, and on the first day
of March, 1807, moved into this township. His son, William, then a mere lad, accompanied him. In 1808 Mr. John Hull
joined these pioneers, who were further reinforced in 1809 by Mr. Hugh Scott, Rev. J. W. Patterson, Isaiah Hoskinson, and
a Mr. Dustheimer. A Mr. Fulton came, meanwhile, who taught the first school in the township, in a building within the
circle of this first settlement.</P>

<P>Mrs. Motherspaw, daughter of the pioneer, John Feasel, had the longest residence in this township, having been brought
here in 1805 ; and Mr. William Siglar, the next longest, or since 1807.</P>

<P>Mr. John Wilkin, Michael Fry, as well as Uriah Hull and a few others, settled in this township in and before the year 1812,
when the township was organized and named, in honor of the great American philosopher, Benjamin Franklin, </P>

<P>Isaiah Hoskinson, sr., and Moses Sutton, sr., were elected the first justices of the peace.</P>

<P>Franklin township has not now, and never had, a village in it, except the minature town of Amsterdam. It has no stores, no
post offices, no grogshops, no manufactories. The people are almost wholly given to agriculture, and to the quiet, honest,
successful pursuit of their avocation, and have attained to a good degree of equality in pecuniary circumstances. The people
are sober, industrious, frugal, hospitable, and give no countenance or encouragement to vagabonds,  demagogues,
busy-bodies in other people's matters, to the idle, or lazy, to loafers, vagrants, horse-jockies or speculators, professional
office-seekers, note-shavers, whiskey-drinkers, nor, indeed, any who are engaged- in vicious and demoralizing pursuits. It
is literally and preeminently a rural township, in which the rural virtues prevail. During the seventy-five years that have
elapsed since the first settlement of the township, they have had only four county officers. The late Henry Burner was
county commissioner, Mr. Anthony Pitzer county surveyor, Stephen Hoskinson commissioner, and Benjamin Brownfield a
member of the legislature. The township has probably furnished as few representatives for the State prison as for the State
legislature. The National road runs along the southern boundary of Franklin, being mainly in Bowling Green, but in several
places running a little into Franklin, as at Amsterdam, and for some distance east of it. The Flint ridge slopes off nearly a
mile from Hopewell into Franklin, striking it near the middle of its eastern boundary, making that portion of the township,
to the extent of a mile in width, unusually hilly, or somewhat mountainous in its aspects and scenery. Little has ever been
done in the way of attempts to turn to practical account the mineral deposits of this township. One such effort was made
about fifty years ago by Mr. Hugh Scott, one of the early and enterprising pioneers of the township, who discovered, upon
his land, a deposit of iron ore, which he mined, and marketed by hauling it to the Granville furnace. It was understood
generally, to have been attended with rather ill success, but whether the enterprise terminated because of the distance
between the ore and the furnace, and consequent expense of getting it to market, or whether the deposit was worked out and
the supply ceased, or for other reasons is not remembered. If, therefore, the township has any mineral wealth, it is, as yet,
undeveloped.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Schools were early organized, and educational matters in the township have kept pace with those of other townships in the
county. It is divided into six school districts in which good-houses are erected. There is also one fractional district in the
southern part. </P>

<P>The first religious society started in the township was the Methodist society, which now worships in Ellis chapel. It was
organized at the house of John Siglar, in 1809, or a year later,</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 423</STRONG></P>

<P>possibly. The first church edifice they erected was a hewed log building in 1818, on the site of the present building, which
superseded it in 1851.</P>

<P>Among the early time ministers of the society were Ralph Lotspeitch, James Quinn, Jesse Stoneman, Levi Shinn, brother to
Asa, Isaac Quinn, David Young, Michael Ellis, Charles Waddle, Mr. McElroy, Noah Fidlar, Martin Fate, John McMahon,
C. Springer, Alexander McCracken, Leroy Swormsted, and Jacob Young.</P>

<P>The Lutherans organized the second church in Franklin township. This is the pioneer Lutheran church in Licking county,
and the Rev. Andrew Henkle, Rev. Peter Schmucker, Rev. Charles Henkle, and Rev. Amos Bartholomew, were the pioneer
Lutheran preachers. The first named organized the Lutheran church in this township, in the autumn of 1817, having
previously visited and preached to the people in that neighborhood a few times. The settlers were, for the most part, from
the Shenandoah valley, Virginia, and had been trained in the Lutheran faith and doctrines.</P>

<P>George Ernst, Daniel Motherspaw, John Feasel, Henry Burner, Jacob Wilkins, Jacob Row, the family of John Wilkin
deceased, and a few others, with the families of the foregoing, patronized the enterprise of Mr. Henkle, and soon after the
organization: of the society they erected a hewed-log structure of small dimensions, which answered the double purpose of
church and school-house. Rev. Andrew Henkle's father, Rev. Paul Henkle, a well known Lutheran minister in the
Shenandoah valley, and the successor of the distinguished Rev. General Peter Muhlenberg, of revolutionary fame and
memory, had been the religious instructor of some of these families, and of their fathers and mothers. They, therefore,
readily and joyfully embraced the opportunity presented of having the Gospel preached to them statedly, by a minister of
their own faith, and that, too, by the son of the pastor of their parents. Sometime previous Rev. Andrew Henkle had taken
charge of the Lutheran church in Somerset, Perry county, and while living there, he, in 1817, organized this church in
Franklin, and immediately thereafter was elected pastor, and remained such until 1824, when he resigned.</P>

<P>After his resignation the church remained without a settled minister r about two years, but its pulpit was supplied with
considerable regularity by Rev. Peter Schmucker, of Newark, then engaged in secular pursuits, but who answered the calls
for ministerial services on the Sabbath; and by Rev. Charles Henkle, of Somerset, a brother of Andrew, who bad, at that
time, charge of some churches in Perry county.</P>

<P>The Shenandoah valley was very prolific in Lutherans and Lutheran ministers. Rev. Peter Muhlenberg was, until 1776, the
principal Lutheran minister in that valley, and was, moreover, the son of the founder of the Lutheran church in the United
States. In 1776, soon after Lord Dunmore's treachery to the colony of Virginia became manifest, being then in charge of the
Lutheran church at Woodstock, he abandoned his pulpit and took the field as a regimental officer of the Virginia line.</P>

<P>Rev. Paul Henkle, father of Andrew and Charles, entered the Shenandoah valley before the close of the last century, and
preached there many years. He reached a great age, and continued his ministrations in the pulpit to near the close of his life.
He had a large family of sons, all of whom, probably, entered the Lutheran ministry in the  Shenandoah valley, except one.
Those now remembered were David, Paul, Andrew, Charles and Ambrose, making, with the father, six in all.</P>

<P>The father of Rev. Peter Schmucker emigrated to this country, and settled in the Shenandoah valley near the
commencement of the present century. Three of his sons, George, Nicholas and Peter, there entered the Lutheran ministry.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Nicholas ministered to the same congregation, and from the same pulpit, for a generation at least, which Rev. Peter
Mublenberg had left when he entered the army. The two brothers of Nicholas also preached in the different Lutheran
churches of the valley. Rev. S. S. Schmucker and hi s son, Rev. S. M. Schmucker, who were son and grandson of George;
and Rev. George Schmucker, son of Nicholas, also making six in all, had each charge of Lutheran churches in the valley,
which, in the aggregate, ran through a period of many years.</P>

<P>Ministrations from these Shenandoah valley preachers to these Shenandoah valley Christian emigrants of Franklin
township, often brought</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>424 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>vivid impressions of old-time religious services to their minds, and could not well have been otherwise than mutually
interesting. Their voices and the voices of those bearing their names, had been heard by these people long before, and here
they felt that they were not strangers. '</P>

<P>In the fall of 1826, Rev. Amos Bartholomew was called to the church as its pastor, and remained about eleven years. After
remaining vacant about a year, Rev. J. Manning became regular pastor, in which capacity he served the church nearly eight
years; meanwhile the church edifice, commenced during the pastorate of Mr. Bartholomew, was completed, and has since
been occupied. It is neat and commodious. After remaining vacant two years, Rev. Mr. Richart became pastor, and
remained two years. He was succeeded in a short time by Rev. G. W. Shafer, who continued the settled minister several
years. After the resignation of Mr. Shafer, the pulpit was supplied about one year by Rev. D. F. Phillips, and then by Rev.
William M. Gilbreath for two years. The latter was succeeded by his brother, Rev. J. L. Gilbreath, in 1854.</P>

<P>The church enjoys a moderate degree of prosperity. It sustains a prayer meeting, and has connected with it a flourishing
Sabbath-school.</P>

<P>The first elders of this church were Daniel Motherspaw and George Ernst.</P>

<P>The third, last formed, and only other religious society in this township, is the Christian Union church, organized during the
progress of the late Rebellion. It was composed, principally, of those Methodists who held their membership at Ellis chapel,
in Franklin, and at Spencer chapel, in Hopewell townships, who did not approve of the attitude of the Methodist Episcopal
church on slavery, the war, and collateral questions, or who disapproved of the introduction of those secular matters into
the pulpit.</P>

<P>Some of those who actively participated in the establishment of this church, were William Henslee, William Rutledge, John
Cochran, Daniel Loughman, Zachariah Rutledge, David Wolf, John Wolf, John Snelling, Samuel Lampton, and William D.
Rutledge..</P>

<P>They erected a neat, substantial church near the township line between Franklin and Hopewell. A Sabbath school is
connected with the church. Revs. Benjamin Green and W. Henslee for some years after the organization of the church
occupied its pulpit.</P>

<P>In this connection it will be interesting to religious people in the township to know what Mr. Isaac Smucker says in his
"Recollections of 1825," regarding the first camp meeting he ever attended, and which was in this township:</P>

<P>"A few days after my arrival here, in 1825, I attended a camp meeting held in Franklin township, not far from the large
stone mound, some eight miles from Newark. The meeting was held in a pleasant and somewhat romantic locality, near the
western termination of the Flint ridge. The weather was delightful, the preaching good, and the surrounding and incidents
of the meeting had a flavor of freshness and novelty about them that rendered the occasion one decidedly enjoyable.</P>

<P>"A tall, slender, erect, long-visaged, grave old man, with elongated hair, that had passed into the last stage of silver-grey
hue, occupied himself conspicuously as chief singer of the occasion-the venerable leader in the musical department of the
devotional exercises. His name was Siglar, I understood, and he sung with spirit, energy and much power of voice. The
great congregation joined him and they made the welkin ring sonorously while singing those fine old Methodist camp
meeting hymns. The multitude gathered for worship from all the regions round about in these ancient groves, were greatly
moved, yea! thrilled by the inspiring notes of the melodious minstrelsy. The reverberations of those sacred songs, as sung
by a thousand voices in the spirited, natural, unartistic style of our primitive settlers, in those grand old woods, gave zest to
the enjoyment of the interesting occasion, and the scenes and incidents thereof are numbered among  the memories to be
cherished in the hereafter.</P>

<P>" Rev. Zerah H. Coston was the only preacher present whose ' name I now remember. I had heard him preach a sermon a
short time before, in front of the old jail, for the benefit of Peter Dimond, then under sentence of death. I think, however,
that judge Fidlar, whom I heard perform a similar 'service for Dimond, was also present, though I am not certain. This was
my first appearance at a Methodist camp meeting, but not my last. 1 attended one held near Chatham, nearly fifty years ago,
where I heard Rev. L. L. Hamlin preach his celebrated sermon from the text "Ye are my witnesses saith the I lord ! ' I had
heard him preach it once before, and it was worth repeating. Few men had a more attractive style of pulpit oratory than he. I
also attended one on the Flint ridge, more than forty-five years ago, conducted by our well known pioneer veteran, the Rev.
C. Springer, and another a few years later, held near Elizabethtown, under the same management.</P>

<P>I have attended others later, and I confess to a partiality by way of variety, for the old style of camp meeting oratory-the
pulpit in the wilderness, as we had it in the days of " Auld lang  syne."</P>

<P>THIS township is second in the county in population, wealth and influence. It was fortunate in being peopled from the start
with first-class settlers-people of intelligence, thrift and energy. I They were from New England and a province in Old
England-Wales. The former were shrewd, pushing, enterprising, money-making; and both were honest, industrious,
religious. Both came in oganized communities, determined to establish permanent, prosperous and happy homes in the far
west. The combination of the various elements of which these communities . were composed, was a most fortunate one,
and probably a more desirable population could not be found in the State or United States than they furnished to Granville
township. With this foundation to build upon, is it any wonder the superstructure is sold, beautiful, attractive, and destined
to have a history of continually increasing importance, and an influence for good that will extend its boundary- continually
as the years go by?</P>

<P>The township was organized in 1807, out of the west half of Licking township, Fairfield county. The .latter township then
embraced all of what is now Licking county, except the Refugee lands. This being cut in two in the center, the west half
was named Granville, and was, therefore, the. second township organized in this territory.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The soil of the northern half is not especially attractive, being composed of hills or table lands and is clayey, but produces
wheat and all the small grains in abundance. It was .all heavily timbered with the different varieties of oak and other hard
woods that flourish on the uplands. This part of the township seems to have been very attractive to the Welsh people, by
whom it was mainly settled, probably from the fact that it was, at an early day, far more healthy than the miasmatic bottoms
of Raccoon and Licking. Since the county has been cleared, cultivated and settled, these bottoms are as healthy as the
"Welsh Hills," and far more productive. There is, however, a good deal of rich bottom land in the township along the
Raccoon fork and its tributaries. The peculiar blending of hill and valley in this beautiful region attracted the</P>

<P>New England pioneers, who also dreaded the ague and malaria of the broader and more swampy bottoms of Licking, and
yet desired bottom land for farming purposes. There is a gentle terraced in cline down the Raccoon from Granville to
Newark. This stream of clear, beautiful water passes across the township a little south of its center, tumbling over a rocky
and gravelly bed, and is the only stream of consequence within the township limits. </P>

<P>An Indian trail branched from the main trail near Newark, and passed across the township up the Raccoon valley to the
Wyandot village near Johnstown.. Unfortunately no Indian history has been preserved in connection with this township and
this is the case, also, with most other town-</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>426 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>ships in the county-though there is no doubt that this territory, especially the valley of the Raccoon, was extensively used by
them as a hunting ground. No permanent Indian camps appear to have had an existence here, unless prior to historic times.</P>

<P>The works of the Mound Builders in this township are very numerous and interesting; indeed, in number and varied
character are scarcely excelled by those of Newark township. The Raccoon valley and contiguous territory constitute,
probably, the most interesting territory in the State, or even in the United States for the antiquarian. Mounds of different
sizes and heights, earthworks of every kind known to the historian exist here in great numbers. Numbers yet to be seen and
traced may almost be counted by the hundred, while many, very many, have disappeared entirely, by the ravages of time
and the plow, and live only in the memory of the oldest inhabitants. No particular care seems to be taken to preserve these
mounds and works. Wherever they are in the way of the tiller of the soil, they are ruthlessly plowed down or dug away.
They are disappearing with comparative rapidity, and very soon, with few exceptions, will live only in history.
Occcasionally they are erected upon high peaks, or places inaccessible to the plow and cultivator, and in such places are, of
course, in the best state of preservation. The traveler between Newark and Granville will observe many of these mounds, a
few yet pretty well preserved, even on the extensive and rich bottoms of the Raccoon; but the better preserved works, and
those probably the most interesting, are located upon the hills that shut in the valley. Captain M. M. Munson, who occupies
a beautiful farm in the midst of these mounds, and who has made them something of a study, is confident that around the
great Alligator mound, located not far from his house, is a complete system of mounds and earthworks that point to it as a
common center. How-ver this may be, there is certainly a large circle of works in this vicinity, extending several miles in
every direction, and seemingly connected with each other and with the "Old Fort" near Newark and its contiguous works.</P>

<P>The Alligator mound is situated upon the summit of a hill nearly two hundred feet high, about six miles west of Newark,
near Granville. The shape and form of this reptilian monster are distinctly presented, so that all admit, at the first glance,
that it was undoubtedly intended to represent the alligator or American crocodile. His entire length is two hundred feet. The
greatest breadth of his body is twenty feet, and his length between the fore legs and hind legs is fifty feet. The limbs are
each twenty-five feet long. The head, fore shoulders and back have an elevation varying from three to six feet, while the
remainder of the body averages considerably less. The head, limbs and tail gradually taper off to their termination. The
scholarly author of "Pre-Historic Man" visited this effigy in 1876, .just before the issue of the third edition of his work, and.
he expresses the belief that it "symbolizes some object of special awe and veneration, thus reared on .one of the chief `high
places' of the nation, with its accompanying altar, upon which these ancient people could witness the celebration of the rites
of their worship, its site having been obviously selected as the most prominent feature in a populous district abounding in
military, civic and religious structures." It is probable this effigy was an object of worship, as the Mound Builders were
certainly a superstitious and idolatrous race. It probably belongs to the same class of mounds as the "Eagle mound" in the
"old fort." The hill upon which the Alligator mound is situated, is a "spur" jutting into the level bottom, and not far from
the foot of the hill, and to the east of it perhaps one-fourth of a mile, on the level bottom, is the curiously shaped mound
called the "Crescent." It is an "immense pile of dirt," which seems to lie upon top of the ground as if it had been transported
from a distance, thrown down there and fashioned into the shape of a half-moon or crescent. It is composed largely of
gravel and in its composition differs largely from the dark, loamy earth around it. This mysterious crescent-shaped pile has
been plowed over for fifty years or more, and of course is much reduced in height, but is yet probably six or seven feet
high. It is large and thick in the center, and tapers in either direction to a point. It is located on lot number eight of the
Granville purchase, now owned by D. M. Knapp.</P>

<P>Another very extensive earthwork once occupied</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 427</STRONG></P>

<P>the bottom land near the Crescent, and to the south of it. When the first settlers entered this valley, and. for several years
afterward, this immense circular wall was plainly visible and was two or three feet in height in places. It enclosed seventy-five or eighty acres of beautiful bottom land, and, like the Crescent, the embankment seemed to have been made without
digging the earth from either side of it, no ditch appearing. This work covered portions of lots seven, eight, nine and ten of
the Granville purchase, and the larger part of it was between Centerville street and the bluffs on the north of the valley,
though it extended, probably, slightly south of Centerville street. The "savage plowshare" has long since done its work, and
this work of antiquity has probably entirely disappeared. It is said that the embankment was without a break or gateway,
and no mound or other work appeared within the circular enclosure.</P>

<P>North of this, half a mile or more, east of the Crescent about the same distance, and upon a "spur" of the bluffs, on the "Fort
Hill" or McCune farm is one of the most wonderful of all the ancient works in this section-wonderful from its size, peculiar
shape and internal arrangement. It is situated upon lots five and six of the Granville purchase, extends a little into the
Welsh Hills purchase, and was evidently intended, from its outside ditch and high embankment, as a military work. Even to
this day the embankment is in places, measuring from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the embankment, ten feet in
height, though generally it is much lower than this; but when first erected it must have been a work of considerable
magnitude. It incloses about fifty acres of ground. The embankment, evidently a breast-work, is a perfect piece of
engineering skill, following closely the sinuosities of the brow of the hill, and wherever there is a ditch or depression in the
hill, the embankment is higher than in other places. Conforming as it- does to the form of the surface of the hill it is
irregular in shape.</P>

<P>Upon the hill, inside of this inclosure, two small circular works appear, inclosing about half an acre each. These have been
plowed over many years and are much worn away, though the walls are probably yet three or four feet in height. These
smaller works are in the form of circles, without any break in the walls, and are both located upon the highest part of the
hill, and near to its southern extremity, or, at least, a little south of the center of the greater work. They are very near each
other and lie on an east and west line. From the manner in which some of the forts of to-day are built, it would seem that
these two smaller works were erected as places of last resort, or, in other words, as works in which to rally and fight after
being driven from the outer defenses.</P>

<P>In the most easterly of these two circular forts, are two small mounds, or lookout-stations, also an east and west line very
near each other, and now not over two or three feet high. The whole surface of the hill is under cultivation, and this great
work of antiquity is slowly disappearing in consequence.</P>

<P>Still further to the east of this work, and upon the bluffs, is situated what is known as the "reservoir," evidently once an
artificial lake or reservoir for water. It is situated on lots two and three of the Granville purchase, now owned by M. M.
Munson , and is probably twenty rods across the top. It is probably half a mile from the fort above mentioned, is located in
a natural depression in the hills, and has evidently been scooped out with great labor. Near this, and a little east of north, on
lot two, is a "sugar loaf" or conical mound of considerable size-probably fifteen feet in height and forty or fifty feet in
diameter at the base. This mound is in a good state of preservation.</P>

<P>Still traveling eastward upon the bluffs, two conical hills are reached in half a mile or more, upon which are two small
mounds, apparently scraped up to increase the height of these points as lookout stations. One is located upon the eastern
and the other upon the western line of the farm of L. E. Bancroft, and not far from the eastern line of the township.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Coming down into the valley several beautiful mounds are found further east in Newark township. </P>

<P>On the southern end of lot eight, of the Granville purchase,. belonging to Messrs. T. M. and T. Rose, very near and just
south of Centerville street is a curious heap of sand, for which it is hard to account, unless it be that the Mound Builders
placed it there. It is in the center of a fine alluvial</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>428 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>bottom, and is irregular in form, appearing to have been brought from a distance and thrown off there for some purpose,
although where it could have been brought from is something of a mystery, as the creek bottom in the vicinity does not
appear prolific in the kind of sand of which it is composed. Immediately south of this sand pile and a few rods from it, yet
exists the walls of a large  circular work, enclosing, probably, twenty-five acres. The whole of this land has been under
cultivation since the first settlement of the country, and the embankment is nearly plowed away in places, though still
visible, and generally two or three feet above the surface of the ground. This appears to have been a perfect circle, without
ditch on either side, and without any opening or gateway. Its location is near where the old Granville feeder joins the
Raccoon. It is very close to, and evidently connected with, the very large circular work before mentioned as covering
seventy-five or eighty acres, and which has entirely disappeared. Directly south of this work, on the same lot, in the vicinity
of the spot where the old canal feeder joins the Raccoon, and very near where the old Munson forge stood, is, or rather was,
an ancient well. It was long since filled up, and now exists only in the memory of the older settlers. The probability is it was
filled in the construction of the canal, as it was very near the southern edge of the embankment. When first discovered it
was sixty or seventy feet in depth, and had evidently been bored through the soft shale that here underlies the surface. It
was three or four feet in diameter; no water appeared in if, and the supposition is, that the operators, whether Mound
Builders, Indians, or white men, had bored for salt, as a salt well was subsequently sunk in this vicinity, and operated for a
time with partial success. Further up the creek a few rods, on the lot of E. Haskell is a -conical mound, in a good state of
preservation, probably ten feet in height, and thirty or forty feet in diameter.</P>

<P>Directly south of these works in the valley, on the bluffs south of the creek, are many beautiful mounds. One of them on the
farm of H. J. Little is about the size of the above described mound, has not been mutilated, and is yet in a good state of
preservation. To the west of this on the bluffs, are several others similar in construction to those described, and the same
may be said of the country north and northwest of Granville. To locate and describe all these works would occupy more
space than can be allowed in this work. Suffice it to say they are very numerous, but not perhaps, different from those
already described. A conical mound once existed in Main street, in Granville, between the four churches of that place. It
was graded down to make way for the street. It was probably fifteen feet in height at the date of the first settlement.
Jeremiah R. Munson delivered a fourth of July oration from its summit in 1806.</P>

<P>Late in November, 1800, on the banks of Ramp creek, was lighted a camp-fire, around which sat four men who have played
no small part in the history of this county. These men were John Jones, Phineas Ford, Frederick Ford, and Benoni
Benjamin. Jones and the two Fords were married to the three sisters of Benjamin. Jones was of Welsh extraction, but was
born in New Jersey and partly reared in Pennsylvania; the Fords were originally Yankees, from Connecticut, and Benjamin
was born in Northampton county, Pennsylvania. His father, Jonathan Benjamin, who followed him to this county about two
years later, was born in the same decade with Washington, and was thirty-eight years old at the Declaration of
Independence. During the Revolution, in order to protect his family from Indians, he moved to the vicinity of Baltimore,
Maryland. At the close of the war he returned to Pennsylvania, where he remained until the spring of 1793, when he
removed to the Virginia side of the Ohio, nearly opposite Marietta. Here Jones and the Fords married his three daughters.</P>

<P>In the spring of 1799 these men, with their brother-in-law, Benoni Benjamin, went out to the Scioto, where they planted
and raised a crop, and returning in the fall, moved their families there. In November, 18oo, at the instance of Jones, they
traveled up the Scioto to where Circleville now stands, and from there followed an Indian trail through Fairfield county in
the direction of Licking.</P>

<P>Jones had before seen the Licking valley, having been connected with some surveying expedi-</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 429</STRONG></P>

<P>tions, as well as Indian raids in this direction. Few, if any of the many enchanting basins in the Mississippi valley presented
a more encouraging prospect to the pioneer than the Licking valley at that time, and it is not to be wondered at that Jones, a
man of keen perceptions, sharpened and developed by extensive travel and adventure, should have led his little party of
adventurers hither.</P>

<P>A little incident that occurred at the camp fire before mentioned, is worthy of record. .</P>

<P>Mr. Isaac Stadden who had arrived at the Bowling Green a short time previous, was out hunting, when he suddenly came
upon this camp of pioneers. Each party was agreeably surprised at the unexpected meeting. Stadden had supposed that
those living in the Licking valley were the only setlers in this section; while Jones and his party, entering the county from
the Scioto, supposed they were the advanced pioneers, and that there was no settlement nearer than the mouth of the
Licking on the Muskingum.</P>

<P>The hospitality common among the early settlers made Stadden a welcome visitor for the night. Jones and Stadden soon
recognized in each other old acquaintances, they having been school-fellows in Pennsylvania. Neither had seen the other
for a quarter of a century, and knew nothing of each other's intervening history, of their adventures or whereabouts. Of the
interest of such a meeting of such men, under such circumstances, none but pioneers can conceive.</P>

<P>There is a discrepancy in the statements regarding the time of this meeting, and also regarding the date of the arrival of
Jones and his party. Captain M. M. Munson, from whose paper a part of the history of this township is taken, says this
meeting took place in the spring of 1800, while Mrs. Stadden, wife of Isaac Stadden, says the meeting took place in the fall
of 1800, and that the wives of these gentlemen (the Fords and Benjamin), were not with them at the time, but that they were
prospecting in this valley with aview to settlement, and did settle here in the spring of 1801, as has been stated.</P>

<P>It is impossible at this late day to reconcile these conflicting statements, but a close study o all the circumstances and
incidents connected with the first settlement of the county, a comparison of dates and of matters connected with the early
settlers would seem to place the weight of evidence in favor of Mrs. Stadden's statement. Mrs. Stadden was a pioneer of
1800, was very careful in her statements regarding pioneer matters, and a woman of remarkable mind and memory.</P>

<P>Before coming here, Jones and his party had been offered what was termed donation lots by the agents of General Dayton, a
large land-holder in the territory now composing Licking county. These lots were supposed to be located on Ramp creek, a
stream which ran out in side-cuts or bayous, forming little swamps and ooze grounds, with "cat-tails and leeks." These, to
Jones, foreboded agues and biliary diseases, and he at once refused to make the stipulated settlement, and determined to
locate on Middle or Raccoon fork.</P>

<P>Jones led his party across the middle fork, searching out one of the many springs of living water that skirt the base of the
hills that enclose the valley. On lot number two. of the Granville purchase, some ten rods from the foot of the hill, and
some twenty rods from the present Centerville street, he made the first settlement within the present limits of Granville
township.</P>

<P>Some years before this, a hurricane had passed over this valley, taking down the primeval timber, and at the time of
settlement the country was timbered with a second growth, in many places the blue ash predominating This was particularly
the case at the base of the hills, made wet and loamy by the sinking of the waters of the numerous springs that burst from
the hill sides. Of these trees Jones built his cabin. By the last days of April, or the first of May, the logs had been cut, and
the men, assisted by their wives, raised the first white man's cabin in this township. Jones moved into this cabin, and the
entire party remained with him until cabins had been erected on each of the locations selected. The Fords built on Ramp
creek, near Union station, and Benjamin further down that stream, within the present limits of Newark township, not far
from where the stream passes under the Granville feeder.</P>

<P>Here begins the history of Granville township. Sometime in the same year, Patrick Cunningham, an Irishman (elsewhere
mentioned in the</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>430 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>history of Newark township), built the second cabin, and became the second settler of the township.</P>

<P>This house was about twenty or twenty-five rods northeast of the Jones' cabin, and near another spring. Cunningham
planted some trees, and began the cultivation of several kinds of plants and fruits. In a year or two he removed to, and
became one of the first settlers of, Newark.</P>

<P>In the spring of 1802, some young men built some shanties, or cabins, a few rods east of "Paddy" Cunningham's, and that
season raised a crop of corn.</P>

<P>It was in this year that the vanguard of Welsh Hills settlers made its appearance. Deacon Theophilus Rees had made a
purchase of land in this township during the previous year, and had sent Chaplain Jones and others out to view it. A
carefully written history of this settlement appears in another chapter.</P>

<P>David Thomas and David Lewis were the first of the Welsh Hills settlers to enter the township as permanent settlers; but
they were soon followed by Theophilus Rees and "Jimmy" Johnson.</P>

<P>Mr. Munson says that these Welsh settlers, the first of them, came in the fall, bought the crops the young men above
mentioned had raised, moved into the cabins they vacated, and remained during the winter, beginning their settlement on
the Welsh Hills in the spring of 1803.</P>

<P>The coming of Deacon Rees and his colony marks a most important era in the history of the township. He was a man of
more than ordinary cultivation, a devoted member of the church, and his decendants are among the most respected of this
community at the present time.</P>

<P>On the first of October, 1802, Mrs. Jones gave birth to the first white child born in the township, and on the twenty-second
day of the same month, Mrs. Jones died of puerperal fever, aged twenty-eight years. This was the first death of a white
person in this township. She was buried in Newark, on a little hill or hillock (probably an ancient mound,) just west of the
market-house, and where the Beckwith family resided. Jones, after the death of his wife, sold his house and improvements
to one Nash, and removed to the mouth of Fishing creek, below Wheeling, where he married a second time.</P>

<P>John Jones was born in New Jersey, but lived sometime in Pennsylvania, and, subsequently, on the banks of the Ohio river,
in the western part of Virginia. The Fords and Benjamin also lived there in 1793. Mr. Jones died in October, 1851, after
raising a family at the mouth of Fishing creek. </P>

<P>Nash was in possession and occupying the house at the coining of the Granville company in 1805. </P>

<P>There seems to be a desire to immortalize the first cabin erected in any particular subdivision of territory, and, as far as
possible, every other first thing that entered into the germ of the new settlements. At a pioneer meeting on New Years day,
1868, several canes made from the logs of this first cabin were presented to the officers of the Pioneer society, and the
following is an extract from the address of Captain Munson, made at the time:</P>

<P>"The trees from which these sticks were made were cut and builded into a house before either of you were born. The wood
was rolled up into the first white man's house reared in this township. In this house was born the first white child in the
township, and here was witnessed the first death struggle. The first sermon preached in the township resounded from its
walls; its manifold incidents would alone make a volume. " " These mountings are made from ancient coins plowed up
around the old house, and could they but reveal their history, we should be amazed and charmed at its witchery and
interest."</P>

<P>The canes were presented to Hon. Isaac Smucker, secretary, and Dr. J. N. Wilson, vice-president of the society.</P>

<P>In 1803, John Duke, James Evans, James James, and Mr. Chadwick settled in this township; Messrs. Evans and James
being Welshmen, settled on the Welsh hills. John Duke located near the Raccoon creek, and was elected the first justice of
the peace in 1807. Esquire Duke came in 1803, from the vicinity of Wellsburgh, Brooke county, Virginia. His son, S. A.
Duke, is now an influential citizen of Arkansas.</P>

<P>The settlers, in 1804, of this township were Thomas Cramer, Simon James, and Peter Cramer, who settled on the Welsh
hills. They were from western Virginia.</P>

<P>The third, and a great epoch in the history of this township is marked by the coming of the Granville colony, in the fall of
1805. About the beginning of the present century, many organizations were effected in the east for the purpose of
purchasing land and making settlements in the great Northwest Territory and the State of Ohio.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 431</STRONG></P>

<P>Among these organizations was the "Licking Land company." The origin of this company, like . many other great
enterprises in the world's history, it is said, had a love matter at the bottom of it. It is related that a young man offering
himself to a young woman, in a neighboring and somewhat rival township, was rejected, and on his way home made a
resolve to emigrate from a land where women were so fickle and false, to the new country beyond the Ohio. However this
may be, on the twenty-third day of April, 1804, in East Granville, Massachusetts, a meeting was held, at which articles of
association were drawn up and signed by thirty-five persons, mostly residents of the towns of Granville, Massachusetts, and
Granby, Connecticut. In the preamble, the objects of the association were stated to be the purchase of lands in the State of
Ohio; the sending of agents to Ohio to explore, to obtain correct information as to quality and situation of lands, price,
mode of payment, title, etc. The body of the article makes them a body corporate, with as large powers as could be attained
without special legislation, with two articles of reservation: The first forbids a levying of taxes by a vote of the company,
unless one-half of the subscribers or corporators should be present ; the second provides that the agreement shall not be
binding unless thirty persons shall subscribe to the same. Of the thirty-five persons subscribing to these articles, none
survive. Captain Levi Rose, who lived and died at his old home on North street, was the last survivor. By a subsequent vote
of the corporation, the price of membership, which had been eight dollars, was raised to ten dollars. May 10, 1804, the
company met and appointed Levi Butler, Timothy Rose and Job Case agents, to go to Ohio to view and purchase such lands
as would justify a settlement of the company.</P>

<P>On the first day of August, 1804, another meeting of the company was held, when forty-four more persons signed the
articles of association. Of these none survive. Amos Carpenter dying in Columbus, was, probably, the last.</P>

<P>The agents appointed to view the land came. to Ohio in May, 1804, and returned the following September. Their notes of
observation taken during these explorations, and reported to the association, show them to have been men of clear heads
and sound judgment.</P>

<P>September 24, 1804, a meeting was held, at which a new paper was presented in the nature and character of an article of
agreement, in which the subscribers bind themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators to the performance of the
several stipulations set forth in the paper. This is the most concise and explicit, in fact, the most lawyer like instrument of
writing that appears among the various papers of the company. Indeed it should have been such, as everything pertaining to
the success of the company depended upon its accuracy and binding effect. By this article of agreement the subscribers bind
themselves to become the purchasers of the number of acres of lands set opposite their names. The greatest number of acres
taken by one person was one thousand five hundred and the next greatest one thousand. These subscriptions were made by
Jesse Munson and James Smith. The average of subscriptions was about two hundred acres each. Levi Butler, Timothy
Rose, Job Case, Russel Atwater, Seth Hayes, Noahdiah Holcomb, Solomon Noble, Timothy Spellman, Levi Hayes, Samuel

<P>these articles of agreement on September 21, 1804, in Granville, Massachusetts, none now survive. General Augustine
Munson, it is believed, was the last survivor. He was a man of more than ordinary ability and importance in the Granville
colony. He was among the first purchasers of land in the township, and lived upon his farm until his death. A period of
more than sixty years. He built the first saw-mill in Granville township, and displayed much energy and enterprise as an
iron founder, canal contractor, and constructor of public works. He rendered efficient military services in the War of 1812;
was county commissioner a number of years, and a member of the State legislature from 1822 to 1824, filling all positions
of trust with marked fidelity and ability. His son, Captain M. M. Munson, writes as follows regarding his father and other
matters of historical interest:</P>

<P>"General Augustine Munson teas born in Granville, Massachusetts, September 30, 1783. He was the youngest child of
Jesse and Mariam Munson. At the age of ten years he carried on horseback the first through mail from Schenectady to Fort
Erie, the site of the present city of Buffalo. This journey he made through the then wilderness country with no other guide
than a pocket compass. At the age of fourteen he was sent to school at the academy in Lenox, where he remained some
time, when he was placed under the instruction of the late Dr. Cooley, who kept a select school for young men in Granville,
Massachusetts. In 1804, a company was formed in Granville, Massachusetts, called the Licking Land company, for the
purpose of buying land and effecting a settlement in Ohio. Munson was the youngest member who signed the articles of
association and emigrated with the colony in the fall of 1805, to Granville, Ohio. He was at the sale of the company held in
December of that vest, and became the purchaser of several lots of land as surveyed and sold by the company. In the year
1806 he built the first saw-mill in the township. It had a capacity of four thousand feet per day. This mill was of vast
importance to the new colony, as it furnished the only lumber for building to be had for miles around, and no mill since
constructed has ever done so much to meet the wants of this community. The winter following the coming of the colony
supplies of flour, salt, etc., had to be brought from Chillicothe and other distant points, and Mr. Munson was generally
employed in managing all expeditions in that line. In the years 1806 and 1807 he went to New York and New England to
adjust the unfinished business of the colony in that quarter.</P>

<P>In the years 1808 and 1809 expeditions to the lake for fish and other supplies were undertaken by him, and in the same
years flouring-mill was projected and completed much to the convenience and independence of the new settlement. Durin
these years he, together with the more gay and festive part the colony, organized a band of music, and instituted balls an
festal assemblies. At the commencement of the war of 1812, this band was mustered in as a regimental band, joining the
regiment of Colonel Cass, and was at the surrender of Hull at Detroit. Captain Levi Rose's company of infantry was
surrendered at the same time, and all came home on parole together. </P>

<P>"Munson was employed in forwarding supplies to General Harrison's army, and continued active in some branch of the
service till the treaty of peace was signed in 1815. Coming home from the war he, in company with his brother, Major
Jeremiah R. Munson, constructed and put in successful operation the 'Granville furnace.' This enterprise had more to do in
bringing trade and traffic to Granville than any one project before or since put on foot. After the furnace began to make
blooms he started the 'large works' for the purpose of making wrought iron. This work supplied a want heretofore much felt
in this part of the State. The iron in its various forms became a metallic currency-a medium of exchange of great value to
the settlers.</P>

<P>"The war of 1812 engendered a high military spirit all over the country, and General Munson, and the Granville people
were not exempt. Military drills had been in vogue from the first settlement of the township. It now grew in force, and
instead of a single company, a regiment was organized, and Munson was elected and commissioned as major at the election
in 1815; he was promoted to colonel, and remained in command of the regiment till the fall of 1818, when, in one of the
most spirited and exciting contests ever known in this part of Ohio, he was elected brigadier general over Colonel Simons,
of Mt. Vernon. So excited were the partizans in the contest, that one side demanded that the rival candidates should decide
the contest by a "passage at arms," and it is recorded that General Munson did not decline the combat. They were both good
swordsmen, but both had too good sense to make such fools of themselves for such an occasion. In 1821-22-23 General
Munson was returned to the lower house of the legislature where he took part in the discussion of, and voted for the
"Internal Improvement Measures," then being inaugurated in Ohio.</P>

<P>"In 1825 he became a contractor on the Ohio canal, building the Licking summit, Licking dam, deep cut, eight locks, etc.
all difficult and heavy jobs. These works bore ample testimony of his thoroughness and good faith as a contractor on the
public works. </P>

<P>" In the session of 1830-31, by his personal effort and influence, he secured the vote of the members from Licking county
for Mr. Ewing for United States senator, thereby putting the right man in the right place, securing to Ohio one of the ablest
members the State has ever had in either branch of congress. Mr. Ewing, it will be remembered, was elected by one
majority. General Munson was a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and when that gentleman came home with his cattle from
England, he 'visited Kentucky, and purchased some of that and previous importations. He afterwards gave considerable
attention to the introduction of improved short-horned cattle into Licking county.</P>

<P>"In 1842 he projected and put in operation a lard oil factory which, though he made superior oils, was not a financial
success. The fact of it being too far from the great markets where a greases accumulate and can be purchased at an
advantage, was the cause of its failure as a remunerative enterprise. From this time on the general spent most of his time on
his farm, never, however, losing his interest in all measures and projects that would redound to the advancement and
happiness of the whole country. He always kept an open house and a free table: His motto was 'Never breach the laws of
hospitality.'  Munson.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 433</STRONG></P>

<P>on reaching his majority in the fall of 1804, cast his first vote for Jefferson. He was a firm supporter of Mr. Madison's
measures in the war of 1812, and stood by the administration of that pure patriot and statesman all through the difficulties
and embarrassments that environed it. He voted for Mr. Monroe, and also for Mr. Clay, but gave a cordial support to the
administration of Mr. Adams who was made President by the action of Congress. At the reorganization of parties or rather
the formation of new parties which took place at this time, General Munson took sides with the Whigs, and supported the
measures and policy "the American Policy;" as he was wont to call it, of that party, so long as it remained a political
organization.</P>

<P>"General Munson was never hemmed in by the narrow limits of his own State, or circumscribed by any lines drawn inside
of the boundaries of the whole country. He had no sympathy with those who would sectionalize one part of the country
against the other, and held in execration him whoever or wheresoever he might be who would raise his parracidal hand
against the fair fabric of American constitutional liberty. It was the good fortune of Clay, Webster and other patriots of their
day and generation, who had stood by the country, to die when the sunshine of peace was over the land. Not so with
General Munson. After he had grown old and feeble, he saw the dark cloud of rebellion rise and burst in all its fury upon
the country; but Heaven generously lengthened his days to see the carnage of blood cease, and behold the dawn that
betokened a day of peace and reconciliation. Full of hope, and while the ship of State was still rocking on the troubled
waters, he was permitted to close his eyes in death. He died April 12, 1868, in the eighty-fifth year of his age."</P>

<P>The Licking Land company held various meetings in Granville, Massachusetts, during the fall and winter of 1804-05.</P>

<P>At a meeting held on the seventh of February, 1805, it was moved "to adjourn to meet the first Monday in December next
at nine o'clock A. M., on the Hardy section, purchased by the said company in the State of Ohio." The motion was carried
by a unanimous vote.</P>

<P>To carry into effect such a resolution, contemplated a work of .no little magnitude. It was the work of moving an entire
community by the slow process of team and wagon from the Connecticut valley to the then far western wilderness of Ohio.
Those accustomed to steamboat and railroad-car as a means of transit, can form but a feeble conception of the time, labor
and fatigue incident to such an undertaking. In the spring of this year a small company was sent forward to survey the land
purchased, build a saw-mill, clear ground and raise crops to feed the coming emigrants. Regarding the arrangements and
derangements, packings and unpackings, partings and departings, the tears of anguish, the hardships and privations of a
journey of so many hundred miles in the then crude condition of the roads and means of transit, the reader must draw upon
his imagination; but on November a, 1805, the advance corps of emigrants, consisting of five families, arrived within the
limits of this township. These were followed by daily accessions, so that before the setting in of winter forty-five families,
consisting of two hundred and thirty-four persons, had arrived.</P>

<P>November 16th (Sabbath), the first divine worship was held. Dr. Little; who for nearly forty years was pastor of the
Granville Congregational church, speaking of this meeting, says that although only about one dozen trees had been cut, they
held services both forenoon and afternoon.</P>

<P>The novelty of worshiping in the woods, the forest extending hundreds of miles in every direction, the hardships of the
journey, the winter setting in, the fresh thoughts of home, with all the friends and privileges left behind, and the
impressions made by their present accommodations compared with those they had relinquished; all bore with considerable
weight upon their minds, and made the day one long remembered. When they began to sing, the echo of their voices among
the trees was so different from what it was in the beautiful church they had left forever, that they could not restrain their
tears. The voices of part of the choir were for a season suppressed with emotion.</P>

<P>An incident in this connection is related of Deacon Theophilus Rees, who two or three years previously had settled on the
Welsh Hills. As this incident appears on page toy of this work, it need not be repeated here.</P>

<P>The committee for the company had purchased seven sections of land, comprising about twenty-eight thousand acres. Three
of these sections the second, called the Wells, the third, called the Hardy, and the fourth, called the Stanberry section-had
been re-surveyed by James Coe, the company surveyor, into one hundred acre lots, in the spring and summer before the
colony arrived. These sections comprised the southeast, southwest, and northwest quarters of what is now Granville
township. Mr. Coe had, agreeably to the instructions of the committee, laid out the town as near to the spot where these
three sections cornered as the face of the country would admit. This state-</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>434 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>ment reveals the why and the wherefore of the location of the town of Granville.</P>

<P>According to the terms of the article of association, a sale by public auction, to the highest bidder, of farm lots in the first
division, was held on the eleventh day of December. A consideration of this sale may be interesting as an index of the far
seeing judgment and moneyed abilities of the bidders. Their homes in New England had passed into the hands of strangers,
and themselves strangers in a strange land, with but the surveyor's plats and maps before them, while the lands represented
were in a dense wilderness with nothing but the axe-man's blaze to guide them to their future homes.</P>

<P>The auctioneer commenced: "How much is bid for the first choice." Every one in his own mind had made his selections;
but the quandary was, how many were of the same mind? For once in their lives it was not desirable that all should be of,
the same way of thinking. After several cries by the auctioneer the bidding commenced, and the first choice of the whole,
twelve thousand acres in this division, was struck off to Timothy Spellman for one hundred and thirty-eight dollars. He
took lot thirteen, range three. This lot is generally known as the Major Case farm. It includes all the village north of
Broadway and east of the Granger house, including the Female college, the Union school-house grounds and Mr. Price's
farm down to and including Odell's flouring-mill. Mr. Spellman, with his courage now up, bid in four more, making the
five first choices of an aggregate of seven hundred and thirty-six dollars and then went home, and it is said, slept none that
night, not from overjoy at his good fortune, but from thinking he had paid too deer. The amounts paid for the next forty
choices ranged higher than the first. The highest sum paid was for the forty-fourth choice, taken by job Case for three
hundred and forty-four dollars. He took lot twenty, range three. It lies one mile west of town and is known as the William
Sherman farm. A few lots were taken without any premium paid for choice. Lot twenty-five, range three; was awarded to
Ebenezer Cheney for nothing, there being no competition and no bidding. He was awarded the lot for the asking. It is the
east lot of Mr. Henry Reed's farm; the little stream called Cheney run, meandering through it.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The first division of lots having been disposed of, the- proprietors proceeded to sell the four other sections, which were
located in St. Albans, Hartford and Bennington townships.</P>

<P>The town plat, as surveyed, containing an aggregate of one hundred and seventeen acres, was subdivided into blocks and
then into lots.</P>

<P>Almost every colonist was the owner of a lot, and most of the houses built and improvements made during the first winter
were confined to the town plat, so that by the spring of 1806, Granville. had assumed the metropolitan appearance of a
small Indian village.</P>

<P>A house for the double purpose of school and church, was one of the first built. A school was taught during the winter, and
worship was regularly held both forenoon and afternoon of each Sabbath. The colon- had organized a church previous to
leaving New England. The meeting at which this organization was effected,'was held in East Granville, Massachusetts,
May 1, 1805. The official record is in rather quaint English, and is as follows:.</P>

<P>"We, the subscribers, ministers of the church of Christ, being at East Granville, a number of individuals, serious persons.
belonging to Granville, Massachusetts, and Granby in Connecticut, and being about to remove to Granville, in the State of
Ohio, requested to be formed into a regular church state previous to their departure. We attended to their request and
formed them accordingly, and recommend them to the care and favor of the Great Head of the church. Likewise, at their
request, we attended while they chose Timothy Rose and Levi Haves for their deacons, and Samuel Everett, jr., their clerk.</P>

<P>The confession of faith, the covenant and articles of discipline adopted by the church, are about the same as were in general
acceptation and use in the Calvinistic churches of New England, of that day. The male members present and signing the
articles of agreement were Samuel Everett, Israel Wells, Joseph Simmel, Timothy Rose, Roswell Graves, Job Case, Samuel
Thrall, Levi Hughes, Huron Rose, Samuel Everett, jr., Silas Winchel, and James Thrall.</P>

<P>The first meeting, according to the record held by this church after their arrival in Ohio, was February 7, 1806, at which
they took into consideration the expediency of choosing a special committee to correspond with missionary societies and
ministers of the gospel, on the subject of obtaining the ministrations of the word of God in this place. They chose for this
purpose James Coe and Samuel Everett, jr.</P>

<P>June 15, 1806, this church had the sacrament of the Lord's Supper administered to the members for the first time since their
removal here, by Rev. Samuel P. Robbins, pastor of the Congregational Church of Christ in Marietta. A regular record of
the church proceedings were kept by the clerk, Mr. Everett. This record shows that various lectures were read by the
secretaries, dating back as far as February 7, 1806. On Wednesday, February 19th, a lecture was read by Mr. Hoge, a
missionary of the general assembly. This was the Rev. Dr. Hoge, who settled about this time as pastor of the Presbyterian
church at Franklinton, and removed with that church to Columbus, remaining its pastor until his death, in 1864. His
pastoral labors with that people covered a period of over fifty years.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>April 24, 18o8, Rev. Timothy Harris, a licentiate from Vermont, preached his first sermon in Granville. On the nineteenth
of December of that year, Mr. Harris was ordained pastor. Revs. Lyman Potter, Samuel P. Robbins, James Scott, John
Wright, Jacob Lindley and Stephen Lindley were present and officiated. Mr. Harris graduated at Middlebury college,
Vermont, and came to Granville. a single man, but soon married Bethiah Linnell, daughter of Joseph Linnell. He was a man
of fair ability, good scholarship, great modesty and undoubted purity. He continued preaching many years in this church,
and died about the year 1822. His place was supplied by Rev. Ahab Jenks, who was dismissed about 1825. It was thought
that Mr. Jenks became obnoxious to the church, or a portion of it, because he consented that the masons who were at work
on a house he was building, late in the fall, might work on the Sabbath. After the dismissal of Mr. Jenks, they had no
regular pastor until about 1827 or 1828 when Rev. Jacob Little was settled.</P>

<P>Just previous to the death of Mr. Harris, or from 1818 to 1822, the state of religion and morals was rather low in Granville.
Mr. Harris had become an invalid, meetings were not regularly held, and but little religious interest was manifested. </P>

<P>Illustrative of this, some of the young people devised a theatrical performance, and obtained permission of the church
authorities to occupy the church for that purpose. A stage was improvised on the top of the unfinished pews. Tragedies
were performed, and perhaps some farces; comic songs were sung, and the performances were continued two nights. No
charge was made. The house was well filled; people coming from Newark and the surrounding neighborhoods. The names
of a few of the performers were Matthew Adams, jr., Hiram Pettibone, Stephen Smith, Calvin K. Warner, William Wing
and Jeremiah Jewett. The trustees, however, soon came to the conclusion that the church was not the proper place for such
performances. During Mr. Little's pastorate the following incident is said to have occurred: It was decided that a bell should
be purchased for the church. An estimate was made as to the cost, and a subscription raised to cover, as was supposed, the
expense of procuring the bell and hanging it in the tower. A day was appointed for raising it to its place, and the people
assembled in large numbers to witness he operation. Too late, it was ascertained that the cost of the bell and other expenses
were much more than was expected, and no more money could be procured to pay this debt. Everything was ready, the
people were assembled, and yet the raising was delayed, when it leaked out in some way that more money must be raised,
to pay the deficiency, else the bell could not be put in its place. The assembled crowd did not propose to be cheated out of
the object for which they came together; money enough was immediately raised to cover the debt and the bell put in its
place. It. is thought that this was the first church bell in the county.</P>

<P>A frame church edifice was erected about 1815, but not entirely finished until 1827, when Mr. Little took charge. This was
the building in which occurred the theatrical performances. Prior to the erection of this frame church in 1815, two others</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>436 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>had been in use by this congregation. One, a log, was erected in the winter of 1805-6, and was used until about 18io. It was
used as a school-house and church together, and for other public meetings. About 18io this congregation erected a small
frame which was in use until 1815, when the larger frame above mentioned was erected. This latter building was removed
about 1864, and the present fine brick edifice erected</P>

<P>Dr. Little's pastorate extended over thirty-nine years. He was very popular, a man of ability and influence, and much
beloved by his people. The society over which he presided was not only a religious society, but it had the courage as early
as 1831 to take a strong stand against intemperance. , Whiskey drinking, as is well known, was freely indulged in by men of
all parties and conditions, as well as by church members, even the Puritan blood of this church not excepted. Dr. Little was
a prime mover in this first temperance society, and its influence soon became so potent for good that strong drink was no
longer tolerated in the church.</P>

<P>Dr. Little was followed by Revs. David Beech and Mr. Dudley, and the present pastor, Rev. D. B. Hervey. This church is
yet large in numbers, and in a flourishing condition, having changed to Presbyterian about the time the old and new school
Presbyterian churches united.</P>

<P>The Sunday-school of this church was first organizid soon after the advent of the colony in the county, and has been
successfully continued until the present time, and is now large and active.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>It may be proper here to state that the first Presbyterian preaching in the township was probably by Rev. Thomas Marquis,
in 1803. This gentleman visited the Raccoon valley at that date and preached a sermon in an unoccupied cabin, probably
that erected by John Jones and vacated by him after the decease of his wife. Patrick Cunningham attended this service, and,
like all the settlers at that time, was poor and had hoped some of them would tender the requisite hospitalities to the
minister; but they all left without inviting him to remain over night, for the reason, perhaps, that each thought his means
inadequate to entertain him properly. After all had left, Patrick, whose theological views were in sympathy with those of the
preacher, of him that he would gladly entertain him, but that had nothing fit to set before him. On this subject a colloquy
took place between them which developed the fact that corn for the horse, and milk, corn bread and potatoes for the
preacher were on hand, whereupon a tarry until the next day was soon arranged. Mr. Marquis afterward, in 1807, held
communion service in Newark for the few scattering Presbyterians, and this is about the extent of his operations in this
county, so far as remembered. He was from Washington county, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P>The first Episcopal preaching in Granville, it is believed, was by Bishop Chase, of Kenyon college. On his way from the
east, he passed through this place, was requested to hold services and did so. His own short record of it is thus given in
1819; "On my way home, I preached and performed service at Granville. The audience, though assembled at two hours
notice, was attentive, and further services were requested."</P>

<P>From time to time Episcopal services were held  by different ministers passing through, but it did not become a regular
preaching station until 1826, when Rev. N. G. Baldwin, taking Granville in connection with Zanesville and Newark,
organized a parish here.</P>

<P>From that time to the present, though occasionally with long intervals of neglect, the parish of St. Luke's, Granville, has had
services. The following ministers have officiated: Revs. P. Chase, J. Morse, N. G. Baldwin, George Denison, S. A.
Bronson, \V. C. French, E. A. Strong, Thomas Corlett, E. B. Kellogg, C. S. Doolittle, and J. W. McCarty. </P>

<P>In proportion to its numerical strength and pecuniary ability, St. Luke's church ever set the other parishes of the diocese a
good example. Zealous, active and liberal, though but a small band, the members in 1837, erected on the public square a
house of worship, which externally was an ornament to the town, and internally tasteful and neat. With furniture and organ,
its total cost was a little over seven thousand dollars, in those days by no means a small sum.</P>

<P>St. Luke's was, for many years, self-supporting; able to keep a pastor of its own, and give him a respectable living; only,
however, by great effort</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 437</STRONG></P>

<P>and self denial on the part of its members, who, in the best days of the parish, never numbered more than sixty-seven.</P>

<P>That which mainly gave the church strength and stability was the presence of the ladies' seminary, connected with it. In
1838 Rev. Alvah Sandford commenced an Episcopal school for young ladies, which, for many years, was very successful.
The buildings in which this school was kept, had been erected by a Baptist society under the lead of Charles Sawyer, in
1832. Mr Sawyer becoming embarrassed, was compelled to dispose of the buildings, and they were purchased by the
Episcopal church.</P>

<P>Those connected with this institution, combined with resident Episcopalians, made a weak church comparatively strong.</P>

<P>This institution, passing into the hands of another principal, Rev. C. S. Doolittle, it was decided some years ago to remove
it to Mansfield. This was a misfortune to the people of St. Luke's, as it deprived them at once of the regular services of a
resident pastor-a deprivation which had the most depressing effect. Since that time the parish here has simply kept together,
holding its own, perhaps; having a few additions from time to time, but losing by removals about as much as it gains.</P>

<P>The main consolation of the good people of St. Luke's is, that what has been their loss, has been gain to some other parish,
that many of those who are an honor to the church, in other portions of the diocese, entered on their Christian course at
Granville.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Rev. J. W. McCarty ministered- to the church about ten years. Regular .preaching has not been sustained since 1873, but
occasional services are yet held. Rev. Hall now ministers to the people of this church occasionally.</P>

<P>The Rev. Edward Jones, now of Cincinnati, is believed to have preached the first Welsh sermon in Granville, at the
residence of Mr. Jenkin Hughes, about the year 1834. About this time also, a Sabbath-school was organized. These services
and Sunday-school exercises were conducted in a rented room over the post office.</P>

<P>Revs. Edward Jones, William Parry and William Morgan were occasional preachers until 1840, when Rev. William Parry
became the settled minister. He remained until 1852, and was succeeded by Rev. Joseph E. Davis. Rev. E. T. Evans became
the settled minister in 1856.</P>

<P>At the organization in 1839, William Ellis, John Jones and William T. Williams were elected elders. J. J. Hughes and John
R. Owens were subsequently elected.</P>

<P>A small Sabbath-school is connected with the church.</P>

<P>The first church edifice was erected in 1843; this was succeeded, in 1856, by the building now occupied. Services in this
church have always been conducted in Welsh.</P>

<P>The Welsh Hills Baptist church was organized September 4, 1808, in the cabin of David Thomas, by Elder James Sutton,
assisted by Mr. Steadman. It was styled the "First Regular Baptist Church of Granville," because of its location in Granville
township. It continued to be known by that name until 1819, when, upon the organization of the Regular Baptist church, in
the village, its name was changed to its present title.</P>

<P>The original members of this organization, nine in number, were Theophilus Rees, David Thomas, jr., Nathan Allyn, jr.,
David Lobdell, Joshua Lobdell, Thomas Powell, Elizabeth Rees, Elizabeth Jones and Mary Thomas. Theophilus Rees was
elected deacon, and Mr. Lobdell clerk.</P>

<P>They worshiped in private houses for some time, but a log building, with a puncheon floor, and, in size, . about eighteen by
twenty feet, was erected during the year 1809, on the Rees purchase, about one mile northeast of Granville, which was
used, more or less, for a church and school-house several years, when a building, twenty by twenty-four feet was erected
two miles north, of round logs, puncheon floor and pulpit.</P>

<P>Mr. Phillips donated a few acres of land in connection with this church for a cemetery, in which he and many of his family
and descendants are buried.</P>

<P>In 1822, this church was used as a school-house and accidentally burned down,</P>

<P>Deacon Theophilus Rees had also donated some</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>438 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>ground for a cemetery where the original church stood, which is yet known as the "Welsh Hills cemetery," and in which he
and his family are buried. It was given by him February 6, 1808, and on the same day, Rees, son of David Thomas, was
buried there, being the first interment. David Lewis and Simon James dug the grave.</P>

<P>These meeting-houses were used alternately, for the better accommodation of the old people of these neighborhoods.</P>

<P>A school-house, standing at a point about midway between these meeting-houses, was used some years for church
purposes, and private houses were, meanwhile, frequently used for this purpose, as well as churches.</P>

<P>In 1823, a large hewed log meeting-house was built near the site of the one that was burnt, where services were conducted
until 1834, when it, too, burnt during its occupancy as a school-house.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>After this, a stone school-house, on the farm of Rev. Thomas Hughes, was occupied by the church two years.</P>

<P>At present the services of this church are held in a comfortable frame church-building standing near the old Cambria mills,
erected in 1836. It is about thirty by forty feet in size.</P>

<P>Deacon Theophilus Rees may justly be regarded as the founder of the Welsh Hills church. Through his influence and
exertions it eras organized, and four of his family were among the first members of it. He lived only about four and a half
years after its organization, when it had attained to a membership of thirty. He died in February, 1813, aged sixty-six years.
He exercised the functions of deacon until his death, and was a useful, intelligent and Christian pioneer.</P>

<P>The Welsh Hills church was among the first organized in Licking county. The small Methodist organization on Hog run,
ministered to by Rev. Asa Shinn, in 1803-'4, and the organization effected on the eastern borders of the county through the
instrumentality and labors of Rev. Joseph Thrap, in 1805-6, together with the Congregational church of Granville,
organized in Massachusetts, in 1805, and a Methodist church in Newark, being the only ones of prior date, with in the
present limits of the county.</P>

<P>This small church had preaching very irregularly for the first two years of its existence. Rev. Thomas Powell preached
occasionally, and other pioneer preachers, braving the dangers and privations incident to life in the wilderness, sometimes
visited and preached for them. Meetings were, however, held regularly, and every month the church met for praise and
prayer. </P>

<P>June 10, 1810, Rev. J. W. Patterson, who had recently settled in the county, became settled pastor, and continued that
relation until 1816.</P>

<P>Elder John Mott, of Knox county, was chosen pastor, and although aged and infirm, continued his ministerial labors six
years. </P>

<P>During 1819, Elder George Evans supplied the pulpit temporarily, and for a year there was no settled minister. </P>

<P>About 1823, Mr. Owen Owens, of this church, was licensed to preach, and during his missionary operations, organized
"Liberty," "Genoa" and "Homer" churches.</P>

<P>In March, 1823, Elder Thomas Hughes, a licentiate from Wales, who settled in the neighborhood, was chosen pastor, and
supplied the church regularly until 1832, when he resigned. During his pastorate services were held in the stone
school-house, and in the old log church.</P>

<P>Elder James Berry served the church one .year after Elder Hughes resigned.</P>

<P>In 1833, Mr. Hughes again became settled minister, and served the church until 1841. </P>

<P>Seventeen persons united with the church during his ministry, and the aggregate reached seventy-one members. Mr.
Hughes' resignation was again reluctantly accepted, the church esteeming him a man of sound judgment, and of great
wisdom in counsel.</P>

<P>Elder James Sargent, a young man from Granville college, served the church very acceptably one year. During his ministry
thirty persons were received into the church. After his resignation, Messrs. Roberts and Owens, students from Granville
college, supplied the church a year or more.</P>

<P>In 1844, Elder David Pritchard, of New York State, was chosen pastor, and remained two years.</P>

<P>In 1846 William Smedmer engaged to supply the church three-fourths of the time, which he did until 1848, when he
resigned, and was succeeded</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 439</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>by E. S. Thomas, who remained about two years. He was succeeded in 1849 by Rev. J. W. Heistand.</P>

<P>In 1851 Thomas Hughes was called for the third time to the pastorate of this church, and died September following, after
having been a member of the church for fifty years, most of that time in the ministry.</P>

<P>After his death, the church was served some time by Rev. Dr. Bailey, president of Granville college, and Rev. J. Lawrence.
They were followed in 1853 by Rev. N. Clouse, who remained two years. In January, 1855, Rev. Dr. Hall became minister,
and served five years, frequently assisted by Mr. Clouse and Rev. E. D. Thomas. Mr. Clouse became pastor again in
January, 1863, and continued three years; being succeeded by Rev. B. J. Powell, who also served three years. President
Talbot followed for one year, and Rev. A. Jordon for nine months. Revs. J. Kyle, N. Clouse, Miller and Thornton have
successively occupied the pulpit since Mr. Jordon's time. During seventy-two years this church has been four and a half
years without a pastor. The longest pastorate, that of Rev. Thomas Hughes, was seventeen and a half years. At present there
are fifty members connected with the church; and the Sabbath-school, organized about 1825, contains sixty members.</P>

<P>The Muskingum association was formed in this church in May, 1811, in the building first erected, by Revs. William
Brundige, Jacob Drake, William Thrift and J. W: Patterson. This church remained with said association until 1841, when it
united with the Columbus association, with which it is yet connected.</P>

<P>The services in this church have generally been conducted in the English language, but occasionally in Welsh.</P>

<P>The First Baptist church of Granville was organized in 1819. In Howe's history of Ohio, it is stated that the first Baptist
sermon preached in Granville was by Elder Jones in 1806. This is undoubtedly the "Chaplain Jones" of revolutionary fame,
who often visited Licking county, and especially Granville and the Welsh hills, and preached to his Baptist friends, and a
sketch of whom will be found in another part of this work.</P>

<P>This society may be considered an offspring of the Welsh hills church, founded by Deacon Rees. When their numbers
increased sufficiently about Granville, they ceased attending the old church, and organized one of their own. In 1828 they
erected a brick church in the west part of town, upon the present site of Professor A. M. Thresher's residence, and since that
time have erected a frame church on the public square, opposite the Congregational church, and disposed of the old brick
building.</P>

<P>From the record dated June 6, 1819, the following names appear as the first members of the church: Levi Nichols, James
Hair, Abraham Chandler, Sanford Castile, Timothy Spellman, jr., Thomas Green, David Adams, Salome Squire, Mary
Atwood, Philander Jewett, Sarah Crow, Mary Drake, Rhoda Burnet, Annie Chandler, Jerusha Baker, Sarah Kelly, Betsy
Case, Lovina Woods and Polly Phelps.</P>

<P>After Chaplain Jones, Elder George Evans was probably the first preacher for the congregation. He continued his
ministerial labors from the organization of the church until October 26, 1822. He was a missionary from Massachusetts. At
the above date, he was succeeded by Elder John Hanover, who preached until 1825, and was succeeded by. Elders DeBolt
in 1825; Hanks, in 1826; James Berry, in 1828; Allen Darrow, after 1832; Henry Carr, from 1842 to x847; Silas Bailey and
Professor .John Pratt, until 1851; Jeremiah Hall, D.. D., from 1851 to 1853; N. S. Burton, eight years; J. D. King, one year;
J. C. Fernald, until 1873, and W. C. P. Rhodes to the present date (November, 1880.)</P>

<P>The Methodist Episcopal church of Granville, although .one of the first organized is, as usual, last to take steps for the
preservation of its history. No records have been kept until in later years, and consequently its earliest history has
disappeared. Howe's "Historical Collections" says</P>

<P>"In the ,fall (probably the fall of 1806, Though no date is given) the first Methodist sermon was preached under a black
walnut tree; the first class organized in 1810, and the first church erected in 1824."</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>440 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>It has been ascertained that this class organized in 1810 was at the house of William Gavit, by the Rev. James B. Finley.
This was then called the Knox circuit. The names of the members of this class do not appear, but the names of the ministers
that immediately succeeded Mr. Finley are Revs. Elisha W. Bowman, 1811; Michael Ellis, 1812; David Knox, 1813;
Samuel West, 1814; John Solomon and John McMahon, 1815; Shadrick Ruark, 1816; Henry Baker and Philip Green,
1817; Thomas Carr and Leonard Lane, 1818, and Thomas Carr and John Solomon, 1819. In 1820 the name of the circuit
was changed to Granville. Rev. S. B. Frampton is the present minister, and the church and Sabbath-school are in a
flourishing condition.</P>

<P>ONE of the most important legal instruments to the Granville colony was the partition deed, executed by Mr. Samuel
Everett. It partitioned the land among the people of the colony, and was , signed by seventy-eight proprietors, in the
presence of, and attested by, Abraham Wright, justice of the peace. It bears date of March 8, 1806, and contains
twenty-eight closely written pages of foolscap. It appears upon the records of Fairfield county, and is the most lengthy
written instrument of the kind upon the records of the county. It was executed gratuitously by Mr. Everett. He was a ready
accountant and good conveyancer. He was the father of Harlow, Revel and Israel Everett.</P>

<P>One of the things most needed for the convenience and improvement of the country was a sawmill. For the purpose of
building one, a millwright named Phelps, and four men as assistants, had been sent out to the purchase in the spring of
1805. They came in company with Mr. Coe and his surveying corps. A site near where the old furnace stood was selected,
and a temporary mill erected. They dammed the Raccoon for the purpose of procuring a supply of water, but evidently they
did not understand damming a western stream in a new country, and the first freshet swept it away. The mill was
abandoned before it was ready for operations. This was a drawback and disappointment to the colony; and from this cause
more light and transient dwellings were erected than otherwise would have been.</P>

<P>By the fall of 1806, a saw-mill had been erected further down the stream by Augustine Munson, with a capacity of four
thousand feet per day. A reasonable supply of lumber to meet the wants of the colony was now to be had, and the heavier
and more substantial structures began to be erected.</P>

<P>The first farm house was built by Deacon, afterward judge, Timothy Rose, in the winter of 1806-7, and stood where judge
Bancroft afterward resided. The first (forty by fifty) frame barn built in the</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 441</STRONG></P>

<P>county was erected in this township in the spring of 1807. The boards enclosing it were nailed on with Newgate nails, made
in the Connecticut State prison. Most of the boards and nails. are yet in their places.</P>

<P>The first male child born in the Granville colony was a son of Levi and Polly Rose, who became the well known Deacon
William Rose.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The first female child was the daughter of Justin and Adah Hillyer, afterward the wife of Deacon E. C. Wright.</P>

<P>May 12, 1807, the first marriage was celebrated. The parties were Samuel Bancroft and Clarissa, eldest daughter of judge
Rose.</P>

<P>It was the frequent remark of strangers and visitors to Granville in those early days, that no pioneer settlement in the west
could boast of so many marriageable and desirable young ladies as could Granville.</P>

<P>In 1807 an epidemic swept away a large number of young folks. </P>

<P>A burying-ground was laid out in the company's first survey. The first death and burial was that of an infant son of Ethan
Bancroft, who died April 6, 1806. On the twenty-second of August of the same year, Gideon Cromwell died, aged forty-five, and was the first interment of an adult person in this graveyard.</P>

<P>The pioneers of Granville early paid attention to the cultivation of music, both vocal and instrumental. Singing schools, to
learn church music, were held as early as the fall of 1806; and at all their social parties singing was part of the
entertainment. As early as 1808, a band for instrumental music was organized; it consisted of eleven performers; three
clarionets, three hautboys, three bassoons, one bass drum and cymbal. This was the first band west of Pittsburgh, if not of
the Alleghanies. It was the band of Cass' regiment in the War of 1812, and was in Hull's surrender at Detroit.</P>

<P>In the formation of the Granville colony an effort was made to have the professional and mechanical pursuits represented as
far as possible, so that among these pioneers men were found for almost any work or duty required, and they were,
therefore, better fitted in all respects to enjoy life than the majority of western pioneers, and their progress was, therefore,
more rapid toward the accumulation .of material and intellectual wealth.</P>

<P>In the spring of 1807 Dr. Lee settled in Granville, the first physician in this part of the county. He married Sabina, eldest
daughter of job Case, and subsequently removed to Coshocton. He was followed by Drs. Richards and Eager, men of
general education and professional skill. One of these was a regular graduate of Dartmouth and the other of a literary
institution in Rhode Island. . Granville has never been without medical men who would adorn that profession in any age or
community.</P>

<P>The first court ever held in the county was held on Centerville street, in this township, in a house that stood on the corner of
Levi Rose's garden. The grand jury held its inquest under a tree that stood near the guide post that points to Hebron.</P>

<P>Mr. William Wing was a resident of Granville township from 1818 to 1827, and has furnished some valuable history of
early times here. He died in Columbus, Ohio, February 13, 1878, in his seventy-ninth year. He came to Licking county from
Windsor, Connecticut, settling in Granville in 1818, where he married Electa Spellman in 1822. He was a merchant, a canal
contractor and, later in life, engaged in railroad business. He was well acquainted with the pioneer history of central Ohio,
and was often called upon to address pioneer gatherings. A few extracts following are taken from the few of these addresses
which appear in print:</P>

<P>"From 1818 to 1822 money was exceedingly scarce and produce low. The inhabitants had to live chiefly on what they were
able to raise and manufacture themselves. Business of most kinds was conducted by exchanging one article for another. It
was next to impossible to get money to pay debts. About this time a stay law was enacted by the legislature which virtually
suspended the forced collections of debt for some time. Produce would scarcely pay enough for transportation to any
market that was accessible. As an instance of this a company was formed at Granville, about the year 1820, called the
"Licking Exporting Company," for the purpose of sending produce, especially pork, to market. The hogs were put into
control of the company by the farmers, driven to Sandusky, there slaughtered, packed and shipped in the spring to
Montreal. Mr. C. Humphrey supervised the shipment, and went to Canada and made sales. About one dollar and
twenty-five cents per hundred was realized for the pork, and the operations of the company were not repeated.</P>

<P>" The prices of some articles of produce, about that time, were about as follows: Wheat, twenty-five to thirty-seven and
one-half cents per bushel; oats and corn, from twelve and one-</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>442 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>half to twenty cents; flour, from one dollar to one dollar and twenty-five cents per hundred weight; pork, one dollar and
fifty cents to two dollars; chickens, thirty-seven and one-half to fifty cents per dozen, butter, six to eight cents per pound;
eggs, three to four cents per dozen ; country sugar, six to eight cents per pound; country molasses-fifty cents per gallon (no.
foreign sugar or molasses to be had); coffee, when obtainable, about fifty cents, and tea two dollars and fifty cents to three
dollars per pound. Salt retailed for three dollars and fifty cents per bushel; whiskey, twenty-five cents per gallon; potatoes
and turnips, twelve and one-half to sixteen cents per bushel, and other articles in proportion. Even at these prices money
could not be obtained freely for them, there being no other than a home market. Merchandise and goods of all kinds could
be obtained only with great difficulty. The stores were bare of the real necessaries for the people, and all had to depend on
their own resources.</P>

<P>"From 1822 to 1825, there was a gradual improvement. merchants at Granville purchased the farmers' hogs and cattle,
drove them to an eastern market and returning furnished the people with merchandise suitable to their wants. From that
time the inhabitants were better accommodated. and the parties engaged in the business were benefitted and eminently
successful. The working of the Granville furnace by the same parties successfully, afforded' a market for considerable of
the produce raised by the farmers.</P>

<P>"Beginning work on the Ohio canal in 1825, gave an impetus to business, furnishing a home market for much of the surplus
labor and produce of the county. Great advances and changes soon took place. The people of Granville felt much interest in
that work, expecting to derive much benefit from the proposed side cut, or feeder. Meetings of rejoicing were had upon the
passage of the law, speeches were made, toasts offered and good feeling prevailed. A toast given by Judge Alexander
Holmes, of Newark, was as follows: 'The Licking summit-we are indebted to her depression for thus day's elevation.' A
well known citizen,. Chauncey Humphrey, in the height of his joy made this remark in relation to the prospects of
Granville: ' We shall be a second Utica.'</P>

<P>"But the expectation of advantages to be derived from the side cut to Granville, does not appear to have been realized, as it
has been useless for purposes of navigation many years. However, the people were generally benefitted by the prosecution
of the work.</P>

<P>"From the day of the beginning of the canal (July 4, 1825,) we may date the rapid advancement of the county and State in
wealth, prosperity and all the material elements which go to make a happy and prosperous people.</P>

<P>"The Newark <EM>Advocate, </EM>published by Mr. Briggs, at Newark,, was commenced in the year 1820. A good subscription list
was obtained for the paper at Granville; the papers were sent to a depository there by a carrier, for the subscribers. To fill
up his columns the publisher commenced publishing the life of Patrick Henry in weekly installments. Some of the
subscribers became dissatisfied. About this time Augustine Mun son was a candidate for the legislature; some one was sent
to the <EM>Advocate </EM>office to get tickets printed with Munson's name on them. Mr. Briggs, not favoring Munson's election it
was thought, declined to print them, assigning at a reason that he had so much printing on hand be could not do it in time.
course the parties were not pleased, and having been dissatisfied with his paper before, a number of the subscribers and
others, collected together, went to the depository where considerable accumulations of them were, and gathering them up,
formed a procession, and with muffled drums and fife marched to a cross street in the east part of the town and buried
them. Shortly after a number of subscribers took produce of various kinds to Newark to pay their subscriptions and stop the
paper. Briggs published in his next issue an article in regard to the matter, attempting to ridicule the people, and there the
matter ended; but the <EM>Advocate, </EM>after that time, never had much circulation there while he conducted it.</P>

<P>"After this a press was obtained by Mr. Sereno Wright, who was a practical printer, and the publication of a newspaper was
commenced by himself, called the <EM>Wanderer. </EM>'Uncle Sereno,' as he -a-as familiarly called, was considered a very honest,
upright man, but somewhat eccentric in character. Many stories used to be told of his peculiar ways in dealing with his
customers in his store, which he kept about this time. It is probable they were not true, or if they were, they were not to his
prejudice, but only illustrative of his eccentricities. He afterward served as county treasurer a number of years with great
acceptability. The Jackson party finally became dominant in the county and he was obliged to give way."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The <EM>Wanderer </EM>spoken of by Mr. Wing, was established in 1822, and was the second paper started in the county. It was
devoted to news, advertising, and the interests of the little village in which it was published. It was small in size, contained
little reading matter, and .was issued by "Uncle Sereno," and one of his boys. The latter fell down stairs one day, seriously
injuring himself, which circumstance led to the suspension of the <EM>Wanderer. </EM>This was about two years after it started.
Newspapers were not in great demand in this county in the days of the <EM>Wanderer.</EM></P>

<P>Probably the next paper started in Granville was the <EM>Granville Intelligencer </EM>in 1847, by D. Hunt and H. C. Blackman. Mr.
James Taylor may also have been connected with the <EM>Intelligencer </EM>before its name was changed to the <EM>Licking Bee </EM>in 1851,
as it was afterward.</P>

<P>These papers were devoted to the interests of Granville, were well conducted, well printed and exerted a good influence.
The <EM>Bee </EM>advocated the Maine Law in 1853, and was always strongly for temperance. Both of these papers were
independent in politics.</P>

<P>The <EM>Denisonian, </EM>a literary periodical, conducted by the students of the Denison university, was commenced in 1857. Henry
Fulton, H. E. Jones, J. B. Shaf, I. M. Clemens, J. H. Sedwick and J. B. Jones appear as editors, at different times. It was a
clever publication, but died in 1859, and was</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 443</STRONG></P>

<P>buried with literary honors, J. B. Jones delivering the funeral oration.</P>

<P>The Herbarium was a literary periodical issued in Granville, in the interest of one of the literary institutions of that place. It
was the contemporary of the <EM>Denisonian, </EM>and lived as long at least, perhaps longer. It was conducted, probably, by the
young ladies of Mr. Kerr's seminary.</P>

<P>The Collegian, a magazine of thirty-two pages, was started by the members of the Calliopean Literary society of Dennison
university, in July, 1867, with Thomas Ewart, F Catworthy, and F. Austin Drew as editors, and H. A. Rogers and C. M.
Rupe publishers. It was published by this society two years. In 1869, the Franklin Literary society united with the
Calliopeans in its publication, and from the commencement of the third volume it was issued as the <EM>Dennison Collegian,
</EM>and under the auspices of these societies it is ably conducted.</P>

<P>The Granville Times, a weekly Republican paper, was established in June, 1880, by Harry A. Church, the first number
appearing on Friday, June 11. The paper is a five column folio, and is principally devoted to the interests of Granville
township. It has been placed upon a paying basis, and is a welcome sheet to almost every family in the township. Although
supporting the principles of the Republican party, it is liberally encouraged by men of both parties, Rev. A. Y. Yale, of
Alexandria, now prints a periodical in the <EM>Times </EM>office. It' is noticed in the chapter on St. Albans township.</P>

<P>Mr. Wing's paper is again quoted:</P>

<P>"Of the first pioneers who were .living in. 1818, Joseph Linnel, sr., Levi Rose, Deacon. Levi. Haves, Roswell Graves, Job
Case, Samuel and Azariah Bancroft, Justin Hillyer, sr., Timothy Spellman, Elias Gilman, Silas Winchel, William Gait,
Amos Carpenter, and Hiram Rose, are remembered-all now dead.</P>

<P>"Of the descendants of the first settlers and others residing there at the time are recollected the following: Augustine,
Jeremiah R. and Jesse Munson, Spencer Wright, Elkanah Linnel, Grove Case, Curtis, Amara, and Daniel Howe, Benjamin
and Jacob Cook, Oren and Ralph Granger, David and Campbell Messenger, P. Pritchard, Elias Fassett, Willard Warner,
Hiram and Samuel Boardman, Jacob Apollos Griffin, the Mower family (father and son;), and many others whose names
are not now recalled.</P>

<P>"The first postmaster at Granville Was Judge Rose; the next, William Gavit. Sereno Wright succeeded him and was
postmaster there in 1818, and so remained many years.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The physicians in practice were W. S. Richards and a Dr. Moulton. Dr. Sylvester Spellman settled there about 1820, and
was in practice many years. Some other physicians came there but did not remain long.</P>

<P>"At an early period an act of the legislature incorporated the Granville Alexandrian society. It was supposed the law
conferred banking powers, accordingly a bank was established about 1814 or 1815.</P>

<P>"The banking house was a one-story stone building, and stood at the southeast corner of Broad street and the public square.
It issued circulating notes and did a general banking business. I am not certain who its first directors and officers were, but
believe Elias Gilman, Silas Winchel, and Timothy Spellman, residents of Granville, were of the board, with Alexander
Holmes, of Newark, as president, and R. R. Roach, as cashier. Subsequently G. Swan was cashier, and he was succeeded by
Elisha S. Gilman. This was, no doubt, the first banking institution in the county.</P>

<P>"In 1817, in common with other banks in the State, such as the Owl Creek bank of Mt. Vernon, and others, the bank failed
to redeem its notes, and suspended payment, when its notes greatly depreciated. In 1836 the bank was revived, principally
by Buffalo parties. Henry Roop was made president, and A. G. Hammond cashier. Mr. Hammond did not continue long,
and A. J. Smith succeeded him. Mr. Roop retired from the presidency after a time, when his place was supplied by some
person interested in the bank in Granville. The public did not have great confidence in this bank, its issues not being in
much favor, and it suspended payment in 1841. Its business was wound up by order of the court, and, I believe, some of its
stockholders were made individually liable for its outstanding notes.</P>

<P>"The Granville furnace was built in 1816, by J. R. and A. Munson. It was supposed that ore could be obtained about four
miles west of Granville. This proved to be a mistake, and the ore had to be transported by wagon from :Nary Ann township,
and other places, distant twelve or sixteen miles. After the completion of the canal ore was obtained from Zoar, in
Tuscarawas county. The operations of the furnace were not successful until it passed into the hands of L. D. Mower and his
associates in 1822 or 1823, when it became profitable. In 1825 Elias Fassett purchased the interest of L. D. Mower S Co.,
and carried on the business some years. From 1830 to 1838 the persons interested in it were Elias Fassett, Alfred Avery, P.
W.. Taylor, Elizur Abbott, Simeon Reed, D. L. Cook, and D. D. Jewett. It was finally abandoned in 1838.</P>

<P>"A forge was built by A. Munson on Raccoon creek, two miles from town, and worked for a time with partial success; it
was built about .the time the furnace was erected. Colonel A. Jewett worked it in 1824 and 1825, but was unsuccessful. A.
Munson had a grist and saw-mill on the site of the forge; Grove Case had a grist-mill on Clear run, adjoining the town on
the east.</P>

<P>"Distilleries were common. The parties operating them were Joseph Fassett, Royal Marsh, Silas Winchell, and another
name not recollected, about a mile and a half west of town.</P>

<P>"The Ohio canal opened a market for much of the whiskey manufactured; price twelve and a half cents per gallon by the
barrel.</P>

<P>"A saw-mill was carried on by Captain John Phelps, about three-fourths of a mile southeast of town. He will be
remembered by some of the older residents as going by the name of "Captain Put." He became partially deranged about
1824,</P>

<P>traveled about from place to place, and when he came into a town he would call his roll, naming persons whose names he
had obtained. I recollect hearing him call it one day in Granville. What became of him I do not know, but have the
impression that he wandered off to the State of New York, or some of the New England States, from whence he came, and
died.</P>

<P>" An oil-mill was built at an early day on Clear run, north of town, near the Welsh Hills road. It was run for a time but  soon
discontinued. Two tanneries were in operation in 1818, one carried on by Spencer Wright, near Clear run, east of town, and
the other by George Donnovan on a lot afterward occupied by Harvey Bragg, near the spring.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"A salt well was sunk some hundreds of feet, about three-fourths of a mile southwest of town at an old deer-lick. Salt water
was reached and a furnace erected to make salt, but on testing the water, two bushels of salt per day was all that could be
made, and the enterprise was abandoned. Another well was commenced on Moat's run, in St. Albans township, but did not
come to anything. I think these enterprises were undertaken in 1822 or 1823.</P>

<P>"There were four ponds of standing water on the town plat, one at the junction of Broad street and the Columbus road, one
on the north side of the public square; one in the street fronting the house occupied by Rev. Mr. Little, and the other north
of Broad street, and west of the street leading north toward Mt. Vernon. By voluntary labor contributed by the people in
town and country, they were filled up and drained in 1826, and the unsightly nuisances abated.</P>

<P>"The old burying ground south of town, containing some twelve or fifteen acres, was first surrounded with a wooden fence,
which became decayed. In 1820 the inhabitants turned out and built a good, substantial wall around the lot, which still
remains. A new cemetery has been established and dedicated in the past few years, southeast of the town plat.</P>

<P>"There were two or three woollen factories in the township at an early day. The original proprietors were William Paige,
Horace Wolcott, James 'Mead, and Linus G. Thrall; there may have been others whose names are not remembered.</P>

<P>"The people of the township and county were supplied with plows made at Granville. The first manufactured was the "bull
plow," so called; the woodwork made by tire Blanchards, and the iron (all wrought) by Colonel Alpheus Jewett, and
afterwards by Allen Sinnet, Hugh Kelley and others. The Blanchards and Woodbury also built wagons, carts and other
things.</P>

<P>"In 1831 a Mr. Bunker, from Troy, New York, started, on the site of the old forge referred to, an extensive manufactory of
plows, of the "Wood's patent." They were of cast iron, so far as iron was used. These plows came into general use; had a
wide market, and gave great satisfaction.</P>

<P>"A very considerable business was carried on from 1820 to 1825, in quarrying and cutting stone for building purposes, also
grave stones, by Josiah Taylor, P. W. Taylor, and others. Several teams were kept running in the country peddling grave
stones, and it is supposed that those engaged in the business did well.</P>

<P>"The first lodge of Free Masons in Licking county was instituted at Granville, called "Center Star." It had members from all
parts of the county, and had a Royal Arch chapter. I believe it still continues in working order.</P>

<P>"The people were foremost in the county in the formation o a temperance society in 1828.</P>

<P>"Linnel, French &amp; Brace had a clock factory five miles west of Granville, and had several men in their employ. In 1825 or
1826, Franklin county was a part of the congressional district, and Lyne Starling, of Columbus, was a candidate for
Congress. He came to Granville on an electioneering excursion, and was introduced to the people as a candidate to
represent them. Hearing of the clock factory he wished me to go there with him, which I did. After spending some time
with the principals, as we were about leaving, he inquired the price of a clock, and directed them to send him one; it was
sent to my care and forwarded to him at Columbus. He paid for the clock, but whether he received the votes of the parties
or their employes I do not know, but he was not elected. The clock factory was afterward removed-to Granville, and stood
north of the building now occupied by the First National bank of Granville, and carried on by French &amp; Brace, 'Mr. Linnel
having withdrawn.</P>

<P>"The kind of clock manufactured by them was the old fashioned Yankee clock.</P>

<P>"From 1818 to 1828 the attention of the people was called to military matters, Regimental and company musters were
regularly kept up. There were three uniformed companies, one of infantry, one of artillery and one of cavalry, commanded
respectively by Captains Timothy Spellman, jr., Willard Warner and P. W, Taylor. There were also two companies of
militia ('flood-woods' and 'barefoots'), one in the south part of the township, commanded by Captain Myron Phelps, and one
in the north part commanded by. Captain Alpheus Jewett, who afterward became colonel of the regiment. The writer had
not much military taste, but was appointed pay master of the regiment, and was mustered as such, but is not aware that any
money came into his hands, wherewith to make any payments.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The first and only cannon ever made in the county was cast at the Granville furnace, for the artillery company, and bored
out in a stable near where the clock factory stood, and mounted for the company. It was used at the celebration at Licking
Summit in 1826, at the beginning of the Ohio canal.</P>

<P>"In 1818 Griffin &amp; Humphrey had a stock of goods in the store next east of the old bank building. Mr. Humphrey sold his
interest to Elisha S. Gilman, the firm then being Griffin &amp;  Gilman. They did not replenish the stock, and soon gave up the
business. Matthew Adams, jr., had a stock of goods in 1829, or 1820, but I do not recollect who was concerned with him.
His store was next west of R. Granger's tavern; but he was not successful, and the business was closed up. Fitch &amp; King
opened a stock of goods, and, I believe, Matthew Adams, Jr., assisted them; but they did not remain long. Sereno Wright 
kept some articles of merchandise in part of his dwelling, southwest corner of the public square; and the post office was
kept there, he being postmaster.</P>

<P>"Charles Saw-ver came to Granville in 1817. He was a saddler by trade, and carried on the business in a small, red building,
on the lot now occupied by Doctor Spellman's dwelling house. In 1819 or 1820 he began keeping some articles of
merchandise, and from small beginnings and close attention to business, he had accumulated considerable property by the
year</P>

<P>1830. At or about this time he became a zealous member of the Baptist church, and felt it his duty to contribute liberally of
his means towards the enterprises of his church, one of which was the building of a female seminary, with a spacious
boarding house attached. The buildings were located in the northwestern part of town. The seminary was occupied and well
patronized.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 445</STRONG></P>

<P>Mr. Sawyer having contributed so freely of his own means, became embarrassed and was obliged to take the building and
its surroundings in payment of his advances on account of it, and to relieve himself was obliged to sell it to the Episcopal
church, but did not realize near what he had paid out. He removed to Newark soon after, in 1850 to Columbus, and from
thence to Springfield, Illinois.</P>

<P>"About 1822 L. D. Mower commenced merchandising, built a new brick store-house on the south side of the street,
between the houses occupied by Doctor Spellman and Dr. Paul Eagar. His brother, Horatio, and Alfred Avery were
associated with him; and after Horatio's death his brother Sherlock w-as a partner. Mr. Mower also worked the furnace until
he disposed of his interest in that enterprise to E. Fassett, as before mentioned. Afterward A. P. Pritchard was a partner of
his in the sale of goods in 1830, under the firm name of Mower &amp; Pritchard. Mr. Mower was a very thorough business
man, and a man of great energy and perseverance, and acquired a handsome property. He died in 1834 or 1835.</P>

<P>"A. P. Pritchard was probably the first druggist in the county. He had a chemical establishment or labratory in connection
with the drug business, near the spring, in the northwest part of town.</P>

<P>"Other patties were engaged in merchandising from 1820 to 1838, whose names are as follows: Elias Fassett, Alfred Avery,
P. W. Taylor, D. R. Cook, Elmer Abbott, Doctor Sylvester Spellman, Simeon Reed, D. D. Jewett and George Abbott. Some
of these parties were also engaged in the furnace, their names appearing in a former paragraph. It is supposed that these
gentlemen were generally successful in their undertakings. A steam flouring mill was built near the furnace in 1831, by P.
W. Taylor &amp; Co. After the feeder had been finished to Granville, the mill was removed to the site of the old Phelps
sawmill, before referred to.</P>

<P>"In 1832 the question was agitated of building a new court house. The people of Granville became much excited on the
subject, and made great efforts to get the county seat removed to this place, offering to build the county buildings without
charge to the county, or contribute largely thereto. Newark, however, being in possession, and being on the main line of the
canal, overcame the enterprise of the Granvillians, and the county seat remained at Newark, and the people of Newark were
not required to contribute anything to retain it.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The Granville feeder extended from Licking summit to Raccoon creek at Paige's woollen factory, about a mile and a
quarter southeast of town. In order to have navigation as near the town as possible, the canal commissioners agreed to make
the feeder navigable for boats to Paige's factory, provided the people of Granville would. make it navigable from thence to
the bridge at the Lancaster road. This they agreed to do. It involved a considerable expense, as a dam, guard-lock, lift-lock,
and about half a mile of canal had to be built to render it navigable.</P>

<P>"A warehouse was erected at the. head of navigation, and a boat built there by the Troy and Ohio line, under the
superintendence of a Mr. Wallace, and it is supposed that it was the first canal-boat built south of Cleveland. The feeder
was navigated until the furnace was abandoned in 1858, since which it has become dilapidated and out of repair.</P>

<P>During the construction of the canal, many of the citizens were engaged as contractors on the work, among whom were A.
Munson, L. D. Mower, P. W. Taylor, Sylvester Hayes, Levi Rose, Alfred Avery, Elias Fassett, Joseph Fassett, Simeon
Reed, Byron Hayes, William Wing, Justin Hillyer, jr., Curtis Howe, Ashley A. Bancroft, Hugh and Dennis Kelley. Several
of the above had large contracts, and they generally enjoyed the confidence of the canal commissioners. I have no doubt
that more of such work was done by these people than was done by the people of any other township or county in the State.
So far as I know, it is believed their contracts were generally remunerative.</P>

<P>A water-cure was established in 1852, by Dr. W. W. Bancroft. The establishment was well patronized from the first, and
has been very successful in the treatment of chronic and other diseases.*</P>

<P>"In the late war for the suppression of the Rebellion, it is understood that the people of Granville patriotically responded to
the calls of the Government, in all cases filling their quotas, and contributing in every possible way to aid and assist those
and the families of those who were called to the front. Several of the Granville boys shed their blood and lost their lives in
the service of the country, and in defense of free institutions.</P>

<P>In a paper read on the Fourth of July, 1871, at Utica, Mr. Wing continues:</P>

<P>"Revel Everett was a Granville man. I remember him as being constable of the township. Afterwards he removed to
Hartford, and for a time was engaged in merchandising and where he has continued to reside ever since.</P>

<P>"David Messenger, of the committee, I recognize as an old familiar friend, one whom I have known about as long as any
other in the State, he being a resident of Granville when I arrived. He was a shoemaker by trade.. I think he did not take
kindly to it, or the business did not suit him. He acquired considerable reputation as a player on the violin, and at the first
dancing party I attended, six days after my arrival, be was one of the musicians who made music for the dance. The other
player was Fish, of Johnstown, and their 'Money Musk,''Fisher's Hornpipe,' and other tunes for country dances were not
often excelled. About 1821 he came to Utica and engaged in merchandising, and continued the business some years.</P>

<P>"I believe none of the first settlers of Granville township now survive. There are few townships in the county whose
reputation is as good as that of Granville, or one that has done more for the advancement of good morals and public and
private enterprises."</P>

<P>In his paper read on the Fourth of July, 1872, at Newark, he says:</P>

<P>"Oren and Ralph Granger, brothers, each kept a tavern in Granville, and kept good houses. Oren died in 1821 or 1822;
Ralph continued in the same business at times until 1830, when he removed to his farm, and died about 1866. Willard
Warner kept a tavern in Granville four or five years and removed thence to Newark, where he kept at the Houston stand
sometime. He was a mail contractor and represented Licking county in the senate one term.</P>

<P>" Major J. R. Munson was by profession a lawyer and was a man of good natural ability; was a representative in the
legislature when it met at Chillicothe, and was said to have been instrumental in obtaining the charter of the Granville
Alexandrian society, which, it was supposed, conferred banking</P>

<P>* This institution went out of existence two or three years ago.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>446 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>powers. He was not fortunate in his business enterprises, and died in 1821 or 1822. </P>

<P>"Elias Fassett, before mentioned as a business man of Granville, removed to Cleveland and thence to New York, engaging
first in the dry goods business, then in brokerage, dealing in bonds and stocks until 1856, when he returned to his farm near
Granville; was elected president of the Central Ohio railroad company, holding the position some two years, and retiring to
his farm, where he died suddenly in 1863." </P>

<P>In the early days of the agitation of the slavery question-between 1825 and 1840 when an abolitionist was something of a
curiosity in this county, Granville had her share of them, and her share of trouble in consequence. Quite an anti-slavery
society was organized in that place, and although they dare do or say nothing openly for some years, ' they grew bolder by
degrees, and began to hold meetings and have public speaking upon that all important subject. The men of Granville
generally had minds and thoughts of their own upon all subjects, and Puritan blood was generally largely impregnated with
abolition blood. Something was done here on the underground railway, and there were a few zealous workers in the
abolition cause at all times, and their numbers continually increased. A majority of the people were, how- ever, pro-slavery,
as they were everywhere in the North.</P>

<P>About April 1, 1835, a Mr. Weld, an abolitionist, undertook to deliver a lecture in Granville, and was stoned and egged by a
mob. He had lectured a few days before at Circleville, where he had also received rough treatment; the mob throwing eggs
and stones through the window.</P>

<P>"One of the stones was so well aimed that it struck me on the head, and, for a moment, stunned me. I paused a few
moments until the dizziness had ceased, and then went on, and finished my lecture. Meanwhile, some of the gentlemen had
hung their cloaks up at the window, so that my head could not be so easily used as a target."</P>

<P>The above extract is from a letter written by Mr. Weld at the time, and is evidence of what an abolition lecturer had to
endure.</P>

<P>In the following year, 1836, the following notice appeared in the Newark Gazette:</P>

<P>"We, citizens of the town of Granville, in the county of Licking, and State of Ohio, having understood from common
report, and from certain notices published in newspapers, that a State convention of delegates from the Abolition societies
of Ohio is to be held in this place on the twenty-seventh day of April, ensuing; and having had bitter experience, in times
past, of the evil effects of abolition meetings, as tending to destroy the peace of society, and introduce discord and
contention through all its constituent departments; and learning that a great and increasing excitement already exists, not
only in our own, but in the neighboring towns, in prospect of the contemplated meeting-we do, therefore, most earnestly
remonstrate against any such meeting being held in our town on the twenty-seventh day of April, or any other day in the
year. And we most earnestly call upon and request all officers and leaders of the abolition society, and all who are, or may
be, appointed delegates to the said convention, if they have the least regard for our peace and welfare, or for the well-being
of the religious, moral, and literary institutions established among us, to abstain from coming to said meeting. And we do
hereby engage to use our lest endeavors, by all lawful and proper means, to prevent any such public meeting from being
held within the limits of our corporation.</P>

<P>"Granville, March 31, 1836."</P>

<P>This notice was signed by Elias Fassett, mayor; Samuel Bancroft, recorder; William S. Richards, Knowles Linnel, S.
Spellman, S. Mower, Daniel Wildman, council, and by sixty-nine other citizens.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding this, the abolitionists held their meeting, though not, it seems, within the corporation. Mr. Briggs, in an
editorial published in the Advocate, April 30, 1836, thus gives the result, heading his article "Bloody Wars in Canada:"</P>

<P>"The abolition convention adjourned on Thursday about noon. The day was distinguished by- violence and bloodshed,
though fortunately no lives were lost.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"On Wednesday evening, the abolitionists held a meeting in a school-house, about a mile south of Granville. During the
evening a mob collected, and broke the windows with stones. They were driven off by the abolitionists. They dispatched
expresses during the night to Martinsburgh, Utica, Mount Vernon and Newark, for re-inforcements, and accordingly a 
number of recruits were in the field on the next day, armed with clubs and ready for action.</P>

<P>"Twelve o'clock on Thursday was the time fixed upon for the commencement of hostilities. The convention adjourned
about that time, and many of the members accompanied by ladies, formed a procession about a mile from the village where
the convention sat, and marched through the principal streets, where the mob was assembled. When they reached that point,
the mob commenced hissing and yelling, and followed the procession to the ladies' academy, where the ladies left the
procession; and then both parties resorted to clubs, dirks and brickbats, which they employed as knock-'em down arguments
for and against the abolition scheme. The fighting continued at intervals for some time. One of the mob was dirked, and
some of the abolitionists were knocked down with clubs, and one was pelted with eggs most unmercifully. Three abolition
horses' manes and tails were closely shaved."</P>

<P>In another part of the same issue, Mr. Briggs says:</P>

<P>"We are told that upwards of four thousand dollars were</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. - 447</STRONG></P>

<P>contributed by the abolitionists at Granville on Wednesday night, to support a press that is about to be established at
Cincinnati, and to defray the expense of printing abolition tracts."</P>

<P>It will be seen from the above that both parties were very determined, and that the abolitionists were especially
wide-awake, active, belligerent, in earnest, and ready with brain, muscle and money to further their cause. Thirty years from
that time their cause emerged from the smoke, dust and blood of battle, triumphant.</P>

<P>The following regarding Granville is from Howe's Collections:</P>

<P>"When Granville was first settled it was supposed that Worthington would be the capital of Ohio, between which and
Zanesville this would make a great half-way town. At this time, snakes, wolves and Indians abounded in this region. On
pleasant spring mornings, large numbers of snakes were found running on the flat stones. Upon prying up the stones, there
was revealed a singular fact respecting the social nature of serpents. Dens were found containing very discordant materials.
twenty or thirty rattlesnakes, black-snakes and copper-heads, all coiled up together. Their liberal terms of admission only
seemed to require evidence of snakeship. Besides various turnouts to kill them, the inhabitants had one general hunt. Elias
Gillman and Justin Hillyer were the captains, who chose sides, and the party beaten were to pay three gallons of whiskey.
Tradition is divided as to the number killed that day; some say three hundred. They killed that year between seven and eight
hundred rattle-snakes and copper-heads, keeping no account of the black and other harmless serpents. The young men
would seize them by the neck and thrash them against the trees, before they had time to bite or coil around their arms. The
copperhead, though smaller, was much more feared. The rattle-snake was larger, sooner seen and a true southerner, always
living up to the laws of honor. He would not bite without provocation, and by his rattles gave the challenge in an honorable
way. Instead of this well-bred warfare the copperhead is a wrathy little fellow, whose ire is always up, and he will make at
the hand or the foot in the leaves or grass, before he is seen, and his bite is .as poisonous as that of his brother of the larger
fang. The young men tested his temper and found that in his wrath he would bite a red hot coal. Very few were bitten by the
rattle-snake, and all speak well of his good disposition and gentlemanly manners; but so many were bitten in consequence
of the fractious temper of the copper-head, that he has left no one behind him to sound a note in his praise.</P>

<P>"The limb bitten became immediately swollen, turned the color of the snake, and the patient was soon unable to walk.</P>

<P>In some cases the poison broke out annually, and in others the limb for years was inclined to frequent swellings. After all
that was suffered from poisonous reptiles, it was proved to a demonstration that no animal is so poisonous as man. Carrying
more poison in his mouth than any other creature, he can poison a venomous serpent to death quicker than the serpent can
him. Martin Root and two other young men, chopping together, saw a rattle-snake, set a fork over his neck, and put into his
mouth a new quid from one of their mouths. They raised the fork, and the poor creature did not crawl more than his length
before he convulsed, swelled up and died, poisoned to death by virus from the mouth of one of the lords of creation.
Deacon Hayes and Worthy Pratt tried the same experiment upon copper-heads, with the same result. Many others killed
venomous reptiles in the same way, and one man pretended that by moderate use he had taught a copper-head to take
tobacco without injury."</P>

<P>Of the adult pioneers of the Granville colony who came here in 1805, all are dead; a few of their children, however, whom
they brought here at that date are yet living. Among them are Franklin and Ezekiel Gavitt, who live in Delaware county;
Timothy M. Rose, yet living in Granville; Hiram P. Rose, living in Indiana; Justin and Truman Hilliar; Justin in Kansas and
Truman in Columbus, Ohio. Sylvanus and Gideon Comel are probably living. Leverett and Charles Butler are yet living in
this county.</P>

<P>The Center Star lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, spoken of in Mr. Wing's paper as being first in the county, was
organized by Mr. Job Case, Timothy Spellman, Justin Hillier, David Butler, and Elias Gilman. These gentlemen having
received the degrees of symbolic Masonry in New England, united with a few others and presented a petition to Lewis
Cass, grand master of Masons in Ohio, early in 1810, praying for a dispensation to organize a lodge in Granville. Mr. Cass
came to Granville in person and organized the lodge, in the upper room of the dwelling of Deacon Timothy Rose. The
lodge was chartered in January, 1811, and numbered eleven persons. Its first officers were: Job Case, worthy master;
Timothy Spellman, senior warden, and Noble Landon, junior warden. The first place of meeting was a room in the second
story of the residence of Elias Gilman; finished of. for that purpose. The first Masonic hall in the county was ten by
fourteen and a half feet in size. It had a window on the east side, a fire-place on the west side, and was the first room
finished off and plastered in Granville. About a year after the organization of the lodge, a larger and more convenient room
was secured in the residence of Grove Case. The first candidate initiated in this lodge was Hiram Rose. The first return to
the Grand lodge included 1810 and 1811, and showed a membership of twenty Master Masons, and, at the end of 1812, the
membership had increased to thirty-nine.</P>

<P><HR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>448 - HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY</STRONG>.</P>

<P>The nearest lodges to Granville, in those days, were at Worthington, Mt. Vernon, and Zanesville.</P>

<P>The first death in the lodge was that of James Thrall, in 1813.</P>

<P>The "fourth step in Masonry" was introduced into this lodge June 30, 1814, and Timothy Spellman was passed to the chair
of King Solomon.</P>

<P>Center Star lodge went down in 1837, but was resuscitated again in 1850, and has continued in successful operation to the
present time.</P>

<P>The Granville of the present day is a beautiful, pleasant, healthy village, the people being more devoted to religious and
educational matters than, perhaps, any other town of its size in the State.</P>

<P>About 1850 water works were projected and put in successful operation. Dr. Sinnet and a few other leading citizens were
influential in getting these established, and thus giving the town the advantage of the purest of spring water. The water was
brought from a spring on the farm of Colonel Woods, two miles northwest of town, and conveyed in earthen pipes to a
reservoir near the "Sugar Loaf," a conical hill in the western suburbs of the town. From here it is distributed over the town,
wherever wanted, in pipes. Those who use the water pay a rental of five dollars a year for an ordinary family.</P>

<P>The company that carried these works forward to completion was known as the "Granville Hydraulic company." As an
investment, in a financial view, it did not pay, and probably its projectors thought less of making money out of it than of
furnishing the inhabitants with pure water. April 13, 1860, the company sold out to Mr. Sanford for two hundred and
thirty-four dollars; subsequently Mr. Sanford died and willed the works to the town, one of the conditions being that the
town should pay to the Episcopal church one hundred dollars per annum.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>One of the woollen factories, mentioned by Mr. Wing, stood about one and one-fourth miles below Granville on Raccoon
creek, and was destroyed by fire about 1840. Another building was erected and used as a woollen factory until 1856.
Subsequently, about 1857, Noah Clouse established the present machine shop in this building. . The firm is Noah Clouse &amp;
Son, and they have conducted this business successfully to the, present time.</P>

<P>Granville, however, lays no claim to being an unusual manufacturing or business place. There are several manufacturing
establishments within the limits of the place, among which are the marble works, the planing mills of Jones Brothers and of
Pratt Brothers. Both these firms make and deal largely in furniture. There are three dry goods stores, kept by George
Parsons, Henry Green, and Mr. Craig; two grocery stores, kept by Carter S Carter and H. L. Reed; one drug store, kept by
Charles Bryant; one hardware store, kept by Jones Brothers; two banks, one national and one private; two newspapers, two
hotels, and the usual number of smaller establishments. The trades and professions are also well represented. It does not
appear that it is money and business that these people are living for; the whole community is deeply religious, highly
