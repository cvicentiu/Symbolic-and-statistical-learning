Science is really two books in one-a science book that contains important science information and a listening book that stretches skills in hearing and following directions. While children are learning to listen and follow directions, they will also be learning some significant science material, including phases of the moon, parts of a flower and the functions of different parts of the brain. You'll have children writing, drawing, measuring, coloring, even jumping up and down as they learn to listen-and listen to learn. You'll also find pretests and posttests, a chart for measuring progress and an answer key. Most of the activities require only paper and pencil, for others handy reproducible pages are included. The book covers: Seasons and the Weather Space The Human Body Nutrition, Health and Safety Plants Animals And if that were not enough, it is also fun :)  For K-3. ISBN: 1573100218. Soft Cover.
