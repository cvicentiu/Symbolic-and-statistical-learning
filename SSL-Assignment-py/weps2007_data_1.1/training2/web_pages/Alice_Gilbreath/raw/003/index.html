<p>The Ladies of the Maccabees of the World were organized in Rainier on July 17, 1897.
They met in the little, all-useful store building of Dean Blanchard, on what is now the
corner at East Fifth and A streets, effected their organization and elected officers. </p>

<p>The first officers from this charter list were: Mrs. Victoria A. Perry, past lady
commander; Mrs. Edith E. Clark, lady commander; Mrs. Emily Dryden, lady lieutenant
commander; Miss Anna Belle Perry, lady record keeper; Mrs. Alice Gilbreath, lady Finance
keeper; Mrs. Veronica Herman, lady chaplain; Mrs. Etta Huycke, lady at arms; Miss Hollis
Shatto, lady sergeant, Mrs. Mary J. Pomeroy, lady sentinel; Mrs. Julia M. Both, lady
picket. According to the record that I have, Miss Caroline E. Pomeroy was the only member
of the charter list who was not an officer. </p>

<p>This organization since then has been changed to the Women's Benefit Association of
Maccabees. Its review, number 20, is still an active organization in Rainier. </p>

<p>In the following year, Ivy Camp 373, Woodmen of the World, was instituted. The charter
list for this lodge consisted of: Charles A. Burch, George Buckbee, C.L. Clark, A.L.
Clark, W.J. Deitz, W.H. Dryden, Philip Drouth, H.L. Groves, R.G. Johnson, James Jesse,
E.A. James, G.W. Gordon, S.H. Kistner, A.B. Little, W.E. Newsom, C.C. Pritchard, Thomas
Patton, E.H. Philbrook, A. Parker, G.A. Riggs, W.M. Riggs, J.A. Schunesen, J. Cy Smith,
F.J. Sundblom, J.J. Schmidt. </p>

<p>The charter was granted on February 22, 1898, with officers as follows: Consul, T.H.
Woodruff; escort, W.H. Dryden; advisor, S.H. Kistner; watchman, A.A. Johnson; banker, J.R.
Caldwell; sentry, C.F. Willis; clerk, J. Cy Smith; physician, A.P. McLaren; managers, E.A.
Anfys, Philip Drout, W.J. Deitz. </p>

<p>Women of Woodcraft, Riverside Circle 315, was instituted on November 21,1900. This is
an auxiliary to the Woodmen of the World. The charter officers were: Annie Schunesen,
adviser; Margaret G. Aaron, magician; Flora G. Marquit, past guardian neighbor; George B.
Hallin, clerk; Flora J. Shelton, attendant; Emily A. Dryden, inner sentinel; Nannie B.
Goff, guardian neighbor; Evelyn E. Woodruff, banker; Mrs. Burt Deitz, captain of the
guards; Dr. M.K. Hall, outer sentinel; managers, Emma F. Spinney, Nina B. Haggin, Alta M.
Lee. </p>

<p>Following the &quot;Woodmen of the World and Riverside Circle&quot;, the Odd Fellows
lodge was next in Rainier. </p>

<p>Lodge 151, I.O.O.F., was instituted on March 2, 1901, following a dispensation granted
on February 23 of the same year. The charter list was small, containing but six names:
J.J. Schmidt, W.J. Deitz, Rosswell R. Patch, U.C. Adams, L.E. Clark, S.C. Rich. Though its
beginning was small, the Odd Fellows lodge has grown to the place where it is now one of
the largest lodges in Rainier. </p>

<p>On May 19, 1904, Fern Rebekah Lodge 133 was instituted, with eleven charter
petitioners: W.C. Fischer, Wm. Symons, Lewis Brant, R.H. Mitchell, A.L. Clark, G.A.
Taggert, Eva Brant, Mary J. Clark, Edith E. Clark, Emily Mitchell, Eleanor Symons. </p>

<p>Columbia Encampment 89, another branch of the Odd Fellows lodge, was instituted on May
22, 1923, with 20 members, and, on December 23 of the same year, Columbia Canton 19 was
instituted with 15 members. </p>

<p>Of the later lodges, the Moose lodge is the newest in Rainier. Lodge 1435, L.O.O.M.,
was instituted October 8, 1913, with a charter list of fifty members--the largest by far
of any lodge previously launched in Rainier. This list is as follows: Lee Clark, Fred
Benjamin, R. Touzel, C.F. Tucker, C. Crawford, John Larson, A. Burke, L.E. Clark, C.C.
Fowler. W.B. Smith, W.C. Parker, Harry C. Smith, P.C. Evans, Andrew Lee, Ray Elbon, C.A.
Nutt, Charles Hallirian, Vic Frirer, E.J. Remy, G.B. Graham, W. Oberg, C.M. Fowler,
Charles Rainer, Miles Sheerin. W.A. Rader, W. Curran, C.A. Parker, C.T. Bross, E.O.
Brough, Joseph Keeley, Harry L. Elbon, George Anderson, John Mauris, John Orn, P. Leallen,
S. Styke, C. Murphy, George Weaver, John Kinamas, Frank Sherwood, William Mauris, O.
Nelson, F.M. McDonald, H.S. Schroeder, W.E. Welch, Eric Wilson, Walter Hunter, E.S.
Cochran, J.R. Nutbrown, Thomas Hunter. </p>

<p>The Moose lodge lost its charter in the fire on the morning of June 28.1924, and
another was issued on July 18, of the same year. </p>

<p>Women of Mooseheart Chapter 90 was instituted in Rainier on May 28, 1923. This is the
latest of the lodge additions. </p>

<p>It is safe to say that Rainier almost never was without a lodge, for the Masonic lodge
came here in 1858, which was but a very few years after the opening chapters of Rainier's
known history started. Following that time, of course, the Masonic lodge was the only one
until 1893, so far as any record goes that I have had access to, but after that time the
lodges came in rapid succession. It is rather doubtful if there are many towns of the size
of Rainier where there is such a large lodge membership as there is here. </p>
