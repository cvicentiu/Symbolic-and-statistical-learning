Mr. Popper was a house painter by trade, however he was also a 
daydreamer.  He always read about faraway places. He was quite fascinated 
by the South Pole expedition. He wrote to the explorer, Admiral Drake, 
telling him how he loved reading about the admiral's expedition with 
penguins.  In return the admiral sent him a penguin, and it changed the 
family's life. Mr. Popper's children were thrilled, but his wife didn't 
quite feel the same.
<P>
The penguin, named Captain Cook, grew very sad. Soon another 
penguin arrived and several babies followed. The Popper's need for money 
to support both families led Mr. Popper to put the penguins on the stage. 
Of course the penguins were a big hit and they toured the country. The 
antics that follow will delight all readers!
