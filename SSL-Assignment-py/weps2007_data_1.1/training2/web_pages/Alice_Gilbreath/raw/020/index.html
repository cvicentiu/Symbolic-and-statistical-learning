ACTIVITIES/ART/GAMES<br>
1.  -Children are grouped into 3's in a set of circles.  They are penguins on<br>
icebergs.<br>
     -Other children are placed outside the circles.<br>
     -At the sound of a whistle, all children in the circles must change into<br>
different "icebergs."  The penguins on the outside try to secure a position<br>
on an iceberg, but there can never be more than three penguins on one<br>
iceberg.  These restrictions will require cooperative communication by the<br>
children.<br>
<p>
2.  Use a grocery bag and orange construction paper to turn into a penguin!<br>
 Slit the front of the bag from top to bottom.  Cut a neck hole in the bottom<br>
of the bag.  Cut wing shaped flaps in the sides.  Color the bag black and<br>
white to resemble a penguin.  Form a come from a triangular piece of orange<br>
construction paper.  Staple it together and punch a hole in each side.  Tie a<br>
12 inch piece of string through each hole. Place the cone over your nose like<br>
a beak and tie the strings together at the back of your head.  Now put on the<br>
bag and have a Penguin Parade!  (See chant under SONGS/POEMS)<br>
<p>
3.  Penguins can be made from plastic soda bottles and Styrofoam balls for<br>
heads.  They also can be made from toilet paper rolls.<br>
<p>
4.  Make a life sized igloo from gallon milk jugs stuck together with a glue<br>
gun.<br>
<p>
5.  Bulletin Board:  pass out black and white paper, markers, scissors and<br>
glue.  Kids make penguins.  As a class, create a habitat for the penguins on<br>
the bulletin board.  Attach penguins.<br>
<p>
6.  Penguin Snack:  1 slice of bread per child, spread cream cheese over top.<br>
 Use 1/2 black olives for eyes (or raisins), wedge of carrot for beak,<br>
chopped black olives for wings.<br>
<p>
7.  Make a mini igloo.  Tape or staple an upside down paper bowl (igloo) and<br>
a small paper cup or toilet paper roll (door) to a paper plate.  Spread on a<br>
thin paste made of Ivory soapflakes or detergent and water and let it harden.<br>

        **  Sea lions have long front flippers, external ear flaps and can crawl on<br>
land.  Seals have short flippers with larger claws.  They don't have external<br>
ear flaps and they can't rotate their hips under their bodies to crawl.<br>

        Waddle, waddle, waddle<br>
        From side to side.<br>
        Penguins go a-walking<br>
        Slip, slip, slide.<br>
<p>
        With a funny jump<br>
        The penguins dash<br>
        Down to the water<br>
        Splash! Splash! Splash!<br>
<p>
        Waddle from the water<br>

        Penguins go parading<br>
        On a wintry stroll.<br>

        Oh, it is so cold up north<br>
        Near the Arctic sea!<br>
        Oh......<br>
<p>
        Polar bear, polar bear,<br>

        Watch out for polar bears! (REPEAT)<br>

        PENGUIN IN A STORM<br>
        One little penguin,<br>
        Sitting in the snow.<br>
        He should have been somewhere<br>
        But where he didn't know.<br>
<p>
        Down came the snowflakes,<br>
        Down came the sleet.<br>
        The poor little penguin sat<br>
        Looking at his feet.<br>
<p>
        "Coin!" said the penguin.<br>
        "Coin!" said his mom.<br>
        "Oh!" said the penguin,<br>
        That means COME!<br>
<p>
        Using a large area such as a gym, the students can act out the story above<br>
as the teacher reads it.  At the end, students can huddle together for a hug.<br>
 Discuss that penguins huddle for warmth.  The center of the huddle is at<br>
least 10 degrees warmer than the edge.  As a penguin at the outside gets<br>
cold, he wiggles his way to the center to warm up.  Also discuss that<br>
penguins recognize family members by<br>
the sounds of their voices.<br>
<p>
        I KNOW A LITTLE PENGUIN (to the tune of "I'm a Little Teapot")<br>
        I know a little penguin<br>
        Who sat on some blocks,<br>
        He swam in the ocean<br>
        And he climbed on some rocks!<br>
<p>
        He snapped at a seagull,<br>
        He snapped at a seal,<br>
        He snapped at a fish,<br>
        Oh, what a meal!<br>
<p>
        ON TOP OF AN ICEBERG (to the tune of "On Top of Old Smoky")<br>
        On top of an iceberg,<br>
        All covered with snow,<br>
        I saw my first penguin<br>
        And I wanted to know.<br>
<p>
        Oh is it a bird,<br>
        Or is it a fish?<br>
        I looked at his feathers,<br>
        And knew which was which.<br>
<p>
        I said, "Mr. Penguin,<br>
        Which species are you?"<br>
        He said, "I'm an emperor,<br>
        And not a gentoo."<br>
<p>
        I said, "Mr. Penguin,<br>
        What's under you patch?"<br>
        He said, "It's an egg,<br>
        It's ready to hatch!"<br>
<p>
        I said, "Mr. Penguin,<br>
        Oh, where is your wife?"<br>
        "She's out in the ocean,<br>
        She'll be back tonight."<br>
<p>
        Said Mr. Penguin,<br>
        "Her name is Jill.<br>
        She's out in the ocean,<br>
        Feeding on krill."<br>
<p>
        The next thing I knew,<br>
        I heard a small peep.<br>
        And I saw a chick,<br>
        At the emperor's feet!<br>
<p>
        I'M A LITTLE PENGUIN (to the tune of "I'm a Little Teapot")<br>
        I'm a little penguin<br>
        Round and fat<br>
        Here is my beak<br>
        Here is my hat.<br>
<p>
        Winter days are coming,<br>
        Hear me shout,<br>
        "Please don't toss<br>
        My mittens out!"<br>
<p>
        OR<br>
<p>
        I'm a little penguin,<br>
        Black and white.<br>
        Short and wobbly,<br>
        An adorable sight.<br>
<p>
        I can't fly at all,<br>
        but I love to swim.<br>
        So I'll waddle to the water<br>
        And dive right in!<br>
<p>
        THREE LITTLE PENGUINS<br>
        Three little penguins, dressed in white and black.<br>
        Waddle, waddle forward and waddle right back!<br>
<p>
        Three little penguins, in a funny pose,<br>
        They are wearing their evening clothes.<br>
<p>
        Their suits are black and their vests are white.<br>
        They waddle to the left and they waddle to the right.<br>
<p>
        They stand on the ice and they look very neat,<br>
        As they waddle along on their little flat feet.<br>
<p>
        Six little penguins off an iceberg did dive,<br>
        One bumped his beak, then there were five.<br>
<p>
        Five little penguins swam the ocean floor,<br>
        One saw a whale, then there were four.<br>
<p>
        Four little penguins spun around, whee-ee!<br>
        One spun off, then there were three!<br>
<p>
        Three little penguins, with nothing to do,<br>
        One went fishing, then there were two.<br>
<p>
        Two little penguins, having lots of fun,<br>
        One fell of, then there was one.<br>
<p>
        One little penguin, when the day was done,<br>
        Went home to sleep, then there were none.<br>

ACTIVITIES/ART/GAMES<br>
1.  Snow Jar:  Cover inside of baby food jar lid with hot wax (adult).  Place<br>
small plastic snowmen and trees on the wax.  Let dry over night.  Fill jar<br>
3/4 full with water.  Add 1 Tablespoon white glitter.  Attach lid and seal<br>
with epoxy glue (adult).<br>
2.  Animal Tracks:  Cut track shape with a sponge, dip in cornstarch make<br>
tracks in room before children enter.  When children arrive, they describe<br>
(written) the animal that left the tracks and draw a picture.<br>
3.  Animal Tracks:  Kids make tracks with hands, fists, and fingertips dipped<br>
in paint.  A fist print with fingerprint toes makes a great track.  Children<br>
can write about and draw the full sized animal that made the tracks.<br>
4.  Animal Tracks Bulletin Board:  Make "tracks" with childrens' feet.  Paint<br>
 each child's foot or feet and have them make a footprint on white paper.<br>
 Write each child's name under their "tracks."  Cover the name with a flap.<br>
 Attach all of the "tracks" to a bulletin board or wall with the heading<br>
"Whose Tracks Are These?"<br>
5.  Snow:  Check into your local ice rink.  When the Zamboni scrapes the ice,<br>
it makes "snow."  Visit the ice rink to see the snow pile or ask about a<br>
contest to win a yardful of snow!!<br>

The bushes look like popcorn balls.<br>
And places where I always play,<br>
Look like somewhere else today.<br>
