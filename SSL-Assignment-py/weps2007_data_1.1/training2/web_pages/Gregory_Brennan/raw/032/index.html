                    Mychal Judge was born in Brooklyn to Irish immigrant parents. 
                    His father died when he was 6 years old after having been 
                    hospitalized for more than three years. &#147;I never called

                    my own.&#148; His parents ran a boardinghouse and after his 
                    father&#146;s death, his mother, his two sisters (one of them 
                    is his twin) and Fr. Mychal lived there. He handled much of 
                    the handyman tasks for their house. &#147;Although we had 
                    nothing, my mother made us feel like we were upper middle 
                    class.&#148; His sisters are both widows now and he has &#147;a 
                    tremendous relationship with them.&#148; He lived in Brooklyn 
                    but traveled frequently to Manhattan to shine shoes at Grand 
                    Central Station and Penn Station. &quot;I was always hustling.&quot;

                    else in the world would you go? I remember the lower church 
                    and the fountain and a friar. I loved him and his brown robe. 
                    I used to follow him around everywhere. I knew then that I 
                    wanted to be a friar.&#148; He entered the seminary at 15 
                    and has been a priest for 40 years. He was called. &#147;I 
                    felt a tremendous urge to be a priest and answered &#147;yes.&#148;

                    California for a drug offense. Tim wrote to Fr. Mychal and 
                    asked him to write back and, if possible, to send a few dollars 
                    since he cannot earn money in prison. Fr. Mychal began to 
                    write to him regularly. Tim&#146;s family abandoned him and 
                    he has been incarcerated for three years without any visitors 
                    or letters from home. Now he faces an additional six years 
                    in a federal prison. A priest friend of Fr. Mychal also lives

                    Fr. Mychal was given a free airline ticket to travel anywhere 
                    in the U.S. &#147;I thought I could use that ticket to visit 
                    Tim.&#148; He made arrangements to fly to California and stay 
                    with his friend and visit Tim. He flew to the West Coast and 
                    stayed overnight and drove the next morning to the prison. 
                    He arranged in advance for permission to meet Tim but when 
                    he arrived, it was pouring rain and he couldn&#146;t find 
                    a parking place. When he finally parked, he was 15 minutes 
                    past the scheduled time and was denied admission.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fr. Mychal 
                    pleaded to be admitted and the official finally consented. 
                    Tim was not told that a guest was scheduled. The room where 
                    prisoners and guests meet is divided by a glass partition 
                    and they are not allowed to touch each other. &#147;While 
                    I waited, I prayed, &#145;Lord, let this visit go well, take 
                    care of him. Let Your will be done in our lives,&#146; When 
                    Tim entered and saw me, the most beautiful smile came over 
                    his face. He said, &#145;What are you doing here? I&#146;ve 
                    never had a visitor.&#146; So we sat and I listened for an 
                    hour and a half, then I blessed him and left. I was so grateful. 
                    You can&#146;t prepare for a visit like this. You just stand 
                    there and let it happen and the words will come.&#148;</font><font size="5">

                    &#145;yes&#146; often means responding affirmatively to those 
                    who need help. It means giving support. I don&#146;t know

                    someone who is suffering anything in particular. I just empathize 
                    with them and encourage them to find a solution in dealing 
                    with their situation. I pray &#145;Lord, show me, show them, 
                    what to do. I&#146;m asking for Your will to be done in our 
                    lives. Please, help. I love You, I trust You, I believe in

                    has to come. And maybe a few days later the person will become 
                    a little stronger and take a few steps to improve their situation 
                    and someone somewhere says something that they hear and it 
                    stays with them. That&#146;s how God works with you. God&#146;s 
                    grace can touch a person and change their life. It takes courage 
                    and faith. We are all filled with fears but the Lord is there 
                    to relieve you of your fears.&#148;</font></p>

                    bedside of injured firefighters. &#147;You could work at this 
                    24 hours a day ministering to the firefighters and their families. 
                    It&#146;s endless. There is so much work to do. They have 
                    very stressful jobs. As much as I can I talk with them. That 
                    way I learn to hear them, and listen to their anxieties and 
                    fears, and how they deal or don&#146;t deal with those fears. 
                    And how I can help them. For example, one day while I was 
                    filling in for Fr. Julian, I received a phone call that a 
                    lieutenant was killed by a falling tree on an upstate highway. 
                    I was accompanied by his fellow officers and went to break 
                    the news to his wife. She sat in a chair and I knelt next 
                    to her. She asked me if there was any chance if he was killed 
                    by a tree because &#145;I passed a car accident this afternoon 
                    on the highway but I didn&#146;t stop to look.&#146; What 
                    could I say? It was very hard that time and it&#146;s hard

                    His story is absolutely extraordinary. It is definitely God&#146;s

                    walk away. But when we accept it and say &#145;yes&#146; and 
                    go forward, great and wonderful things will happen. It takes

                    was home and received a phone call from officer Steven McDonald 
                    asking me whether I heard about the crash of TWA Flight 800 
                    on Long Island. He told me that the families were meeting 
                    at a hotel at the airport. &#145;Are you going? I think you 
                    should.&#146; So I left immediately and drove out to the hotel. 
                    I went as a chaplain and a priest. People were gathering and 
                    Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was trying to help them with a manifest 
                    to inquire whether their loved ones were on the plane. I stood 
                    next to him and began to move with him from table to table. 
                    Then I went home and returned the next day and said Mass. 
                    We sat and waited for 16 days for the bodies to be found. 
                    During that time I got to know these people and went to the 
                    funerals for their loved ones.&#148; Who among us would want 
                    to wait 16 days for washed-up bodies? Who would want to comfort 
                    the grieving? Fr. Mychal goes where most people wouldn&#146;t 
                    go for a million dollars. And he does it again and again and 
                    again.<br>
                    Fr. Mychal often walks right into the middle of a catastrophe 
                    - the kind of chaos that would cause most people to run the 
                    other way. He goes into devastation and comforts the injured 
                    and grieving people without knowing anyone there. He walks 
                    into chaos and begins to minister without an invitation. &#147;I 
                    don&#146;t think about it, I just do it. I walk right in, 
                    hold a hand, wipe a tear and say a prayer. That&#146;s not 
                    me, Mychal Judge. That&#146;s the grace of God. I don&#146;t 
                    worry about the details or arrangements. It&#146;s a mystery.

                  to whatever God asks even when Fr. Mychal has no idea of where 
                  he will go or what he will do or say. He simply places his trust 
                  in God and let&#146;s God&#146;s will be done. The next time 
                  you hear the sirens of a fire truck, think of Fr. Mychal as 
                  he accompanies the firefighters into the next tragedy, heading 
                  straight for the flames and confusion, offering himself as God&#146;s 
                  instrument to comfort the injured and the dying.</font></td>
