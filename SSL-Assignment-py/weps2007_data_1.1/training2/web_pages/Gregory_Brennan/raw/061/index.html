<!-- PRESENTATION: Linux Clusters -->
<dt><strong>November 26, 2001, <a name="linuxclusters">Linux Clusters</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:lindahl@conservativecomputer.com">Greg Lindahl</a> on
Linux Clustering.
</p><p>
Clusters come in 3 different flavors: high performance, high throughput,
and high availability.  Linux is used for all 3 kinds of clustering, in
quite large systems.  Examples include the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/highlights.html">Google search engine</a>, <a href="http://www.incyte.com/company/news/webcast/slides/sld006.htm">Incyte Genomics</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/cplant/">Sandia's CPlant</a>, each of which
uses more than 2,000 cpus. This talk will discuss the software behind
such systems.

</p><p> A <a href="linuxcluster.pdf">PDF file of the slides</a> (154k) is available.

<!-- PRESENTATION: CGI/Database Development with HTML:Mason  -->
<dt><strong>September 24, 2001, <a name="htmlmason">CGI/Database Development with HTML:Mason </a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:shipwright@firstva.com">Gregory Brennan</a> on
using <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML:Mason</a> instead of "raw"
perl for CGI/Database Development.

<!-- PRESENTATION: An Introduction to Parallel Computing with PETSc -->
<dt><strong>August 27, 2001, <a name="petsc">An Introduction to Parallel Computing with PETSc</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:bemays@virginia.edu">Brian Mays</a> on
parallel computing with the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
Computation (<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc">PETSc</a>).  This toolkit
eases the development of large-scale scientific application codes,
particularly the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs).  It provides a rich environment for rapid algorithm design and
prototyping and separates the issues of parallelism from the choice of
algorithms.  This talk will include an example of using PETSc to build a
parallel code for the solution of a nonlinear PDE.

</p><p> A <a href="petsc.pdf">PDF file of the slides</a> (128k) is available.

<!-- PRESENTATION: Mac OS X -->
<dt><strong>July 23, 2001, <a name="macosx1">Mac OS X</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:adavis@apple.com">Aaron Davis</a> and
<a href="mailto:scottmcdowell@apple.com">Scott McDowell</a> on
Apple's latest operating system: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.  The core of this new operating system
is the open-source, BSD-based operating system developed at Apple called
<a href="http://www.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a>.  Therefore, OS X combines
the power of a Unix-based operating system, the advantages of an
open-source project, and the ease-of-use traditionally associated with
Apple and the Macintosh.

</p></dd>
<!-- PRESENTATION: CVS -->
<dt><strong>April 23, 2001, <a name="cvs">CVS</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:adrian@ubergeeks.com">Adrian Filipi-Martin</a> on
the Concurrent Versions System (CVS).  CVS is a version control system,
which allows one to keep old versions of files (usually source code),
keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred.  Unlike simpler
systems, such as RCS or SCCS, CVS does not just operate on one file
at a time or one directory at a time, but operates on hierarchical
collections of directories consisting of version controlled files.

</p><p> A <a href="cvs-talk.pdf">PDF file of the slides</a> (28k) is available.

<!-- PRESENTATION: IPv6 -->
<dt><strong>March 26, 2001, <a name="ipv6">IPv6</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:serge@guanotronic.com">Serge Egelman</a> on
<a href="http://www.ipv6.org">IPv6</a>.
IPv6 is short for "Internet Protocol Version 6". IPv6 is the "next
generation" protocol designed by the IETF to replace the current version
Internet Protocol, IP Version 4 ("IPv4"), which is now nearly twenty
years old and is beginning to have problems.  Most importantly, there is
a growing shortage of IPv4 addresses.  IPv6 fixes a number of problems
in IPv4, such as the limited number of available IPv4 addresses.  His
presentation included the basics of IPv6 addresses, and how to get
started using this new protocol.  Since IPv4 is still the standard
used by almost everyone, he also covered how to tunnel IPv6 over IPv4
networks.

<!-- PRESENTATION: Mac OS X -->
<dt><strong>January 22, 2001, <a name="macosx">Mac OS X</a></strong></dt><dd>
<p>A talk presented by <a href="mailto:serge@guanotronic.com">Serge Egelman</a> on
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.
His presentation included a demonstration of the developer pre-release
of the new BSD-based operating system from Apple.
