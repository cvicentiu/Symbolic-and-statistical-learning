                    Chaplain&#146;s Seminar and First Meeting Rochester, New York, 
                    August 16, 1966<br>
                    </b><br>
                    The meeting was called to order at 8:05 p.m. with prayer by 
                    the Rev. Robert C. Field, Chaplain of FASNY. Father Field&#146;s 
                    opening remarks involved the longtime question, &#147;What 
                    is the purpose of a Fire Department Chaplain?&#148; After 
                    some discussion by those present, Father Field suggested that 
                    we might hold a midwinter meeting and unify our stand on this 
                    matter. He then introduced the keynote speaker of the evening, 
                    Father Vincent A. Kennedy of Wantagh, New York.<br>
                    <br>
                    Father Kennedy began his talk by challenging all present, 
                    &#147;We all, as Fire Chaplains, have a serious job to do.&#148; 
                    He went on to say, &#147;When the call goes out for the Chaplain, 
                    it is important to firemen to know that their Chaplain is 
                    there. Even when illness strikes, men of the department like 
                    to have their Chaplain call, especially during serious illness. 
                    During my eighteen (18) years experience as a Chaplain (responding 
                    to fires, plane crashes and other emergencies), I have come 
                    to realize the important role the Chaplain plays in the lives 
                    of firemen and people caught in tragedy.&#148; Our speaker 
                    continued, &#147;This is a historical moment in the history 
                    of New York State as we of different faiths gather here as 
                    brother firemen&#133;We need to get to know each other, see 
                    eye to eye, clarify our standards. We are not Chaplains for 
                    ourselves but for God...we are sometimes the only link between 
                    firemen and God.&#148;<br>
                    <br>
                    Serious discussion followed Father Kennedy&#146;s talk and 
                    it was pointed out that we have no central bureau for Fire 
                    Chaplains and no reference as to procedure or standardization. 
                    Several important questions were raised: (1) Should our Chaplains 
                    be trained? (2) What really is the Chaplain&#146;s role? (3) 
                    How many Ordained and Lay Chaplains do we have? (4) Should 
                    we organize? It was agreed, that only by future meetings and 
                    discussions, could we attempt to answer these important questions. 
                    It was also agreed that to better inform Fire Chaplains of 
                    their duties, a source of such information should be available.<br>
                    <br>
                    By the consent of all present, it was agreed to organize on 
                    a state-wise level; including both clergy and laymen. Father 
                    Field then suggested that we elect officers so we can have 
                    a group to move the organization ahead. He moved that Father 
                    Kennedy be made President, Reverend John Brown, Vice President 
                    and Reverend Robert Bromfield, Secretary; he himself, would 
                    act as an advisor. His motion was seconded, carried and these 
                    men were elected. The question of how we should organize was 
                    raised and Father Field stated that, &#147;there is a possibility 
                    of organizing under the auspices of the Firemen&#146;s Association 
                    of the State of New York; if this is not possible we can organize 
                    as an independent group.&#148;<br>
                    <br>
                    Father Weis made a motion that we send a questionnaire to 
                    all fire companies in regard to their Chaplains (procedures, 
                    programs, uniforms, etc). His motion was seconded and carried. 
                    Father Steger suggested that we ask each company what type 
                    of Chaplain they have, ordained or lay. It was agreed to include 
                    this on the questionnaire.<br>
                    <br>
                    Father Kennedy thanked the group for electing him to his important 
                    position and he pledged himself to creating an organization 
                    of dedicated Chaplains throughout New York State. As suggested, 
                    a midwinter meeting will be arranged by the officers at a 
                    time most convenient to all involved.<br>
                    <br>
                    The meeting was adjourned at 9:50 p.m. with prayer by Reverend 
                    Brown. Fourteen (14) Chaplains were present.<br>

                    <br>
                    The New York State Association of Fire Chaplains, Inc. is 
                    an association uniting Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish 
                    Chaplains, whether lay or ordained, in the fire service. Through 
                    meetings, it provides fellowship, develops ideas and procedures 
                    for Chaplains to follow in ministry and gives opportunities 
                    to develop skills in firematics through annual training periods.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through the support of the Firemen&#146;s Association of the 
                    State of New York and during the Annual Meeting, a seminar 
                    of fourteen Chaplains under the direction of Chaplain Robert 
                    Field, then Chaplain of F.A.S.N.Y., took place in Rochester, 
                    NY on August 16, 1966.<br>
                    <br>
                    The purpose of the founding seminar was nine-fold in its inquiry: 
                    1. General duties and responsibilities of Chaplains of fire 
                    departments and companies and other organizations; 2. Duties 
                    and responsibilities of the Chaplain at a fire; 3. Suggestions 
                    for a local Annual Memorial Service for departed firemen; 
                    4. Conduct of a service at a wake in a funeral home; 5. Blessing 
                    and dedication of a new fire house; 6. Blessing of a new fire 
                    truck and/or other equipment; 7. Prayers to be used on special 
                    occasions; 8. Means of interesting more clergy to participate 
                    in the work of the volunteers; 9. General knowledge of and 
                    how to use if necessary Scott airpack and other pieces of 
                    equipment.<br>
                    <br>
                    During this successful meeting, it was decided that a committee 
                    should be formed to seek means of formally organizing a fire 
                    department Chaplains&#146; Association. This committee met 
                    periodically in 1966 and 1967 and presented to interested 
                    Chaplains a constitution and by-laws paper. Of general interest 
                    to firefighters is the stated purpose of the Association which 
                    reads: &#147;The purpose of this Association is to unite all 
                    fire Chaplains of the State of New York in order to promote 
                    a deeper and wider knowledge of one another in the true ecumenical 
                    spirit and to establish statewide procedures of standardization 
                    in serving our firemen and God, our supreme Chief.&#148;<br>
                    <br>
                    Thus fourteen Chaplains, becoming the charter members, formed 
                    the New York State Association of Fire Chaplains, Inc. With 
                    the appropriate papers drawn up, the constitution and by-laws 
                    agreed upon, the Association presented the formal incorporation 
                    papers to the State of New York on May 12, 1967. A supreme 
                    court justice signed the papers on June 1, 1967, thereby legally 
                    recognizing the New York State Association of Fire Chaplains 
                    as a duly constituted and incorporated nonprofit, educational, 
                    religious body.<br>
                    <br>
                    The by-laws require the election of certain officers for the 
                    Association. These are Chief Chaplain, 1st Deputy Chief Chaplain, 
                    2nd Deputy Chief Chaplain, Executive Secretary and a Board 
                    of Directors. The first officers elected were: The Rev. Vincent 
                    A. Kennedy, Wantagh, NY, Chief Chaplain; the Rev. John L. 
                    Brown, then of Jordan, NY, 1st Deputy Chief Chaplain; the 
                    Rev. David W. Arnold, New City, NY, 2nd Deputy Chief Chaplain; 
                    the Rev. Robert A. Bromfield, Marcy, NY, Secretary-Treasurer. 
                    The Board of Directors were; the Rev. Robert Field, Mr. Edward 
                    J. Sitzman; the Rev. Richard K. Much; Mr. James Reitz, Sr.; 
                    the Rev. John J. Steger; and Mr. Harold D. Robbie.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Association held two meetings per year in January and 
                    in May. The spring meeting was for actual firematic training 
                    and the winter meeting was given over to discussions, panels 
                    or papers concerning the work of the fire department Chaplain. 
                    In 1982, it was decided to hold one spring meeting each year. 
                    In the early years, financial support came from the gifts 
                    of Fire Departments within the state. These gifts were placed 
                    in a special fund with the hope that some day we could establish 
                    a central office.<br>
                    <br>
                    A manual was developed containing the Constitution and By-laws, 
                    an article on The Role of the Fire Chaplain, funeral and memorial 
                    services and prayers for various occasions. In 1976, out-of-state 
                    Chaplains were granted an associate membership.<br>
                    <br>
                    November 6-7, 1976, the tenth anniversary celebration took 
                    place at Skaneateles, NY. The highlight of the program was 
                    the presentation of a proclamation by New York State Governor 
                    Hugh L. Carey; recognizing the tenth anniversary of the Association 
                    and proclaiming November 7, 1976 as Fire Chaplain Day in New 
                    York State. From its inception through the tenth anniversary, 
                    the Association was the only known one of its kind in the 
                    world.<br>
                    <br>
                    As of 1985, the Association had grown to over 400 members. 
                    The organization has membership in The Firemen&#146;s Association 
                    of the State of New York (F.A.S.N.Y.) and the Fellowship of 
                    Fire Chaplains, an international group. The Association has 
                    developed its own permanent seal and coat badge. Many of the 
                    Chaplains wear the uniforms of their respective departments. 
                    The Association provides manuals, badges, shoulder patches, 
                    helmet decals, windshield decals, name badges, membership 
                    brochures and sends out a newsletter twice a year, in addition 
                    to the minutes of the annual meeting. Also available for loan 
                    from the office of the Executive Secretary are two slide presentations: 
                    &#147;The Church Fire&#148; and &#147;The Role of the Fire 
                    Chaplain in the volunteer fire service.&#148;</font></p>

                    List of Charter Members</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Due to the fact that the early records do not have full information 
                    on the attendance of Fire Chaplains, the following list contains 
                    the names of those who we suppose were the fourteen charter 
                    members. If a full list is ever discovered, we will add to 
                    this list. Those Chaplains listed below with an asterisk before 
                    their names are definitely charter members. They can be verified 
                    by testimony as to their presence or by the minutes of the 
                    August 16, 1966 organizational meeting.<br>
