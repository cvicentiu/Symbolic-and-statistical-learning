Since 1967 the Company has fulfilled this mission and purpose on a continuing basis.   Building a performing arts venue is an extension of this mission and purpose.  The Company is a non profit 501(c)3 Public Benefit Corporation.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effort is currently focused on the Federal Building, 823 Marin Street, Vallejo, CA, built in 1933 under the WPA (Worker&#146; Progress Administration which was formed to put people to work during the Great Depression).  The building was auctioned on the General Services Administration Property Disposal website.  The Company entered the bidding process December 30, 2002 and on January 27, 2003 was successful in winning the bidding procedure to purchase the building.  Being successful, the Company is now developing a phased Capital Campaign fund to secure financing to cover the $532,222 cost.  Phase I of the Capital Campaign will raise $532,222 through donations and loans; Phase II of the Capital Campaign will raise the approximate $4.1 million to renovate the building.  It is estimated it will take up to five years to complete the project.		<p><u>Building Description </u>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building, made of large cement blocks, is very solid and has 15,183 square feet, with approximately 10,100 square feet on the first floor and 5,000 square feet in the basement.  There are no fractures from earthquakes that have taken place over the years; however, earthquake retrofitting is necessary to comply with local codes for public use of the building.  The ceilings are 25&#146; high, lending the building to eventually developing and installing a full-height fly system and adequate theater lighting system.  Retrofitting costs will be reduced considerably as the proposed redesign of the building will include portions of the theater installation as part of the retrofitting (removing all of the walls, ceilings, chasers, etc. that would have to be otherwise anchored).  		<p><u>Proposed Changes to Building </u>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed that the historical features of the building will be maintained and restored; a 300 seat, full service theater and a 50 seat, black box theater will be built behind the historical areas of the building (mostly within the lobby area); and a multiple use area including a book store, gallery, costume museum and coffee cart in the lobby area (not impinging upon, but enhancing the historical portions).  In the basement it is proposed that there will be income producing opportunities including Combs&#146; Costume Closet, a costume shop for costume construction and rentals; storage spaces for the Vallejo Naval &amp; Historical Museum and an office for the Public Access TV.		<p><u>Performance Venues Currently Available in Vallejo</u>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vallejo has a need for more performing arts spaces.  At present there exists venues including, Bay Terrace Theatre (operated by MIRA Theatre Guild), Hogan High School Auditorium (full service 800+ seat theater built in the 1950&#146;s by Federal funds and to be used by the community), Vallejo High School, Jesse Bethel High School, some auditorium/cafeteria stages in several grammar schools (all operated by the Vallejo City Unified School District), the Fetterly Playhouse for the Arts (operated by the Vallejo Community Arts Foundation and partially built out by Vallejo Music Theatre), The Joseph Room at the J. F. K. Library, the Vallejo Naval &amp; Historical Museum, California Maritime Academy (CA University system), Six Flags/Marine World stages (offered periodically to local groups such as the Symphony Orchestra), Owens Theatre (Touro University on Mare Island), the Masonic Temple, the Empress Theatre (privately owned and currently planned for renovation and in development stages for use by performing arts groups) and various churches have some stages.  But for live, full cast theater programs, very few of the above venues are available for periods long enough to rehearse, build sets and in other ways prepare to produce performances.  		<p> Bay Terrace Theatre, a 200-seat house, is the only venue that is solely dedicated to theater with set building and storage capabilities and rehearsal spaces which can be used while a show is in production.  Although MIRA Theatre Guild has sole use of the building, they offer it to other groups to use at relatively reasonable rates when they are not in production.  The Fetterly Playhouse for the Arts is a work in progress.  Two groups are able to rehearse there at one time, but not during the production of a show.  Rehearsal spaces are seriously needed.  An office building with large rooms or a warehouse with partitions could be dedicated to rehearsal spaces for many performing arts groups, thus relieving the actual performing arts venue for performances.		<p> Adding to the mix in the downtown area a new theater with space for set building, rehearsals (while a production is on going) would greatly enhance the revitalization of the area and add to the mix of arts and entertainment; often development of this sort is a key to the revitalization of a city core.		<p><u>Vallejo, A Diverse City</u>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among its claims to fame, Vallejo is one of the most diverse communities in the United States with the following percentages in each ethnic category:  White 30.4%, Black or African American 23.3%, American Indian/Alaskan Native .5%, Asian 23.8%, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders 1%, some other race .3%, two or more races 4.8%, Hispanic or Latino 15.9%.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vallejo is located on San Pablo Bay and is the last city in the Bay Area to revitalize its downtown and improve its waterfront.  Vallejo has suffered economically through the closure of Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  It has a rich cultural heritage, with many ethnic groups represented by their own performing arts groups.  Vallejo is on track to revitalizing its downtown working with Triad Developers as Consultants.  The City lacks enough performing arts spaces in town to accommodate all performing arts groups.  Vallejo Music Theatre strongly believes that a live performing arts venue in the Downtown area will greatly benefit the revitalization effort.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The median household income for Solano County is $46,115 and for California is $39,595.  Vallejo is the largest city in Solano County.  Cost of housing and cost of living is lower in Vallejo than in some other Bay Area counties due to its economic downturn in the 1990&#146;s.  Persons below the poverty level in Solano County is 11.3% in relation to 16.0% overall for California.  Currently there is a move to bring in investors to the downtown area who will renovate, restore old buildings and bring in quality stores, restaurants and services.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vallejo Music Theatre has watched over the last ten years as an Arts and Entertainment District seems to be forming in the Downtown historic district which includes the Vallejo Naval &amp; Historical Museum, Vallejo Artists Guild Gallery, Masonic Building (which rents to performing arts groups) and the revitalization of The Empress Theatre, an old movie house/vaudeville theatre and a city landmark recently purchased by an investor and on the fast track to be retrofitted and turned into a performing arts space and/or theater.  Vallejo Music Theatre proposes to purchase, renovate and install two theaters for live performances into the Federal Building at 823 Marin St., located across the street from the Museum and a block away from the Artist&#146;s Guild Gallery, the Empress and the Masonic Building.  		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federal Building is located in a low to median income area with average age of the homes in the Historic District 80 years.  Ethnic makeup in the area around the building is 48%.  It is on the edge of the Redevelopment District.  It is a prime building for lenders under the Community Reinvestment Act.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mare Island Naval Shipyard, closed in 1991, is being turned into an economic engine for the City of Vallejo by Lennar Mare Island Developers.  Many new businesses and artists have moved to the Island.  Located on the Island is Touro University, a college of Osteopathic Medicine.  Students currently number around 3,000.  Also located on the Island is a Charter School, M.I.T., which has received honors for working with children of diverse ethnicities.  Vallejo has an Architectural Heritage District with many old Victorians, which are gradually being bought by buyers moving from San Francisco seeking a lower cost of living area and who are restoring them.  Vallejo continues to have some of the best low cost housing in the Bay Area.		<p><u>Setting Priorities</u>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first priority has been met by winning the bid for the building through the bidding process.  As the bidding was ongoing, the Company started the Capital Campaign to raise the funds to pay for it.  The second priority, raising the amount of and deadline for the down payment (10% of the final bid, or $53,222), has also been met.		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various avenues are being researched including banks, mortgage companies, pledges, donations, unsecured loans and major events to finalize the purchase.  The Company&#146;s first unsecured loan of $25,000, made by a member of the Board of Directors, allowed the Company to participate in the bidding process.  A fundraising program within the community began in earnest the last week of December, 2002, with two major articles appearing in the Vallejo Times-Herald, letters to past donors mailed before year&#146;s end and a flyer to the entire Company mailing list numbering approximately 4,000.  From this effort (in less than two weeks), $10,000+ was raised and pledges and donations continue to come in.  Offers to hold major fundraising events in the Company&#146;s name have been offered; among them the Suburban Kiwanis who plan to hold a major fundraiser as soon as possible.  In September, 2002, the Company started an income stream through twice-weekly Bingo games for the sole purpose of paying the debt secured for purchase.  The games currently average $4,000+ per month, with the promise of growth in months and years to come.  The current plan is to continue the games, until the debt is paid or contributions equal or exceed Bingo income in order to cancel the debt.  The Company hired a Capital Campaign Director, who started work February 2, 2002.		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible leasers have made commitments; Combs Costume Closet has indicated a willingness to rent spaces for a costume shop at $1,000 a month; the Vallejo Naval &amp; Historical Museum has indicated a willingness to pay up to $100 a month for storage spaces; Harbor Youth Theater of Suisun is looking for rehearsal spaces in Vallejo and has indicated they are willing to pay up to $8,000 per month to rent the building (before it is renovated) three nights a week for classes.  Our income stream, therefore, we anticipate, will be adequate to handle mortgage, insurance and maintenance of the building.		<p><u>Where Do We Go Next?</u>		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the building is in Vallejo Music Theatre&#146;s name the process of raising funds will begin in earnest to repay debt, renovate, install theaters, maintain and manage the building.  Unless and until this happens, many funding sources will not grant funds to the non-profit.  The following is an estimate of the costs (separate and apart from the programming costs and expenses of Vallejo Music Theatre) involved in managing the building.  		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used as our base the financial information for a building approximately 20,000 square feet, operated by a non-profit organization which has been in operation in Vallejo longer than Vallejo Music Theatre.		<p><u>PROPOSED ANNUAL BUDGET WHEN COMPLETED</u>		<p><b>Annual Income</b></td>		<td height=2028></td>	</tr>	<tr valign=top>		<td></td>		<td colspan=2>		<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5>			<tr>				<td height=42 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Ticket Sales Main Theater ($1 per seat per performance from 3 theater companies, Assuming 250 seats for each performance are sold, each company at 20 performances per year)</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$15,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=26 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Ticket Sales Black Box Theatre ($1 per seat per performance for 20 performances)</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$1,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=22 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Bingo (estimate $4,000 per months average)</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$48,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=20 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Grants, donations and challenge grants</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$50,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=21 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Fundraising Events</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$50,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=21 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Gallery, Bookstore, Coffee Shop</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$3,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=21 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Costume Rentals</td>				<td width=75 valign=top>				<p align=right>$1,000</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td height=22 width=345 valign=top>				<p>Other Rentals (possible Museum &amp;

Daniel Archer, an Architect in Mill Valley, has agreed to provide a preliminary Architectural Study pro-bono.  He has all of the drawings and is 		<p>waiting for the go ahead to move forward once the building is in The Company&#146;s hands.  Managing Director, Judith H. Brown, who was among the group instrumental in saving of the Napa Valley 		<p>Opera House in 1986, has contacted Robert Bailey, nationwide Consultant for historic theaters and restoration projects, to work up the Business Plan and Feasibility Study.  The price tag for the full-blown study is $25,500.  The Company has contacted and met with Essex and Drake, fundraisers who raised the money for the San Jose Performing Arts Center.  They are simply waiting for the building to transfer into The Company&#146;s hands and they will provide services to raise $4.1 million dollars for as proposed cost of $40,000..  		<p> Some of the items required for a Business Plan are alluded to in this proposal.  A complete Business Plan will include such categories as Market Study (The Company&#146;s market includes the nine Bay Area Counties and includes Yolo and Placer counties), Trading Area (Solano, Napa, Contra Costa and Sonoma counties), Population Characteristics (diversity figures for Vallejo only are included in this proposal; Solano and Napa counties reflect similar breakdowns), Population Data (income levels, educational levels, etc.), Target Markets, Audience Potential, delineated existing facilities and preliminary architectural plans.  Engineering studies will also be necessary and the Company is currently seeking a structural engineer to work on this part of the project.  Consultation for engineering needs has been offered by a local business person and is being followed up.		<p> All of these studies and plans are necessary to apply for grants and donations from foundations, local, state and federal government funds specified for historic buildings.  		<p> The process to have the building declared on the National Registry of Historic Buildings is ongoing and being followed up by the General Services Administration.		<p><u>Fundraising &amp; Endowment Funds</u> 		<p> Beginning almost immediately fundraising events will be scheduled for large groups of people to attend.  Two performing arts companies have approached The Company to provide entertainment for such fundraising events at less than their normal fee or pro-bono.  Members of the community, who have not worked with The Company before, have volunteered to help plan several large fundraising events. A full-time fundraising person will be hired and brought on board to work with businesses and members of the community to retire debt and raise funds for renovations.  The Company will soon establish an endowment fund to help run and maintain the building once it is completed.  A percent of all fundraising will be earmarked for this endowment fund.  It is estimated, that once The Company owns the building, funds will be raised to retire the mortgage and then funds raised will go toward renovations.   Board Member Gregory Brennan has offered to work full-time with The Company as a fundraiser.  His background includes raising large sums of money for a theater program on the East Coast and for Network Theatre Company of Oakland.  His estimated start date is February 1, 2003.  A Capital Campaign Committee is being formed to include several community leaders who have come forward to help with the project.  It is anticipated that this Committee will begin work as soon as Mr. Brennan is on board. 		<p><u>Who May Use This Building?</u><u> </u>		<p>Vallejo Music Theatre will use the building for three productions a year; two major musicals and one original work and youth program.  Other companies which may use the building are the Vallejo Symphony Orchestra, Vallejo Community Concert Association, Vallejo Choral Society, African-American Choral Group, Solano Choral Society and Well Tempered Voices, Harbor Youth Theatre Company, Vallejo Jazz Festival&#146;s preview party, Dark Room Productions, Network Theatre, Inc., (an Oakland based company currently working with us on fundraising), Melody Choral Society, Vallejo Ballet Conservatory, Benicia Ballet Academy, Young Performers recitals, North Bay Opera, Fairfield Civic Theatre, California Music Teachers Association&#146;s annual recital, African-American Dance Academy, LG Filipino Performing Group, vocal teachers recitals, meeting place for large gatherings where a theater venue is required (small conventions, Chamber of Commerce seminars) and many others.   		<p><u>In Summary </u>		<p>Although this project is an ambitious one, it is feasible.  The growth of Vallejo Music Theatre may lead us in unexpected directions; we may need to develop a second organization which handles on the renovation of the Federal Building (or any other building) to provide this much needed performing arts venue in downtown Vallejo.		<p>Vallejo Music Theatre is convinced that the best place to develop this venue is in the downtown Vallejo Area and will work with all groups in developing an Arts and Entertainment District.		<p>For information write Vallejo Music Theatre, P. O. Box 186, Vallejo, CA 94590 or call the Managing Director, Judith H. Brown at 707.265.0733 or Tom Bartee, President, Vallejo Main Street Program at 707.557.6762.		<p><u>A Little History</u>		<p>Vallejo Music Theatre was formed as an outgrowth of the Vallejo Fine Arts Council&#146;s desire to provide money for lighting instruments for Hogan Auditorium.  The first production was Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#146;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1967 which raised over $3,000 and was given to the Vallejo City Unified School District for lighting instruments		<p> The Company incorporated in 1968 as The Group Theatre and later added &quot;Vallejo&quot; to its name.  They continued to work at Hogan Auditorium each summer through 1984 when the Company was invited to form a theater company at the Solano County Fairgrounds.  This project ended in 1986; The Company returned to perform at Hogan Auditorium and in 1994, because of high rental fees imposed by the Vallejo		<p>City Unified School District moved on to other venues in the city including Indian Alley Theatre (now closed), Owens Theatre and MIRA Theatre.  		<p> In 1978 the Company increased its programming to two major musicals a year and in 1986 changed the company name to Vallejo Music Theatre, which more aptly suited its goals, purpose and mission.  Around this same time The Company formed a professional playwrights group, &quot;California On Stage,&quot; and with some funding from the California Arts Council worked with several professional playwrights in the Bay Area to create plays based on the history of California.  The Company gradually left the organization in capable hands and again focused primarily on Community Theater in Vallejo.		<p> Besides musicals the group, since 1985, also produces an annual Community Messiah Sing-Along, usually the first Saturday in December, to begin the Christmas Season.   In the fall of 1999 the company moved to the Fetterly Playhouse for the Arts, where they currently reside.  Also, in 1999 VMT teamed up with the Vallejo Community Concert Association and Benicia Old Town Theatre Group to form a Performing Arts Alliance to increase ticket sales for all three groups.  The program was put on hold in 2001.  In the meantime, the Concert Association and VMT have held an annual coordinated Oktoberfest in October to raise funds for children&#146;s programs.		<p> The Company currently has a 16 member Board of Directors and seeks to grow it to 25 with the addition of representatives of many local cultural and arts groups during 2003.  		<p> Each year in February, the Company holds a major fundraiser with a professional auctioneer, live and silent auctions and an elegant dinner served by one of Vallejo&#146;s finest catering companies.  		<p>The summer musicals feature many children, giving them an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the performing arts.  Vallejo Music Theatre hires professional directors and designers for all of its productions.  		<p> Beginning in 2002 the Company sponsored an original musical developed by a group of young producers, approved by the Disney Corporation and featuring many children and teenagers.  Plans are to continue this program in one way or another to give beginning playwrights and producers a chance to develop their skills and talents.		<p> Now Vallejo Music Theatre takes on the greatest challenge of all; developing its own performing arts venue with a plan to include as many performing arts groups as possible in the programming of the two proposed new theaters.		<p><b>Board of Directors </b>		<p><b>Scott Hanes,</b> President, Vallejo.
