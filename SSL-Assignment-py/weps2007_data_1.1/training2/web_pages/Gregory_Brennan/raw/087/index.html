<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The business administrator for the Jackson Board of
Education, Gregory Brennan, called the school election this week: &quot;A mandate from the
people.&quot;&nbsp; Incumbent BOE member Chuck Murphy said he was &quot;humbled&quot; by
the vote that returned him to office by a wide margin, and former BOE Gus Acevedo,
returned to the board after a one-year hiatus, noted that his campaign was staffed by
&quot;teenagers&quot; and &quot;regular&quot; people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank goodness for regular people.&nbsp; &quot;Regular&quot; people are
what make this country great.&nbsp; &quot;Regular&quot; people are not the wealthy, or
politicians; corporate managers or those with advanced college degrees, or those with who
have a fifth grade education and limited future possibilities.&nbsp; Rather, regular
people are all of those - and far more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Regular&quot; people are you and I, and all of those around us.
&nbsp; White, black, red, yellow, Christian, Moslem, Jew, Shintoist, or atheist.&nbsp; We
are all &quot;regular&quot; people, when counted individually, but united as
&quot;Americans&quot; (Don't ever be ashamed of the word for, despite our failings, we
remain the envy of much of the World) we are, perhaps, the greatest governmental anomaly
in the history of our planet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For much of the history or Man, power has been inherited by right of
&quot;divine&quot; succession, or through strength of arms (war).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, some 200-plus years ago, American settlers, owing to their
allegiance to the British Crown, became adverse to continued abuses by that Parliament - a
governing body that was itself regarded as fairly &quot;liberal&quot; by the standards of
the times.&nbsp; In many other countries, the ruler had absolute authority, with no
recourse for the &quot;regular&quot; people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was evolution, or perhaps God had just had enough of such
behavior.&nbsp; Anyway, in the 1700s, discontent grew common in the 13 colonies that were
to become the independent nation that would provide a blueprint for freedom for many other
countries, including France.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the teapot boiled over.&nbsp; It started with &quot;Sons of
Liberty&quot; dumping British tea into Boston Harbor rather than pay the tea tax. &nbsp;
Eventually, it resulted in a document that would profoundly change the world forever -
&quot;In Congress, July 4, 1776, The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States
of America.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas Paine, a journalist, was a prime instigator of the rebellion,
and two prominent Colonists, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, another journalist,
were the primary composers of this declaration of rebellion against the morés of the
planet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their revolt eventually led to victory and development of another vital
document of freedom - the United States Constitution, with its individual Bill of Rights.
&nbsp; Never before had individuals been granted such sweeping freedoms in a published
document.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it work?</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, we can't help but wonder at the
divine guidance which must have inspired diverse elements in our society to craft these
magnificent documents.&nbsp; Work they did, perhaps [in a] far better fashion than Tom
Paine, Thomas Jefferson, or &quot;Poor Richard&quot; could ever have dreamed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could any of those three great men have possibly envisioned cities with
millions of people, or school districts with as many students as the largest cities of
that era?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We think not.&nbsp; Yet, these documents crafted in rebellion have
stood the test of time and continue to provide a system of laws that enable
&quot;regular&quot; people to govern themselves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, none of our founding fathers could have envisioned local school
districts with $60-million budgets, or elementary schools that would cost $20-million.
&nbsp; In Jackson and Howell, schools earlier in this century were much like those of
Jefferson, Franklin, and Paine's time - one room schoolhouses - such as Ardena and
Prospertown Schools.&nbsp; Even during the early years of this century, such structures
incurred nominal cost when built.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Times change.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, Jackson approved three sorely needed referendum
questions that included expansion of the high school, technology improvements throughout
the school system, and a new elementary school for this burgeoning community.&nbsp; For
the first time in 10 years, the budget was approved by voters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In adjacent Howell, voters apparently sensed economic realities and
went against the overall Monmouth County tide.&nbsp; They reportedly vetoed the 8.8
percent increase in the school budget and an additional $8.4 million outlay for
&quot;technology&quot; improvements in the schools.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Howell, only 12-percent of the registered voters turned out, and we
are certain that the &quot;sour grapes/Monday morning quarterback&quot; contingent will
hasten to complain about apathy being responsible for the respective defeats.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an easy trap for the gullible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our younger days, we fell for the same argument - no more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When registered voters fail to turn out for the polls, they are,
nonetheless, casting a vote.&nbsp; By failing to vote, they are expressing their opinion
that they don't care enough to travel to a nearby polling place.&nbsp; If the result goes
against their wishes, <em>THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN</em>. &nbsp; Those voters
abrogated their responsibility under the rules of our society.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They allowed others to make the decisions and, therefore, <em>HAVE NO
RIGHT TO COMPLAIN</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our free society comes with certain inherent obligations.&nbsp; Voting
is one of them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether bureaucrats like it or not, the people have spoken.</strong></p>
