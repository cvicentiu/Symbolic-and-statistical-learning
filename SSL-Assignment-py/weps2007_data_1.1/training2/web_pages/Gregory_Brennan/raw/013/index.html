</CENTER>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Is this a good time to start your own business?</B><BR><BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>oday, more and more of the jobs being created are
temporary jobs, part-time jobs, or contract work. The reason
is simple and understandable. Today's companies want the freedom
of hiring and firing at will. This is a very good time to say
that this rollercoaster of uncertainty isn't for you. At the
very least, you should be researching the possibilities of self-employment.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you work in a typewriter repair shop, you should
be noticing that most people are not using typewriters any more.
 The time for you to act is now. If you work in a tire store
and the business is half what it was a year ago, don't be surprised
when you are unemployed. The time for you to consider acting
is now. Keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities.<BR><BR><BR>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Why are you such a strong advocate of going into 
a family business?</B><BR><BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f you had to work in a family furniture business
as a kid, this may be the last place that you want to work now,
and yet living rooms and dining rooms and kitchens may offer the
best opportunities for you. It seems that if you work in a business
as a kid, you somehow gain an instinctive feel for how things
are done. Your father or grandfather may have many established
contacts with furniture manufacturers and wholesalers that would
take others years to acquire.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you view your business as a means to an end, the
end being a comfortable lifestyle for yourself and your family,
then furniture may be the quickest and safest path to your goal.
 If you didn't like the way your uncle or father or grandmother
ran the business, now is your chance to run the business right
- your way.<BR><BR><BR>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>What do you mean by &quot;love your customers&quot;?</B><BR><BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hink of what you want in life for yourself and your
family. You want nice cars and homes and vacations and education,
and you want a comfortable retirement. All of your material wants
take money, and there is only one person who is ever going to
give you money - your customer. Your customer, or your patient,
or your client, or your tenant.
Let's say that you are in the graphics design business
and want to buy a new color printer. You need money. You go
to the bank and borrow the money. Now, you have to pay the money
back, but it really isn't your money that pays those loans back.
 It is your customers' money. It is all those wonderful companies
and advertising agencies that you work for, that hire you to design
their cards and letters and boxes, who pay you back. The money
comes from your customers. You borrow money and someone else
pays it back. If you view your customers from this perspective,
you'll love them. It is your customer and only your customer
who is going to give you the money to realize your financial objectives.<BR><BR><BR>
