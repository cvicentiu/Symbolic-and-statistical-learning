Date: Mon, 20 Mar 2000 09:18:40 -0800

Hey-
  I've been forced into a sys. admin position for a Linux server at my
work.  Major crisis time.  I've done a lot of programming with Unix and
Linux before, but I've never had to install or maintain the software
before now.  Here's the situation.  Any help I can get would be VERY
appreciated.  (And if you could e-mail it to [EMAIL PROTECTED], it
would be even more appreciated)
  I've got RedHat Linux 6.1 running, and X Windows installed and
running on top of that.  Now, I'm trying to run Java servlets (I've
also gotten ApacheJServ up and running) which create and save graphical
files (In the JPEG format, at the moment).  The java classes run find
in both the Linux environment and the Windows environment (They're
going to be run with Linux as the server and Windows as the client),
but the Java Server can't seem to be able to use the X Windows
graphics.  According to the documentation I've seen, something called
the DISPLAY variable needs to be set, but nothing I can find says where
you set it, or what it should be set to.  Is this the solution to my
problems?  If so, where is the DISPLAY, and how do I set it?
THANKS!
Mike

I get the error:

        This should not happen!
        An unresolved function was called!

When checking the log, I notice that the module 'xie' failed to load because
of an undefined symbol. Whats going on?

Maybe you have the same the problem as me. I too couldn't find  the
glide man page and the glide driver. It turned out that the XFree86
ftp mirror from which I downloaded X had a previous version of X in a
directory called "4.0". This version doesn't contain the glide stuff.
I downloaded version 4.0 and it worked with glide and Voodoo2.

I seem to be getting closer using the Voodoo3 AGP (3500 TV) and a Voodoo3
PCI  card,.With the PCI card set as primary,  my machine completely locks
up when the X server tries to soft boot the AGP card.

BTW, I was able to get everyting working fine with a Voodo3 2000 PCI and a
TNT2 card.

There's no perfect valilla option that I know of, unless you want to use the
16 colors server (which would be a very, very, very, very, very bad choice

&gt; &gt;&gt; I am having a problem getting xwindows to start on my freshly
&gt; &gt;&gt; installed Linux Mandrake 7.0 installation.  I am using what I believe
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be supported Number 9 Revolution 3D 4 meg AGP card and a ViewSonic

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Fatal Server Error:
&gt; &gt;&gt; no screens found

&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess the short answer is that this means xwindows won't run.  Does

It certainly is not!
There is *no* BSD code in the Linux network stack.
In ancient times (we're talking linux 0.9x/1.0) there was a port of
the BSD network stack to linux, but it was never really used.

The network stack in linux is original work, it's not based on any
previous implementation.
It's been rewritten from scratch several times, and is at it's fourth
generation (NET4.0) in 2.2.x

No it's not.
Linux is just the kernel, nothing else, that cannot be argued.
Unlike FreeBSD which includes the userland too. 

Lot's of distributions use the Linux kernel, but that's really a
different thing entirely, they could in theory just as well have used
the FreeBSD kernel (can you say Redhat/FreeBSD :))

I have an AGP ATI Rage card running on a K6-2-400, and after fighting
with all the libraries and various distributions in their various
forms, I've gotten my system to a stable state where it consistently
hangs after XF86Setup tries the restart the server. When XF86Setup
starts it doesn't recognize any clockchip or RamDac, and I usually set
the identifier to r128 (but not always). It seems that no matter what
I do here, when I'm "Done", XF86Setup tries to restart the server
(SVGA), and it hangs so bad, that I gotta Ctrl-Alt-Del to get out of
it. This has happened with all the various tinkerings that I've done
in XF86Setup... which is usually wrt the video hardware. I've read all
the documentation, but it doesn't seem to know any problems this
advanced.
        I'm not sure what to tell you about my system. It's running
kernel 2.2.14, and XFree 3.3.6. My mb has 160Mb PC-100 and my card has
16Mb.

What is the video driver on those machines?  I have a Compaq Presario
1600s with ATI Rage LT Pro.

The information on <A  HREF="http://www.delanoscientific.com/cpq1675.html">http://www.delanoscientific.com/cpq1675.html</A> HAS
(past tense) worked for me but after I upgraded to RedHat 6.2 with
XFree86 3.3.6 I have terrible flicker and verticle bars at those
XF86Config settings and I even have bad flicker at 640x800.

I have noticed this change from 3.3.5 to 3.3.6 in my startx log:
3.3.5: 
(--) mach64: 1024x768 panel (ID 2) detected: clock 65.14 MHz
3.3.6: 
(--) mach64: 1024x768 panel (ID 2) detected: clock 25.46 MHz

So where the heck did that come from?

At present I have dropped my Mach_64 rpm of XF86 down to 3.3.5 and I
still have the same problems.

As far as I know, it's so that xterm can update the utmp database. Each

Date: Mon, 20 Mar 2000 22:22:57 GMT

Thanks for the input.  I finally got it working last night, here's a
couple of comments.  For the current q3 download out now(q3demo not
q3test) they changed the keyword from r_glDriver to r_gldriver.  That
caused some problems, and you need to direct it to
/usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so, thats the mesa that comes with X 4.0 with the
DRI stuff in it.  If you try to run the DRI server with the non-DRI GL
lib it defaults to Mesa software and you get a 1 fps choppy menu that
kind of hard to get out of.

&gt; &gt; Not positive if my problem was exactly the same, but it was at least
&gt; &gt; very similar. I had to delete the quake3 config file created in your
&gt; &gt; .q3a/q3demo directory. That at least got me to the menu. Something
is
&gt; &gt; still not right for me though. The menu will come up, but it very,
very
&gt; &gt; choppy and unresponsive. Takes about 5 minutes to blindly hit the ~
key
&gt; &gt; and type quit to get out.
&gt;
&gt; Try to start q3 with:
&gt;
&gt; ./linuxquake3 +set in_dgamouse 0 +set r_glDriver
libMesaVoodooGL.so.3.1
&gt;
&gt; works fine at Q3 Test 1.07, perhaps with any other version, too.

Subject: Re: Ethernet Initialisation prevents applications from running !! Help !!
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2000 08:43:28 +1000

Ok that command did run and didn't return anything however when I try and
run another application it still brings up the error that states it cannot
connect to the server.

Maybe it is something else that is causing it ? A friend of mine said that
it may be the fact that my ethernet card is a pcmcia card and the ethernet
is not intialising at start-up and therefore the xserver can't bind to it.
If this is the case does anyone know how I can fix it ?

Thanks for your reply

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Everytime I intialise the network (eth0) it causes an error that doesn't
&gt; &gt; allow me to start any applications. Ther error is along the lines of:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Xlib: cannot connect to the server ":0.0"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I currently run Red Hat 6.1 on a laptop with a Xircom ethernet / modem
card.
&gt; &gt; I can ping address through the card and can even use the internet on
another
&gt; &gt; machine through IP chains. I just can't run any applications of the
linux
&gt; &gt; box after the ethernet has been initialised. Can someone tell me what is
&gt; &gt; causeing this problem and how I can go about fixing it. I am a relative
&gt; &gt; dummy so tell me in fairly easy terms please !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please Help Me !!

&gt; I have similar problems, and it seems that saying
&gt;
&gt; Option "noaccel"

Well, didn't do any difference for me... I am sure it was activated, since
the server did run much slower, and the mouse cursor did disappear. Also the
server printout told me (after the reboot) that it was activated. Possible I
did earlier say that it did not crash for me when switching to a console,
but that is not true. Seems like it is hanging when switching away from
graphics mode.

&gt; Thanks, but assuming you mean the BusID field, I do have it set. It
