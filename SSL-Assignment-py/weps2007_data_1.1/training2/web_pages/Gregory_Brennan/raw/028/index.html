Many would say that&#8217;sexactly how they remembered Shane, despite his history of medical troubles.</p> <p>According to Shane&#8217;s father, Tim, Shane suffered from chronic health problems since birth. He received a heart transplant on March 21, 1994, exactly nine years before he died. In the summer of 1999, he rejected the heart, leading to a second transplant during his sophomore year at St. Bonaventure. He contracted diabetes after the operation.</p> <p>Shane&#8217;s roommates &#8212; seniors Jeff Folck, Kevin Okun and Carlton Ashton &#8212;foundShane lying on the floor and not breathing in the morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Folck, he immediately called Security Services.&nbsp; He saidthe roommates surrounded Shane &#8212; one at his head, one at his side, and thelast at his feet &#8212; in order to lay him on his back. That scene resonated intheir memories later in the friary when they saw a painting by Br. David Haack,O.F.M., depicting three friars surrounding St. Francis as he died -&#8211; oneat his head, one at his side and one at his feet. &#8220;I looked at it in amazementand said, that is us,&#8221; Folck said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Br. Basil Valente, O.F.M., Bob Donius, vice president of university ministries, Sr. Noella Poinsette, O.S.F., and many of Shane&#8217;s close friends planned a prayer service that day in his memory. About 300 students, faculty, administrators and staff gathered to pray, grieve, share stories, sing and celebrate his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shane is survived by his father, his mother, Sue, and his younger sister, Erin, of Wellsville. The wake was held at J.W. Embser Sons Funeral Home Inc. in Wellsville on March 24.&nbsp; Walter Gardner, co-funeral director, estimated 775 people came during calling hours. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen this many (people come)before,&#8221; he said. He described the line of visitors as a &#8220;traffic hazard,&#8221; as it went down the driveway and past the entrance. &#8220;It&#8217;s unique because hetouched so many people &#8212; <br> <br> the communities of St. Bonaventure, Wellsville and Buffalo,&#8221; Gardner said.<br> A Mass of Christian burial was held March 26 in the Immaculate Conception Church, in Wellsville. Attendees included friends, family and university administrators,including Fr. Dominic V. Monti, O.F.M., interim university president. Fr.Dominic concelebrated the mass with Fr. Gregory Brennan, O.F.M., Fr. DanRiley, O.F.M., and Fr. Jud Weiksnar, O.F.M.</p> <p>Shane has been an anchor and news director at the campus radio station The Buzz, editor in chief at The Bona Venture, prose editor for the Laurel. He also worked for the Campus Activities Board during his college career.&nbsp;</p> <p>Back home in Wellsville, Shane was co-chair of the Wellsville Area Satellite, Variety Club of Buffalo, and had received the Variety Club &#8220;Satellite Person of the Year&#8221; in 2002. He was a member of the Sons of the American Legion Squadron#702 in Wellsville and of the Wellsville Elks Lodge #1495.</p> <p>Lee Coppola, dean of the journalism school, said Colligan was &#8220;fervently intent on being a journalist,&#8221; which is why he was allowed to take two courses via the Internet from his bedroom in Wellsville while waiting for his surgery.</p> <p>Denny Wilkins, associate professor of journalism, said he taught Shane over e-mail. &#8220;He completed the course, and I believe he got an A,&#8221; Wilkins said.</p> <p>Shane&#8217;s father said he knew all along his son wanted to be a journalist. At the age of 9, he and his sister began the Colligan Courier and the Whitney Place News, a one-page newspaper sold to neighbors.<br> &#8220;He was a newsman for a long time,&#8221; Colligan said. &#8220;It was in his blood.&#8221;</p> <p>According to Colligan, the Shane T. Colligan Scholarship Fund will be formedfor future eligible journalism students. Donations can be sent to the ShaneT. Colligan Memorial Scholarship, c/o Francis Hall, St. Bonaventure University,St. Bonaventure, NY 14778.</p> <p>Colligan said he spoke with Fr. Dominic, who said Shane earned his diploma and that he will be recognized.&nbsp; &#8220;We would love to hang Shane&#8217;s degree on our wall. Shane worked so hard for that.&nbsp; I had no doubt in my mind that he would&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; he said. Colligan said Coppola agreed that Shane should get a diploma. &#8220;He packed more life into 23 years than a person could in 63 years. We taught him journalism and, in return, he taught us about life.&#8221;&nbsp;Coppola said.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>   &nbsp;</p> <p><b><font color="#7f303c">&middot;&nbsp; &middot;&nbsp; &middot;</font></b></p> <p>Return to <i><a href="index.html">  The Communicator</a> </i>. <br>  &nbsp; </p> </body></html>
