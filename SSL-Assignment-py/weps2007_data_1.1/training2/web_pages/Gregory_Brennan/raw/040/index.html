<p>The sky brightened into shades of gray and, from Overlook Road in Cleveland Heights, silver-plated Lake Erie. The steel skin of a small airplane caught the daylight and turned to chrome, pressing like a fender against the air above that horizon. Nearer, in the middle distance of the back yard, the branches of a forsythia looked like feathers rubbed the wrong way. Straight as a tent pole the buckeye tree stood its ground, prompted by an early spring to veil its poisonous young shoots in gauzy spires of colorless bloom. <p>    In the foreground, Audrey was reflected in the kitchen window. She had wakened as usual without the aid of an alarm, slipping from the mystery of a dream that was enthralling if only because, custom made, the dream meant what it meant to her alone. Already the dream had given over to dread, vanishing from consciousness like some amazingly intricate insect whose whole life cycle takes no longer than a headache and leaves even less of a trace. She hadn’t known dread could come in three equivalent dimensions, nor that the deepest could have been the most easily prevented. It wasn’t within her control to be accepted to medical school, and neither was it possible to know whether, if she was admitted, it would eventually turn out to be the right decision to have made. But she’d chosen not to tell Gregory of her application, and, standing at the kitchen counter they’d shared for the twenty years of their marriage, as she watched the first light infuse itself into their view, she was afraid that her good reasons for not telling him weren’t good enough. <p>    In their bed he was still asleep, embracing his king-size pillows, laboring through dreams that, like his work in the court system, always had elaborate plot lines. Travel-brochure dreams was what he called these journeys beyond the wonders of the world. In them, every now and then he traveled solo, but the more elaborate they were, the more essential to them was Audrey, who couldn’t speak any of the languages — whereas he could speak them all — but whose first-aid kit kept them safe from every disaster. He’d never tell Audrey this because, as he’d be the first to admit, it was all plagiarized material. <p>    Sleeping, he escaped the nightmare of being awake to contemplate the senseless death of Rob Wallace, a younger judge with more promise than one person was ever given to contain, of a heart attack at forty-one. Every time he thought about Rob, Gregory felt a sharp heat behind his eyes. Rob’s reputation for genuine wisdom went not just beyond his years but beyond even the legal code. Oh sure, every lawyer was expected to exercise judgment informed by the mind and the heart, but in Rob it was like watching instinct and learning in a fusion made stunning by its seeming effortlessness. Gregory wasn’t often persuaded by hyperbole, but he’d believed Rob was a genius. The violation of his sudden early death — might over right — offended Gregory’s entire belief system, but more, it pained him horribly, personally. Not even Audrey fully understood it made him want to quit altogether. At sixty-three he’d already seen everything, some of it twice. <p>    The trouble was, her own future was coming toward Audrey like too good a pitch not to take a swing at. She had always wondered why it was considered better to believe in a “half-full” glass when a “half-empty” glass creates a greater urgency to make it full. By this logic her life felt invitingly half empty. She was more ready for this upcoming birthday than for any previous milestone, because this time she’d given herself the gift of believing in fifty — fifty - fifty — as half of adulthood. What better opportunity could there be than the convergence of plain ambition and the mythic empty nest? The intervention of Rob’s death was a tragedy, certainly, but it was also an instance of ordinary bad timing, because it coincided with Audrey’s application deadline, which, although perhaps mistakenly, she’d decided not to miss. Louise Schneider, the physician in charge of the MetroHealth Clinic, where Audrey worked, had convinced Audrey that the best thing she had going for her was that few veteran nurses ever voluntarily jumped overboard into shark-infested waters. Who could resist sending a rescue boat to bring her in alive? <p>    The sky was taking on color, a comfortingly pale pink like the inside of an infant’s mouth, and Lake Erie had become, all the way to the border with Canada beyond the horizon, the shiny, smooth metallic rose of those American sedans driven by elderly women. In the middle of this continuum Audrey felt a combined gratitude and hope that made her feel both lucky and unfulfilled. Now she could see in the back yard that the grass needed to be cut, and with equal light outside and in, she could no longer see her reflection in the kitchen window. Anyway, she’d switched from the nuisance of eyeglasses to the ease of her contact lenses, transparent slices of perfect vision unrestricted by frames. And since Overlook Road rode the hip of the hill above Case Western Reserve University, the medical school was practically already within her view, even if only literally. Her question was, what else was she overlooking? <p>    This nicely sited Colonial had been their starter house because, by the time Gregory married, he was already a judge elected to the same Common Pleas Court as, by now, he’d spent his entirely contented career. But since the court isn’t officially in session without the judge present in the courtroom, she’d been the one to accommodate her work schedule to the needs of their daughters, so that, for example, she’d never missed a weekday lacrosse game. Today’s was conveniently at Magnificat and, for a change, she wouldn’t have to rush all the way across the city to get from Metro to the game. Her note to Gregory told him she and Sally would stop after the game for the makings of a special dinner. It went without saying that she’d choose a favorite of his in order to try to cheer him up a little, no matter that, ever since Rob, nothing much could. <p>    It was just as well, then, that they’d postponed their anniversary trip to Paris, settling instead for one overnight at the Ritz-Carlton above the Cuyahoga River with a dinner of Dover sole slid away from the bone by their white-gloved waiter. Twenty years before, they’d spent that same March night there too, but the next evening, that time, they’d used their tickets to Paris. Gregory had known from the start that, unlike himself, his new wife loved surprises, so they’d flown into their marriage on Air France, Première Classe, and, because he’d retrieved his good French with a fresh round of lessons, all the flight attendants complimented his accent while offering them endless amounts of the best champagne onboard. For their tenth anniversary they’d returned to Paris for those intimate interiors of restaurants and museums, and a deep hotel bed that was half the size of their own at home. <p>    Audrey shivered as she shut the door behind her, trading the kitchen’s relative heat for the chilly, damp garage. Even in March she had twice experienced Paris as both the City of Light and of Warmth, and for this revisit she’d imagined their extended conversations in compassionate detail. The one about medical school would have gone well because it could be continued from morning to night to morning, until Gregory agreed with Louise Schneider that, unless Audrey gave herself the option of applying, the possibility of her ever becoming a physician would remain an opportunity missed by the feeble excuse of an unasked question. Any actual encounter here at home, in the context of Rob’s death and their own lives, could only by definition go far less well. This anticipation alone almost made Audrey wish she would be rejected. <p>When the walk-in clinic opened up every day, patients who’d been able to wait through the night arrived promptly, lining up for diagnosis. It was her job to be ready for anything, and Audrey found she liked this methodical problem-solving aspect of the work, verifying her powers of observation, expanding her caring skills. <p>    “Any day now, I hear,” Louise confided obliquely, not wanting to divulge the contents of a letter that was already in the mail. She couldn’t imagine herself beginning medical school again, but no doubt this was because she knew all it entailed. Similarly, Audrey had said she couldn’t think of having another baby at this point in her life, notwithstanding that she was perhaps still biologically capable. And yet, if Louise were to ask Audrey’s advice about whether or not to have a baby at her age, no doubt Audrey would be encouraging. Just as nobody could argue against a prospective mother who was both eager and mature, in Louise’s opinion the medical profession should require all doctors to be nurses first. Audrey was going to be a far better physician than most, because she knew how to handle, hands on, someone who wasn’t feeling very well. <p>    Audrey asked, “And?” But she didn’t let Louise say anything more. “No, never mind, don’t say anything. You can’t be sure until —” <p>    Louise laughed and said, “Until you open the envelope?” <p>    “Some call this the scientific method, but its other name is —” <p>    “Superstition?” <p>    “Pessimism.” Audrey handed Louise a folder and said, now gravely, “Just as in the examining room right now we have either a terrible fall or a serious case of child abuse.” All too often the women were also abused, but they rarely brought themselves in. <p>    This was the worst part of the job, so Louise displayed an appropriate reluctance, hesitating at the door. “How will we ever get our women to come in preventively? Can you answer me that?” <p>    “Not yet.” But in fact this was the very question motivating Audrey’s medical school application. <p>    Out in the waiting room there was a chronically asthmatic family of six, none of whom had slept through the previous night. A third-grader had a sprained foot and was glad for the borrowed crutches but very disappointed not to have a bone fracture requiring a cast. A regular customer read the paper in her usual seat, needing the company of this room in addition to the proven benefits of medication and psychiatric social work. Audrey was acutely aware of the burden it was to provide solutions to real problems, but never more than now, when Louise had practically just told her, by a sly wink, what she seemed to know for a fact: all of this would one day be hers. <p>    They were more or less the same age, so Louise represented not only the current goal but the alternative opportunity Audrey might have had in the first place. That is, if she hadn’t had two older brothers setting the vocational tone, maybe the decision-making would have ended up differently in her own case. But as it was, Johnny and Neil went directly into the family business — Morrow’s Pharmacy, the last independent not to sell out to the Rite-Aid chain — so it didn’t occur to their parents to reinvent the wheel. It was only after their father’s death nine years ago that Neil moved to New York, asserting his own wish to teach grade school and live with a partner of the same sex. <p>    Audrey was at Kent State that deadly spring of 1970 when Ohio college students were fired upon, ending the era when it was still possible to expect a daughter to want a life not unlike her mother’s. “You’ll want to choose something you can go back to once your kids are in school” had been her father’s kind-intentioned advice. This was in their one and only conversation about what Audrey wanted to be when she grew up, when they’d sat at the kitchen table one Sunday afternoon. <p>    In those days it was a diner-style booth built into a corner, and Audrey remembered leaning against the wall. Her father had been working his crossword puzzle, his glasses resting low in a bifocal effect. <p>    She’d responded, “You mean, like a teacher?” and he’d said, “Yes, sure, or maybe a nurse. Your good grades in math and science qualify you, I bet.” <p>    And that was all there was, and all there ever was, to it. Audrey’s mother, Celia, had entered the Flora Stone Mather College for Women on Euclid Avenue, but she had never finished. No woman on either side of the family had ever gone to graduate school, so when Audrey continued on for her M.S.N., she’d had no reason to think this degree wouldn’t be enough. And in one sense her father was correct, even prescient, in knowing that once her kids were in school — although of course he’d meant elementary school, not college — she’d return to the fulfillment of her own ambitions. Where he was wrong was in not knowing that all her life, Audrey, his youngest child and only daughter, wanted just one thing she’d never had: to be the one in charge. <p>    But on the wards, ironically, the nurses were the ones “in charge.” Although the doctors gave the orders, they took advice from the nurses, who were there on the scene and could observe either progress or decline. It was more of a partnership, before two things happened to change the relationship between doctors and nurses, malpractice suits and managed care, each of which forced doctors and nurses into opposite corners. And if it was less rewarding to be a nurse these days, it had also become more challenging to be a physician required to become more collaborative while being the bottom-line decision-maker. <p>    “Doctor, can you please tell me how much longer it will be before I can be seen?” The woman never made eye contact with Audrey, so there was no point in Audrey’s correcting her to say she was still just a nurse. “Sure, Helena” was Audrey’s ever-tolerant reply, every day, “just let me check.” She picked up the phone to dial the extension for the office a few doors down the corridor. “They can take you right away,” she said, knowing as did her counterpart in counseling that Helena would need another few hours. <p>    But this is just what Audrey meant. Instead of being the one, or one of the ones, who shuffled Helena from place to place while supplying comfort along the way, she would rather provide the cure. She wanted Helena healed once and for all, so the poor woman could spend her life somewhere other than in this windowless room, hour after hour, day after day. There had to be some discovery out there, but not yet made, that in Helena’s situation would make all the difference. Yes, Audrey was admittedly foolishly overambitious, given that the psychiatric social worker in charge was doing the best he could. And yet Audrey needed to try, just as Helena obviously needed the help. <p>    “Don’t let him get away!” was her father’s only other direct advice to her, to marry Gregory Brennan. Gregory was nine years older than her brother Johnny, but because he’d poured his heart into the justice system he’d become forty-three and unmarried. Audrey was already twenty-nine at the time, so from her father’s point of view it was practically too late. Needless to say, Audrey and Gregory had had their kids immediately, which turned out to be a good thing, because Jack Morrow had only ten more years to get to know his grandchildren. <p>    Audrey watched Helena settle down again with the newspaper, and she found herself wishing that her father were alive so she could tell him he’d been right, twice. <p>Gregory sometimes allowed himself a “snooze” bonus, knowing that only one, at most, was his limit. Taking best advantage of these nine extra minutes, he would take inventory, performing a checklist worthy of bench science. These days his inquiry concerned mortality, and the question he asked himself was whether or not any progress had been made on why senseless death still occurred. <p>    There was Rob’s in particular, although of course this didn’t mean he was incapable of caring about natural disasters wiping out whole populations, not to mention countless innocents in war zones. For the greater good there was one who should have been spared, because Rob Wallace’s rare intelligence was organic, manifested with the giant ease of a tree making oxygen from daylight. Rob’s imagination was so large with promise, the size of his absence was increasing every day instead of diminishing. Missing Rob was like discovering, item by item, how much more than you reported at the time the thief actually made off with. <p>    The alarm sounded again, to signal the end of this nine- minute opportunity to feel worse about the morning than when it had first interrupted sleep’s unconscious balancing of plus and minus. This time there was no proof of the possibility of self-improvement, just the destructive power of a cheap plastic box the size of a hardball. Now he was required to rouse his daughter Sally, who’d roll into another school day of this senior year rendered utterly untroubled four months ago by Early Decision. Sally’s immediate future at Virginia was by now so thoroughly imagined, the prolonged anticlimax seemed to make her restless all over again, as she admitted to envying those classmates who were just learning what options they had, or not. <p>    Still, Gregory got out of bed and went down the short hall to his daughter’s closed door. “Sally? Honey?” He always announced himself, no matter that while he was sleeping his younger child had turned eighteen’s corner into adulthood. He opened her bedroom door and, because there was nothing subtle about Sally, shook her. “Sally? Honey?” The expression on her face was so unpleasant it was almost ugly. <p>    He hated this, the one part of the job he wouldn’t miss when Sally went off to college. “Get up!” he said like a tyrant, which he also hated, although nothing less had ever proved effective. Good luck to her roommate, he told himself as he returned to the sanctuary of his bedroom, and that went for everybody including, one day, he hoped, her future husband. Gregory caught himself hoping he’d still be alive for that day. <p>    But if you did the math, it wasn’t altogether self-pity that caused Gregory not to take another decade for granted. Even without the shadow of Rob’s depressing death, it was a fact that he was born during the Great Depression. If you asked him, the impact was obvious. <p>    And yet, more like a man with everything going his way, he showered and dressed in one of the European tailored suits he always wore even though only ten inches of trouser showed beneath his robes. He matched his tie to the thin blue of the sky, pretending to optimism. Downstairs, he could see that the Plain Dealer was in its plastic bag at their door ahead of the New York Times, and he took this as a good sign, validating his decision, at the time unheard-of, to leave a major Wall Street firm for a hometown practice. Wait. This choice had been corroborated so thoroughly, so long ago, why did it even come to mind? <p>    “Hey, Dad,” Sally allowed in her morning monotone, slumping into the kitchen so gracelessly it seemed impossible to believe she was the star of her own lacrosse video, prized by college recruiters with outsized budgets, who’d flattered her with such overblown promises she thought they could only be false. <p>    “Hi, champ.” <p>    She never said anything more, nor did he, usually. But he said, “Good luck.” <p>    “Huh?” <p>    “Today’s game.” <p>    She squinted at the refrigerator door. “Magnificat,” she read from the athletic schedule posted there. <p>    In this undefeated season he knew better than to ask which was the better team, so Gregory merely repeated, “Good luck.” His own West Side alma mater, St. Ignatius, currently had the best high school football team in the nation, but he was more invested in Sally’s games. <p>    “Okay,” she said, but with an expression that could be the ancestor of a smile. At least something gave her pleasure, even if winning was always, by definition, at someone else’s expense. <p>    This generation of kids had everything going for it. Above the garage, to attract their first daughter in off the road once Val got her driver’s license, a storage area had been outfitted with soft furniture, a mini-kitchen, and music, including a fairly decent drum set. Now that Val’s friends in her band, String of Pearls, were off in their first year of college — including Val, whose precise destination had been unresolved until late summer — Sally and her own friends used the soundproof room for the sports channel or MTV, taking utterly for granted the privilege it represented. Yes, he knew how old he sounded. Well? He felt old. <p>    He knew too much, so for instance he couldn’t simply drive down Euclid Avenue on an early April Wednesday morning without noting like a guidebook that it started out an Indian trail, which then became a stagecoach route. Streetcar tracks ran down the center of the street as once, before World War II, a hundred kinds of cars were manufactured here in Cleveland, where the steering wheel and the attached horn and windshield wipers were invented. The corner of Euclid and the street named for the city’s distinguished former mayor Carl Stokes — Euclid and Stokes — was the site of the country’s first hand-operated traffic signal, a device invented by another African- American Clevelander named Garrett Morgan. One block over, stretching along Carnegie for sixteen blocks, was the fourth- best hospital in the world, the Cleveland Clinic, which was the city’s largest single private employer, of more than eight thousand. “Thank you, Moses Cleaveland, our fine city’s esteemed founder,” his girls teased him when in their opinion he sounded like the Chamber of Commerce. <p>    “Seriously, look around you,” he’d refute them, without having to mention the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Every now and then he wished he had some out-of-town relatives to show around and show the place off to: “First there was the Indian trail, and now there’s the World Series champion baseball team of the same name.” <p>    So by the time he got downtown, Judge Gregory Brennan had cheered himself up considerably with the honest history of this city where he’d been born and had outlived a lot, not the least his own stubborn fears. Now his chambers were located in the modern Justice Center, across the street from the original Cuyahoga County Court House he would always prefer. There was no thrill equal to the experience of climbing those front steps each morning between the paired seated statues of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton and then, inside, gaining reinforcement from no less than Aristotle, whose words were carved into the marble — “and the rule of the law is preferable to any individual” — for none to avoid. Here in the Justice Center, uplift took the mundane form of elevators. <p>    “Good morning, Judge,” Marjorie McCarthy greeted him from her secure place behind her massive oak desk. When he responded, as always, “Good morning, Marge,” she corrected him, “Call me Esquire from now on,” to which Gregory could only ask, “Pardon me?” <p>    “I’ve decided I’m going to become a lawyer too.” But she had to look away from him so she wouldn’t ruin her own joke. <p>    Gregory stared at the brass nameplate on her desk, as if to attempt to conjure the adjustment. The old courthouse was being restored so faithfully it was difficult to believe anything beautiful had the power to change. The dense terracotta paint was being mixed according to the original formula, and the brown leather on the padded swinging doors, though new, was identical to what it replaced. By the door to his chambers, and by each judge’s, had stood the ribcage-high nameplate that looked like a miniature gas pump dressed up with brass flourishes, including back-to-back C’s signifying Cuyahoga County, or as Audrey teased him — though never Marjorie — Coco Chanel. He’d had to leave all that behind, moving into the twenty-four-story granite cube of the new Justice Center. No, he couldn’t begin to imagine losing Marjorie too, on top of Rob. <p>    He was unable to meet her eyes because — now she would be as shocked as he was — his eyes were filling with tears. If she ever quit, so would he. And now he saw he was serious. Still, he had to come up with something to answer, so he told her the truth: “I’m sorry to have to tell you how very sorry I am to hear that,” which caused Marjorie to chime, “April Fool!” Her own day had begun with a series of fake disaster calls from her nephews, so this seemed tame. <p>    Gregory sat in the armchair beside her desk and broke the rules for a second by taking her hand in his own. “As you know,” he told her, “I’ve always thought you would have made an excellent lawyer. But don’t ever leave me, please,” he begged her. “Promise?” <p>    Marjorie said, “Only on a stretcher.” This she regretted as well, since it was the awful way Judge Wallace left, when he left. <p>    Before Gregory could respond, she said, “But Judge Wallace’s wife — widow — called already this morning to thank you for inviting her boys to do something with you on Saturday morning. She said to say that they’d love to, and you only need to tell her what time.” Her approval was evident in her sweet smile. “What time shall I tell her for you?” <p>    “Nine? Ten?” <p>    “Nine. My nephews would already have been up for hours.” <p>    “Okay. Thanks.” Gregory pushed against the arms of the oak chair and stood over Marjorie. “You see how much I need you, Marge, don’t you?” <p>    At his own desk Gregory turned his back on the present and, like the restoration project, returned to the past to take guidance. Maybe it was time to retire. His own mentor, Judge Osborne, had taken cases on assignment from the Ohio Supreme Court until his death at eighty, but Gregory’s own expectation had been that he’d run for one more six-year term and call it quits. Now he wondered about forgoing that last term. Swiveling in his leather chair, he looked out his window and over the roof of the old courthouse to the Burke Lakefront Airport and a little plane climbing into the air like a squirrel up a tree. The future provided inspiration far better than the past: why not make that postponed trip to Paris to celebrate Audrey’s fiftieth birthday? Or why not take her off in a new direction — to Martinique, say — or, like Gauguin, who stopped in Martinique for five months, keep on going all the way to Tahiti? Maybe he could take up painting too and, like Gauguin, suppress the third dimension. For this recent canceled trip to Paris, he’d once again renovated his French. Why not retire? <p>    Gregory and Audrey often compared their work, law and medicine both being self-contained worlds — with hierarchies, yes, but this wasn’t the point — that existed for only one purpose. People passed through the systems of medicine and law to get help, and it was a privilege, as he and Audrey would agree even on their worst days, to provide it. They were like Noah and his wife, transporting the survivors. <p>    But his hands were shaking, so he held each with the other as his pulse jumped. That he might retire early was an idea he’d never had, except in relation to other people. There was Judge Osborne’s powerful example, never to quit entirely, but then there was his own father, who’d hit a tree at such a high speed it wasn’t termed an accident. The night of the crash, the police spared the widow and her two boys the most telling detail — no skid marks on the road — when delivering the news. Gregory then became the obsessively studious son of a father who had been a failure at everything but his own death, who died too young to set him any example but the wrong one. <p>“Please approach the bench,” Gregory instructed both attorneys as, off the record, he accused the defense of stalling. “Am I clear?” <p>    “Yes, Your Honor.” They sounded like identical twins. <p>    Jury selection was moving so slowly even Gregory had trouble staying with it. To the young lawyers he counseled, he often compared being a judge with his having been a catcher as a boy: if you lost your concentration behind the plate, you were to blame for any subsequent error. It could happen in the courtroom as out on the baseball diamond, and now he wished he could tell the jurors that, if they were bored, it wasn’t their fault. <p>    “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, rotating in his chair to address them, “I’ve asked counsel to refrain from needless and bothersome interruptions, so we will proceed with the jury selection process and begin the trial after the recess. You have been exceedingly patient with our sometimes tedious justice system.” He turned back and ordered, “Proceed,” which obliged counsel to reply, “Thank you, Your Honor.” <p>    But when court resumed, the first witness to be called by the state seemed to be missing from those gathered in the hall outside the courtroom. Gregory extended his arm and pointed it at the defense as if holding a zigzag bolt of lightning. Both lawyers stepped forward again, the one insisting it was a simple misunderstanding, whereas the prosecutor argued that while there were indeed other witnesses to be called, the girlfriend was crucial. The vehicular homicide case against her boyfriend was based on her grand jury testimony, where she’d described driving the defendant’s car when he grabbed the steering wheel during an argument, causing her to lose control. There was no point in the judge’s saying “Find her. Get her in here,” but it seemed to Gregory that he had no other real option. In a baseball game there could be a rain delay, when both players and spectators would have to wait, often hours, while it was decided whether or not to call the game. To the jurors he made this analogy as a way to let them know the case would continue. The large modern windows with their panoramic lake views were sealed against any and all weather, but you could see freighters make their way from one destination to the next, the way he himself always had. <p>    During the lunch break, this being Wednesday, Gregory went as usual to get his shoes polished. Joe Ricci was a guy who’d also worked the marble courthouse halls his whole career. A dedicated Indians fan — “But who isn’t these days,” he’d say, “when it’s easy” — he made shoes shine like new cars in a showroom. Some of the younger ones out there relied on paper shields to protect the socks — “Would you believe what people will pay for socks these days?” — but Joe was old school, a real pro. His brother Frank ran the barber shop — “From top to bottom, right, Judge?” — because they knew that the justice system remained the kind of workplace — “One of the few left, am I right?” — where people would still attempt to look as good as they could. Where they had to. Where their lives depended on it. <p>    “You’re looking good, Judge.” <p>    “You too, Joe.” Or, “You too, Frank.” <p>    “How’s everything?” <p>    “Good. And you?” <p>    “Good too.” <p>    Their talk never got more personal than that, except the week Joe and Frank’s mother passed away and each of them mentioned the fact, as then Gregory did around the time his mother died. And when they talked about — while avoiding — the death of Judge Wallace. <p>    Today was a little different, because Gregory was more tired than usual. As he sat impassively and watched Joe Ricci labor over his shoes, he felt like the professional loser he’d already been, in personal terms, when he arrived at work this morning and missed Marjorie’s April Fools’ Day joke on him. At least he’d had the idea of bringing Rob’s boys in on Saturday morning for haircuts. But this was an exception to the day’s lapses. It was almost as if, in the absence of testimony by the key witness, the jury could find against him instead. For insufficient everything. <p>    But he’d never liked being taken by surprise, so he was frustrated that the prosecutor appeared to have been manipulated by a witness who had suddenly become reluctant. She’d told the grand jury that the defendant, her boyfriend, had been screaming at her when he grabbed the wheel, causing her to swerve into the oncoming car, in which the driver had been killed. Clearly, her version of the events was crucial in order for a charge of vehicular homicide to be brought against the defendant. Gregory shifted in his seat, knowing how hard it was to ascribe state of mind.
