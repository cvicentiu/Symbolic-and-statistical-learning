  <title>Frequently Asked Questions about Virtualpolitik</title>
</head>
<body>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><i><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FAQ about
Virtualpolitik by
Elizabeth Losh</span></span><br>
<br>
What is
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtualpolitik</span>?</i> <br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">The<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Realpolitik </span>of Virtual
Institutions . . . by this I mean the way that decision-making for
public policy about the Internet is dictated not by
transcendent ideals but by <span style="font-weight: bold;">practical,
proximate interests</span>.&nbsp; So studying <i>Virtualpolitik</i>
involves looking at pre-existing rhetorical and
interpretive conventions from traditional institutions of
knowledge.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Why should it matter?</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Traditional <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">institutions of knowledge</span> like <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">universities</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">libraries</span>, and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">government agencies</span> often seem
to be in conflict about changes created by an information revolution
they claim to champion.&nbsp; Part of this can be explained by the fact
that individual public institutions can contain many <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">different cultures</span> and that these
cultures reflect <span style="font-weight: bold;">particular ideologies</span>
about concepts like "freedom" or "honesty" (as in "academic freedom" or
"academic
honesty") that are in turn shaped by factors like national, linguistic,
or theological identity, societal attitudes about ownership and
authorship, and cultural categories of gender, race, and class.<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who
should care?<br>
</span><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Anyone interested
in 21st century
<span style="font-weight: bold;">rhetoric, politics, hermeneutics, or
epistemology</span> should be interested
in these conflicts between different stakeholders about how to manage
the presentation of and access to public
information via the Internet.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
When you talk about conflict, what
theorists does this work on Virtualpolitik draw upon?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">I am interested
in
theories about <span style="font-weight: bold;">conflicts in social
networks</span> that are described by Karl Marx, <span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">J&uuml;rgen</span> Habermas,
Gregory Bateson, and Manuel Castells.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I also
like
to look at nuts-and-bolts public policy work by Christine Borgman, Siva
Vaidhyanathan, Lawrence Lessig, and Eric S. Raymond (along with other
champions of the
"open source" movement).<br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Is this theory about Virtualpolitik limited to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">recent</span> societal changes created by<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> human-computer interactions</span> or the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">social impact of computing</span>?&nbsp; Is
that what you mean by "information revolution"?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Not really,
although research done in these areas is important for this work.&nbsp;
I would argue that there is also a longer rhetorical history to
consider.<br>
<br>
First, human beings created <span style="font-weight: bold;">virtual
environments</span> long before Plato
described his cave in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic</span>.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Second, our way of thinking about information (as distinct from
knowledge) was already changing two centuries ago when people like
Thomas Bayes and the Marquis of Condorcet were proposing that our
<span style="font-weight: bold;">commonsense
beliefs about "chance" and "probability"</span> might be flawed.&nbsp;</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
What is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> information</span>?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Information, as
it is defined in Claude Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of
Communication," is fundamentally associated with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">uncertainty</span>.&nbsp; The quantity of
information conveyed has to do with the quantity of initial uncertainty
at issue.&nbsp; Shannon's
collaborator, Warren Weaver has said that information has "nothing to
do with meaning," although it does describe a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pattern</span>.&nbsp; This is because
information refers
not to a single message, but
<span style="font-weight: bold;">probabilistically</span> to an entire
set of possible messages.  In contrast to Shannon, Norbert Wiener argued for a <b>teleological</b> interpretation of information and insisted that information should properly be defined as <b>negative entropy</b>&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">How is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">information</span> different from<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> knowledge</span>?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">In his
theoretical
work, Michel Foucault characterizes knowledge as a traditional form of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">power</span>.&nbsp; Specific disciplines
constitute their authority by making prohibitions on access to
knowledge and by asserting their privilege (or license) to disseminate
or distribute particular <span style="font-weight: bold;">known facts</span>.&nbsp;
Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard has argued that
traditional institutions of
knowledge, epitomized by Humboldt's model of university,are threatened
by the conditions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">postmodernity</span>
as established disciplines encounter "noise in the system."&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">What
is <span style="font-weight: bold;">knowledge work</span>?<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Alan Liu presents
the business paradigm of "knowledge work" in which "cool" "style" becomes both a mark of resistance and a marker of defeat.&nbsp; Insidious caste systems between
"knowledge workers" and "information workers," like those
John Seely Brown describes, may mean that this privileged designation of cultural capital is yet
another manifestation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Virtualpolitik</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><br>
What
is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> literacy</span>?<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">James Paul Gee
defines literacy as the control of the uses of language in discourses
for <span style="font-weight: bold;">social institutions</span> beyond
the family.&nbsp; He says that literacies were therefore always <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">plural</span>.&nbsp; He also asserts that
such
Discourse functions as an "identity kit" that comes "complete with the
appropriate costume and instructions about how to act, talk, and often
write, so as to take on a particular role that others will
recognize."&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, literacy is about much <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more than mere decoding</span> and often
involves complex social practices of participation and recognition. <br>
<br>
Families, of course, also play an important role in literacy,
particularly if family members participate in what Shirley Brice Heath
has called "literacy events."&nbsp; However, the Internet has created
new forms of association and new definitions of "home" for people who
participate in global distributed networks.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><br>
What is <span style="font-weight: bold;">information literacy</span>?<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Many
universities have instituted information literacy requirements, based
on the work of researchers who study practices of information retrieval
and how sources of information are evaluated.&nbsp; The ALA defines
information literacy as "the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
information to become independent life-long learners" but also
recognizes that it includes many kinds of literacy:&nbsp; "tool
literacy,"&nbsp; "resource literacy," "social-structural
literacy,"&nbsp; "research literacy," and "publishing literacy."&nbsp;
Even the most ambitious programs endorsed by librarians may not be up
to the task, however, since information literacy is grounded in a long
history of complex social practices.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><br>
How is <span style="font-weight: bold;">literacy</span> different from<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> numeracy</span>?<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Many
universities have also instituted numeracy requirements.&nbsp; Like
literacy, numeracy involves participation in complex social practices
and is a much more rhetorical activity than the conventional
understanding of numeracy as a&nbsp; simple decoding of
mathematical symbols and functions might suggest.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
(Descartes famously wanted to integrate literacy and numeracy in his
dream of a unified field of knowledge characterized by a
single set of abstract symbols free of indeterminacy.)<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">What does it mean to talk about "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the social life of information</span>"?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">This
phrase, from a book by John Seely Brown and Paul Deguid describes the
importance of the "social periphery" of the digital world that includes
"the communities, organizations, and institutions that frame human
activities."&nbsp; They also consider the possibility that "information
overload" may be a recent cultural myth designed to limit choices in
ways that benefit corporate entities.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">What is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">information
theory</span>?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Information
theory is a field in information and computer science that includes
many theoretical endeavors like game theory or signal theory that
humanists are interested in as well.&nbsp; Information theory offers <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mathematical theories of communication</span>
and explains the <span style="font-weight: bold;">effects of entropy</span>
in information systems.<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">How are new <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">institutions of information</span> shaped
by traditional <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutions of
knowledge</span>?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">Distance
education and digital libraries are still closely allied to their
origins in traditional institutions of knowlege.&nbsp; I don't think we
have really begun to build institutions of information yet. <br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why
do you write about <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutional
websites</span> so much?&nbsp; Aren't governmental websites too
bureaucratic and anonymous&nbsp; to be expressive of any meaningful ethos
or reflect genuine rhetorical exchanges in the public sphere?<br>
<br>
</span></span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;">A recent book, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Language of Websites</span>
(Routledge, 2005), essentially asserts this position and claims that
institutional websites are still too close to traditional print.&nbsp;
The author, Mark Boardman, argues that personal websites are the site
of the "real publishing revolution."&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think many
people overlook the complexity and density of many institutional sites.
There is plenty
of subversive content on institutional websites: one can find
everything from Bertolt Brecht poems to Al Jazeera transcripts
on websites from the federal government. Based on my own
research, I would argue that institutions are characterized by
ideological tensions and battles between competing stakeholders: that's
what makes them of interest to me as a rhetorician.<br>
<p>Websites
are expected to do a lot more than simply provide PR for an
institution: they provide reports, speeches, hearings, open letters,
and even certain statistics that are mandated by law to be disclosed.
And even when authorship of a policy document appears to be masked by
an
anonymous collective of bureaucracy, embedded code can contain
information about its rhetorical and compositional history.&nbsp; Many
institutions feel obliged to publish materials about scandals or
disasters on their websites.&nbsp; And the whole genre of apologies on
institutional websites is fascinating.</p>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is
digital culture really so different from traditional culture?&nbsp;
There are centuries of cultural practices around <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">visual rhetoric</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">peer-to-peer networks</span>, even in
public spheres built around classical oratory or other hierarchical
forms of social organization?<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The
authors represented in a recent book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Making
Things Public: Atmospheres of Democracy</span> (MIT Press, 2005) often
seem to make this argument.&nbsp; I would tend to agree that new
digital genres often borrow from older genres from print and oral
culture.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> &nbsp; </span></span><br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
What is the main <span style="font-weight: bold;">argument</span> of
this book-in-progress?</span><br>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-right: -27pt; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 40px; font-family: georgia;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-right: -27pt; text-indent: 0.5in; font-family: georgia;">Digital
rhetoric,
much like computer science, provides an interpretive framework that
encompasses
much more than the study of hardware or software.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet
many who purportedly study the rhetoric
of digital discourse focus excessively on the technological apparatus,
so that
a conventional view of the study of hypertext and networked
communication directs
attention to the computer rather than the theory behind it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the standard model of digital rhetoric,
represented by journals like <i style="">Kairos</i>
and <i style="">Computers and Composition</i>,
literary theory is almost always applied to technological applications
without
considering how technological theories could conversely elucidate
literary
texts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rhetoricians of digital culture
debate about the merits of MOO&#8217;s and MUD&#8217;s or blogs and wikis but
rarely
address how fundamental paradigms of the public sphere have been
reshaped by
certain new ideas from the discourses of codes and algorithms.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-family: georgia;">This
is partly because<i style="">
information</i> is still largely treated in the Humanities as being
synonymous
with knowledge, even though information &#8211; in its technical sense &#8211; is
defined
by information theorists as a construct of uncertainty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Traditional disciplines that rely on
syllogistic or probabilistic reasoning promulgate initiatives for
&#8220;information
literacy&#8221; without recognizing a departure from the conventional
knowledge-acquisition model or considering how competing
definitions of information dating back to Claude Shannon of Bell Labs and Norbert
Wiener
of MIT have created the conditions for a paradigm shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aristotle may be rebuked by contemporary rhetoricians for
his taxonomic approach to discourse, while a rhetoric based on equally
antiquated Aristotilean notions of probability still holds sway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This opposition between
information and knowledge
has important philosophical ramifications, since these competing
ideologies
have shaped the history of communication since at least the 4th century
B.C.E.
when, as Dilip Gaonkar explains, &#8220;Aristotle replaces Plato&#8217;s binary
opposition
between reality and appearance with his own binary opposition between
the
necessary and the contingent.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the<o:p></o:p>
epistemological
positions of the two ancients, it seems to follow that Plato is the<o:p></o:p>
consummate
philosopher of knowledge, and Aristotle is the philosopher of
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, I would locate the
new divide
between the &#8220;two cultures&#8221; of academia much less neatly than C.P. Snow,
because
information science has created new circuits of disciplinary exchange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-right: -27pt; text-indent: 0.5in; font-family: georgia;">At
the same
historical moment, the transformation of traditional institutions by
digital
media in networked societies has been hyped with utopian or dystopian
narratives about a new public culture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet many public institutions &#8211; universities, libraries, and
government
agencies &#8211; have created virtual counterparts with many of the same
rhetorical
conventions or inverse forms of those very same rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the discourses of institutions
of information often function like those of the traditional
institutions of
knowledge that they emulate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Specifically, I argue that traditional ideologies of
nationalism,
private property, and linguistic identity are often replicated in
digital
culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These new online institutions
are also governed by a principle that I call <i style="">Virtualpolitik</i>
&#8211; the pragmatic, provisional politics of virtual institutions
responding to competing interests that are no longer separated by time
and
space.</p>
