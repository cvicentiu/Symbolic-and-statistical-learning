Forthe past 15 years, she has been active in library and informationscience, communication, and computer science. In a recent studyof faculty productivity in her field, Borgman was ranked secondmost productive scholar and eighth most cited in the field forher scholarly journal articles. <BR><P> Her research interests lie in theareas of human-computer interaction, digital libraries, scholarlycommunication, and bibliometrics. Her current research focuseson information technology and policy issues in the developmentof computing networks and automated library services in Centraland Eastern Europe. <BR><P> Since 1990, Borgman has lecturedor conducted research in 18 countries, including Croatia, Hungary,Italy and Australia. She is a Visiting Professor in the Departmentof Information and Library Studies at Loughborough Universityin England, a three-year position ending in 1999. <BR><P> Borgman holds a Ph.D. in communicationfrom Stanford University, having earned her master's of libraryscience at the University of Pittsburgh and her B.A. in mathematicsfrom Michigan State University. Prior to her research career,she was a systems analyst, developing automated systems for librariesand information retrieval systems for industry. She has been amember of the UCLA faculty since 1983. <BR><P> She is an elected Fellow of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science and a memberof the Board of Directors of the Council on Library and InformationResources, the Advisory Board to the Soros Foundation Open SocietyInstitute Regional Library Program, the Advisory Board to theElectronic Privacy Information Center, and the Association forComputing Machinery Public Policy Committee. <BR><P> &quot;Professor Borgman's researchand teaching epitomize the interdisciplinary ideals for whichthe Presidential Chair program was created,&quot; said GSE&amp;ISActing Dean Eva Baker, who along with the library and informationscience faculty, recommended Borgman for the honor. &quot;Herresearch draws upon theories, methods and practice of multipledisciplines, and involves the collaboration of scholars and studentsfrom multiple departments and programs.&quot;<BR><P> Borgman said her first order ofbusiness as Presidential Chair is to finish a long-delayed bookon access to information in the networked world, due out nextyear from MIT Press. She then plans to use the extra time andfunds the chair affords her to launch new projects. <BR><P> The chair, she said, is &quot;agreat personal honor, but I think perhaps more important is therecognition it represents for the program at UCLA.&quot; Borgmanserved as department chair &quot;during an exciting time of transitionand transformation.&quot; Now a department in UCLA's GraduateSchool of Education &amp; Information Studies, &quot;we've repositionedourselves as a truly interdisciplinary information studies program,playing a very important role in a larger graduate school at amajor research university.&quot; Borgman's Presidential Chairis the only known university-level endowed chair presently heldin the field in the United States. <BR><P> The University of California establishedits Presidential Chair program in 1981 to encourage new or interdisciplinaryprogram development and as a way of enhancing quality in existingacademic programs. The program began with nine chairs -- one foreach of the UC campuses -- and since has expanded on some campuses.Borgman is one of four sitting Presidential Chair holders at UCLA.<BR><P><CENTER>-UCLA-</CENTER><p><P></B><P><P align=right><A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gseis.ucla.edu?subject=Comments%20about%20<!--#echo var='HTTP_HOST'--><!--#echo var='REQUEST_URI'-->">updated <!--#config timefmt="%D"--><!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"--></A></P></BODY></HTML>
