Ware (Ph.D., Princeton University, 1951) is a senior computer       scientist emeritus with the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California.       An electrical engineer, he has devoted his career to all aspects of computer       technology &#8211; hardware, software, architectures, software development,       networks, federal agency and military applications, management of computer-intensive       projects, public policy and legislation. He chaired a Department of Defense committee in the late 1960s that created       the first definitive discussion of information system security and treated       it as both a technical matter and a policy issue. Later, in the early 1970s       he chaired the cabinet-level &quot;HEW committee&quot; whose report was       the foundation for the United States Federal Privacy Act of 1974. Subsequently,       President Gerald Ford appointed him to the Privacy Protection Study Commission       whose report remains the most extensive examination of private sector record-keeping       practices. Most recently his interests have turned to the vulnerabilities       of highly automated and computerized information-oriented societies, and       the technical and policy aspects of protecting their national information       infrastructure. Dr. Ware is the first and past chairman of the (U.S.) Information System       and Privacy Advisory Board, which he chaired for eleven years following       its creation. It is a statutory body created by the Computer Security Act       of 1987 and advises the United States government on societal impacts of       computer technology and broad aspects of the government's information system       infrastructure.</FONT><HR></TD></TR>          </TABLE></TD></TR>      <TR>         <TD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><STRONG><A name="wolfson"></A><A href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/paul_wolfson" target="_blank">Paul Wolfson</A></STRONG><STRONG>, Counsel, <A href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/" target="_blank">Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP</A></STRONG></FONT></TD></TR>      <TR>         <TD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG src="wolfson.jpg" alt="Paul Wolfson" width="80" height="107" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="left">           Paul Wolfson has a Supreme Court and appellate practice at the Washington,       D.C. law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP.
