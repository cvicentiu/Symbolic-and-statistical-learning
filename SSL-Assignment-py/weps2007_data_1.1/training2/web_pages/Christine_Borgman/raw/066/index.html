"UCLA Professor Christine Borgman has been appointed to the University of
California's Presidential Chair in Information Studies, which she will hold
for five years.  UC President Richard Atkinson approved establishment of
the endowed chair specifically in honor of Borgman's distinguished career
and in recognition of the growing importance and interdisciplinary nature
of her field.

"In his letter of congratulations to Borgman, UCLA Chancellor Albert
Carnesale noted that her interdisciplinary research is "at the nexus of
information technology, information-related behavior and information policy
(which) is an important area where innovative activities will be taking
place on this campus...Your appointment to this endowed chair honors your
creative contributions to UCLA as well as nationally and internationhally,
in this field."
