<font color="#2765b4"><b>Tutorial 1a: Evaluating Digital Libraries for Usability
<br>
(Christine Borgman: Univ. of California, Los Angeles, USA)
</b></font>

<p>
Usability is a fuzzy concept, as usability depends so much on context.  A
digital library that is usable by one set of users for a given set of uses
may not be very usable by a different set of users with different uses.
This tutorial will focus on usability in context, specifically the
relationships between users, uses, and usability.
</p>

<p>
Much of the tutorial will be devoted to research methods for conducting
formative, iterative, and summative evaluation of digital libraries.
Because research methods are difficult to explain in the abstract, we will
illustrate them with examples drawn from the Alexandria Digital Earth
Prototype (ADEPT) Project.  ADEPT is a 5-year project (1999-2004) to design
geo-spatial digital libraries for use in undergraduate education.  We are
conducting a series of evaluation studies that incorporate quantitative and
qualitative methods drawn from information studies, education, and
psychology.  The lessons learned from ADEPT apply to a wide variety of
digital library applications.

<font color="#2765b4"><b>Tutorial 1b: Knowledge Management Systems: A Text Mining Perspective
<br>
(Hsinchun Chen: Univ. of Arizona, USA)
</b></font>

<p>This tutorial aims to present a balanced and integrated view of what
a Knowledge Management System (KMS) is. We first define Knowledge
Management (KM) from various consulting and IT perspectives and then
pay particular attention to new and emerging technologies that help
promote this new field. In particular, we present a review of some key
KMS sub-fields: search engines, data mining, and text mining. We hope
to help readers better understand the emerging technologies behind
knowledge management, i.e., Knowledge Management Systems. A high-level,
although systematic, discussion of text mining is presented. Unlike
search engines and data mining that have a longer history and are
better understood, text mining is an emerging technical area that is
relatively unknown to IT professionals. We therefore present several
case studies and conclude with lessons learned and future research and
development directions. This tutorial is intended to provide a gentle
introduction to researchers and IT professionals who are new to KMS. We
hope to provide a non-technical and practical review of this
fascinating field and the potential and pitfalls of this type of
emerging technology.
