Winter 2007 <br>
Monday 1:30pm - 4:50pm, GSE&amp;IS room 111 <p>

This is an introductory and relatively nontechnical introduction to systems
analysis and design.  The main idea is that data modeling provides a language,
and that iterative design provides a process, with which designers and users
can articulate the functionality of a computer system. <p>

The only course prerequisites are those of the program in general, including
the programming requirement.  The course complements several other courses
in the program, including IS 240 (Management of Digital Records), IS 245
(Information Access), IS 260 (Information Structures), IS 270 (Introduction to
Information Technology), IS 272 (Human/Computer Interaction), IS 274 (Database
Management Systems), IS 276 (Information Retrieval Systems: Structures and
Algorithms), IS 277 (Information Retrieval Systems: User-Centered Designs),
and IS 464 (Metadata). <p>

The course has three parts.  The first part consists mostly of lectures and
discussion on the nature of design, including a fieldwork exercise. <p>

The second part concerns the two most important skills of systems analysis,
data modeling and process modeling.  Because data and process modeling are so
fundamental to the main tradition of system design, we will take time in class
to work examples of them. <p>

The third part will consist of a group design exercise.  Each group will get
its own design problem.  The groups will then iterate their designs, starting
at the most conceptual level and working over five weeks toward detailed
designs. <p>

This class, like most serious design classes, involves a significant amount
of group-oriented work outside of the weekly class meeting.  Although we
will attempt to assign students to groups based on the times when they are
available for group meetings, we cannot guarantee that group work will be
feasible for those whose weekly schedules are almost entirely filled with
other activities.  Because those people's scheduling issues will make life
difficult for the other students in their group, they should not enroll in
the class. <p>

Grades will consist of 15% for the fieldwork exercise, 15% for the take-home
process and data modeling assignment, and 70% for the group projects. <p>

There is no textbook.  There is, however, a reading from Pelle Ehn,
<i>Work-Oriented Design of Computer Artifacts</i>, second edition, Stockholm:
Arbetslivscentrum, 1989.  This is on reserve in the lab.  There is also a
reading packet, available from the LuValle Commons bookstore. <p>

The reader includes two chapters from a conventional systems analysis and
design textbook: Jeffrey A. Hoffer, Joey F. George, and Joseph S. Valacich,
<i>Modern Systems Analysis and Design</i>, third edition, Upper Saddle
River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.  The book as a whole is not required for the
course because (like all of the textbooks on the subject that we have read) 
it is far too expensive for the amount of intellectual substance it includes.
If you want a conventional systems analysis textbook, many used copies of
this book (many of them probably earlier editions) are available cheaply on
the Web.  One good site for used books is
&lt;<a href = http://www.addall.com/Used/>http://www.addall.com/Used/</a>&gt;.
Another reasonably good textbook for which used copies are available cheaply
is Jeffrey L. Whitten, Lonnie D. Bentley, and Kevin C. Dittman, <i>Systems
Analysis and Design Methods</i>, sixth edition, Boston: Irwin McGraw-Hill,
1998. <p>

Reading assignment for the first class.  Historically, there have been
roughly two types of design, engineering design that proceeds linearly from
requirements to supposedly optimal solutions and a more artistic form of
design, for example in architecture, that places much more emphasis on the
early phases of conceptualizing and reconceptualizing the design before the
more detailed phases of design begin.  Computer systems have generally been
designed using design methods from engineering.  In recent years, however, the
engineering and artistic varieties of design have increasingly been combined.
Class readings will therefore be drawn from both varieties.  To get a sense
of the more artistic variety of design, all students should read, before the
first class meeting, the October 2002 issue of the design magazine Metropolis.
The article about IDEO's information design project at a hospital is
especially useful, but the rest of the issue, including articles about the
Queens library and the Getty, is worth reading as well.  Ask yourself what
it would be like to design computers in the ways that these articles describe.
The issue is on reserve in the lab.  It is also available by mail for $8.95 a
copy from Back Issues, Metropolis, 61 West 23rd St, New York NY 10010, or fax
(212) 627-9988.  They take checks or Amex/Visa/Mastercard. <p>

The rest of the reading assignments in this syllabus should be done after the
class for which they are listed.  So, for example, read Brand's article after
the first week's lecture on design.  The same applies to assignments number 1
and 2, which are due in weeks 5 and 6, respectively. <p>
