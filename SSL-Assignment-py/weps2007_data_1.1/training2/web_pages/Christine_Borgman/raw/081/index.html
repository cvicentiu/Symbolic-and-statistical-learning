		<h1>Automation Reasonings</h1>
		<p>In her article &quot;From Acting Locally to Thinking Globally&quot; (1997), Christine Borgman outlined several of the issues involved in the decision of whether or not to automate a library.  Although the reasons to automate or not have changed over the years, many are still as applicable today as they were forty years ago when the automation of library functions began.</p>
		<hr />
		<h3>Reasons To Automate</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>STAGE I -- Efficiency of Internal Operations</dt>
				<dd>As LISes came to libraries in the 1960s and 1970s, the primary reason to automate was to streamline internal operations ... to do &quot;more&quot; with &quot;less&quot;.  Libraries were experiencing a labor force that included fewer professional librarians as well as fewer staff overall.  Efficiency could also be measured in the reduction of time associated with an item's arrival to when it appeared on a shelf.  Given these activities, the focus of automation efforts was on &quot;core&quot; library operations: circulation control, acquisitions procedures, serials processing, and cataloging.<br /><br />
				This stage addresses:<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Internal Workflow<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Sharing Cataloging Data<br /><br /></dd>
			<dt>STAGE II -- Access to Local Resources</dt>
				<dd>The 1980s and 1990s saw the LIS and automation enable increased and enhanced access to local resources.  Patrons were better able to know what a library had or didn't have in its collections.  Search capabilities (algorithms) of online catalogs (OPACs) were a focus as researchers attempted to develop better, faster, etc., information retrieval techniques.<br /><br />
				This stage addresses:<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> IOLS Marketplace<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs)<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Retrospective Conversion of Bibliographic Records<br /><br /></dd>
			<dt>STAGE III -- Access to Outside Resources</dt>
				<dd>Beginning in the 1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web and the globally-connected Internet infrastructure, libraries began to focus on increasing and enhancing access to materials housed in <i>other</i> library collections.  Borgman points out the &quot;three developments in access to resources outside the library...&quot; as being:<br />
					&raquo;New means of identifying, locating, and obtaining documents; [Document Delivery, Interlibrary Loan/Lending]<br />
					&raquo;Direct online exchange of data; [Direct transfer of bibliographic records between bibliographic utilities (OCLC) and the local automation system.]<br />
					&raquo;Integrating local collections with other types of information sources; [Access to non-book resources such as CDs, audiovisual materials, Web sites, documents, etc.]&quot; (p. 225)<br /><br />
		 		This stage addresses:<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Document Delivery Services<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Online Data Exchange (Z39.50)<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Integrated Online Resources (mounting DBs onto OPAC)<br />
				<b>&raquo;</b> Web Resources<br /><br /></dd>
			<dt>STAGE IV -- Integration and Interoperability of Systems and Services</dt>
				<dd>Libraries continue to look for ways to integrate resources and services.  Interoperability is defined as the ability to exchange data seamlessly between computer systems.  This can be accomplished by adhering to more recently-developed standards such as MARC and Z39.50, an online data exchange protocol.  Today, libraries are investigating how to integrate the online catalog with other electronic resources such as online databases and search engines.  With this integration we see a transformation of access points/mechanisms as well as the formal definition of a library &quot;collection&quot;.<br /><br />

				<b>&raquo;</b> Digital Libraries<br /><br /></dd>

		<h3>Reasons Not To Automate</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Cost</dt>
				<dd>Library Information Systems are costly, in terms of financial capital as well as human capital.  Today's LISes can cost somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to implement and maintain per year.  Many libraries cannot afford the capital outlay.  Relatedly, personnel required to run and utilize the system are often hidden costs, especially when considering their training needs and job functions.<br /><br /></dd>
			<dt>Overall Purpose</dt>
				<dd>A library needs to consider why an automation system sould be useful.  Questions to consider include &quot;Will the system assist the library in becoming more efficient in its processing of materials?&quot;  ; &quot;When is an OPAC needed? How big of a collection do we have and would we be better able to organize and maintain it with a system?&quot; As the old adage goes, &quot;Just because you <i>can</i> do it, does not mean you <i>should</i> do it.&quot;<br /><br /></dd>
			<dt>Long-Term Commitment</dt>
				<dd>Given the costs associated with automation, libraries must consider the long-term commitment that accompanies automation.  Once a library takes the leap into automated systems, it is very difficult to reverse the decision and go back &quot;to the old ways&quot;.</dd>
