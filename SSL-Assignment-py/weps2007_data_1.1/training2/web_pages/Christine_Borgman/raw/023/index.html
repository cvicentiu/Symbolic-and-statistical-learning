<h1>Book Review</h1>

<p><strong>Borgman, Christine L</strong>. <i>From Gutenberg to the Global Information Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World</i>. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Pr., 2000. 324p. $42, alk. paper (ISBN 0-262-02473-x). LC 99-39906.</p>

<p>Few observers would disagree that the dissemination of information, and the role of libraries in it, are at a major crossroads, with few road signs pointing to the next destination. Print has reigned supreme for centuries, and before that, similar principles prevailed. In the 1950s and thereafter, microforms came briefly to steal part of the show, although more as a preservation and space-saving expedient than as a substitute for print. Despite exuberant predictions, microforms never played their predicted role; they were too inconvenient to use, were poorly indexed in public catalogs and on the reel, and never contributed much to saving shelf space because libraries seldom discarded the materials they &#8216;replaced.&#8217; In these instances, whatever the changes, they were relatively modest and never threatened the status of libraries as indispensable intermediaries between information and its seekers.</p>

<p>This is no longer the case. Cyberspace is, or at least is seen to be, as much nemesis of traditional libraries as benefactor. The reasons for this are all too obvious: convenience and efficiency are the two most often advanced. Christine Borgman&#8217;s study employs a wide canvass in presenting a <i>status questionis</i>. On the whole, Borgman steers a middle course between the Scylla of nostalgia and the Charybdis of futurism. She is especially careful to treat issues on a quid pro quo basis, scrupulously and systematically discussing both advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Borgman&#8217;s work is a tour d&#8217;horizon, and the scope is international. As a result, few topics can receive extended treatment, but a few discussions, though brief, seemed to be of special interest. These include her discussion of paper/electronics trade-offs; fee versus free; the perennial issue of what to preserve in the original (that is, when are books artifacts and when merely vehicles?); and &#8220;the politics of access.&#8221; Her last two chapters discuss prospects for a &#8220;global digital library,&#8221; a prospect that will incite fear in some and anticipation in others. Whatever the viewpoint, Borgman makes it clear that a wealth of initiatives is bringing the day closer. Another interesting thread is her attention to the value of digitization in preservation. Heretofore a Sisyphean labor, preservation promises to benefit greatly from any number of applications&#8212;and in many cases, just in time.</p>

<p>Despite her wide-ranging writ, there are two points that Borgman glosses over. She treats off-site storage only in passing, even though it could ultimately have as great an effect on library collections and access as the electronic world. It might easily serve as a greater incentive to digitization than other factors, for instance, by comparing the costs of the latter with those of new construction, document delivery, and the like. Nor has Borgman anything to say about the potential fiscal perils of replacing print with cyberspace. Whenever this is discussed, it is hard not to conjure up the parable of the spider and the fly. Not even the most ingenuous librarian can have failed to notice that information is the hottest commodity in the marketplace and it is being purveyed without the slightest vestige of altruism. We see very visible and unembarrassed moves toward monopolization, not only at the corporate level, but, more frighteningly, also at the format level. Who among us cannot foresee at least the possibility of being victimized by the kinds of monopolism that is impossible with print?</p>

<p>As Borgman points out, the distinguishing feature of libraries is that they house information, organize it consistently and continuously, and are constantly intent on providing effective access not only to those who come with a name, a subject, or an idea, but also to those who come to do nothing more than gather data on subjects they know little about. The Internet will not often modify the behavior of this last group, but a competent and enthusiastic librarian or two may have more than a fighting chance to do just that. It is considerably easier to walk away from a session on the Internet piqued, bemused, and befuddled, yet with the notion that the data have been domesticated&#8212;case closed.</p>

<p>One question is whether <i>From Gutenberg</i> will find a readership outside the profession. Even though Borgman addresses users, or at least their concerns, a certain abstractness about her discourse leaves a disembodied feeling. Discussions are usually cast at a rarefied level, and her arguments are seldom illumined by hypothetical case situations that would offer more immediacy. At no point does she wax passionate and thus her own position remains unclear. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in light of the failed predictions of the past, it might have been well to stake out a position, if only in a preface (there is none). For some, the great unknown is the ability&#8212;and the utility&#8212;of the mass of users to circumvent libraries and librarians on the cruise through the Internet. Some library users have always managed to do this, whatever the medium. The question, one that must remain hypothetical, is whether they were better off for it. Nowadays, the temptations to give the nearest library a pass are almost overwhelming. The tee-shirts that say &#8220;So Many Books, So Little Time&#8221; must be updated to &#8220;So Much Cyberspace, So Little Time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgman does a good job of embracing the future without forsaking the past. Along the way she sketches any number of issues that readers will want to know more about, which is always the sign of a stimulating work. In aid of this, she provides a substantial, up-to-date bibliography. She does not try to offer a range of solutions, realizing that the evidence is not up to that; but she does a fine job of bringing most of the issues together into a thought-provoking whole. In today&#8217;s kaleidoscopic world of information technology, no work can be timeless, but From Gutenberg promises to have a more extended shelf life than most.&#8212;<i>David Henige, University of Wisconsin at Madison.</i></p>
