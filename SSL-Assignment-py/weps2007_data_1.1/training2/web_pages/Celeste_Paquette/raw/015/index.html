<P><a name="1"><strong>OP-C-7-G1	EVALUATION OF A&amp;P AND USPS EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE</a></strong></P>

<P><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
It is the policy of Florida State University to communicate to <a href="glossary.html#AP">Administrative and Professional (A&amp;P)</a> and <a href="glossary.html#USPS">University Support Personnel System (USPS)</a> employees' job performance expectations and management's evaluation of the employee's job performance. Supervisors and managers should be forthright in their evaluations of employees, and the <a href="glossary.html#PerfEval">performance evaluation</a> process should be a constructive tool for continual improvement, documenting substandard performance, and recognition of employees' performance.</P>

<dl>
<dd><strong><a href="links.html#3G">SPECIFIC AUTHORITY</a></strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>Florida Administrative Code 6C-5.925
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>To specify the methods and responsibilities for conducting and reporting the performance evaluations of Administrative and Professional (A&amp;P) and University Support Personnel System (USPS) employees. A&amp;P and USPS employees must have their performance evaluated at least annually.  A&amp;P employee performance reviews should be completed to coincide with the employee's annual re-appointment.  USPS annual employees' performance reviews shall be completed within thirty (30) days following the annual date they were appointed to the class.
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>A.	PROCEDURES - EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
	<dl>
	<dd>1.	A&amp;P Evaluations
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>For A&amp;P employees, the documentation of the performance review may be done on the Review of Performance form or by official memorandum.  Management may develop their own performance review form, provided it is coordinated with the Human Resources and includes the standard rating levels as listed below:
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Excellent
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Above Satisfactory
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Satisfactory
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Unsatisfactory (or) Needs Improvement
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>A copy of the review will be provided to the employee and the original will be forwarded to the Human Resources Department to be filed in the employee's official personnel file.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>2.	University Support Personnel System (USPS) Evaluations
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>For USPS employees, the documentation of the performance review will be done on the USPS Performance Evaluation Form.  This policy provides a choice of two (2) forms: USPS Performance Evaluation by Exception or USPS Employee Performance Evaluation.  A copy of the review will be provided to the employee and the original will be forwarded to the employee's official personnel file.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The USPS Performance Evaluation by Exception is an annual review that verifies that no significant changes have occurred in performance, that a review discussion has taken place with the employee, and that the previous rating continues as indicated on the last evaluation.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The USPS Employee Performance Evaluation is used to document performance in more detail and to indicate changes that have occurred, or improvement required.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>USPS evaluations should be on the basis of total performance in fulfilling assigned responsibilities.  The USPS evaluation is to acknowledge performance, to communicate performance effectiveness, and to aid in improving performance in assigned duties.
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a.	USPS Performance Evaluation Ratings
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>An employee's performance shall be rated at one of the following rating levels:
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Superior Performance Standards (SPS): The employee's performance is consistently greater than the expected standards.  (4)
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Above Performance Standards (APS): The employee's performance is above the performance standards expected.  (3)
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Meets Performance Standards (MPS): The employee's performance meets the expected standards.  (2)
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Below Performance Standards (BPS): The employee's performance is below expected standards. (1)
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Types of USPS Evaluations of Employee Performance
		<dd>&nbsp;
			<dl>
			<dd>(1)	<a href="glossary.html#ProbEval">Probationary Evaluation</a>
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>A probationary evaluation is required for any probationary period defined in the SUS Employee Pay Plan.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>A probationary evaluation shall be completed within the thirty (30) days prior to the end of the probationary period for the designated class or prior to the end of any probationary period extension.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>The execution of more than one (1) evaluation during the probationary period is optional with the Division/Department.  A mid-term review is recommended for any appointments in which the employee is in probationary status.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>The probationary period may be extended up to six (6) months normally, in sixty (60) day intervals, when any of the following circumstances occur:
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>The employee is rated Below Performance Standards;
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>The supervisor decides that additional time is needed for appropriate training or on the job experience;
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>The employee or rater is granted an authorized leave of absence [other than military leave for the employee in accordance with Rule 6C-5.920(15)] during the probationary period.  The probationary period may be extended for the length of the period of an approved leave of absence; or
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An employee without permanent status in the current class is reassigned to a different position in the same class and makes a written request that the probationary period be extended for a period not to exceed six (6) months.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>A request for extending the probationary period requires the approval of the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources, or designee, and should be received in the Human Resources at least fourteen (14) days before the end of the probationary period to allow sufficient time to process the request for extension.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An employee serving a probationary period in the current class shall be removed from the class if his/her performance has not improved to the Meets Performance Standards level within the probationary period or extended period.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An employee who is on military leave, as described in Rule 6C-5.920(15), at the expiration of the probationary period shall be considered to have completed the probationary period with a Meets Performance Standards evaluation.  If an employee returns from military service prior to the expiration of the probationary period, the employee shall be required to complete the remainder of the probationary period.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>(2)	<a href="glossary.html#AnnEval">Annual Evaluation</a>
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An annual evaluation shall be completed for each employee having permanent status in the current class.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An employee shall receive an annual evaluation completed each year within thirty (30) days following the date the employee was appointed or returned to their current class unless the rating period is extended in accordance with the conditions stated above relative to the extension of the probationary period.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An annual evaluation of an employee who returned from military leave as described in Rule 6C-5.920(15), shall not include the time on military leave.  The employee's performance level while on military leave shall be considered to be at the same rating level as the employee's preceding evaluation.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>(3)	<a href="glossary.html#Special">Special Evaluation</a>
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>A special evaluation for an employee with permanent status may be completed at any time.  Whenever the rater determines that the employee's performance has changed from the rating level reflected on the most recent evaluation a special evaluation may be completed.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>When an employee's most recent evaluation is at the Meets Performance Standards level or higher and a special performance evaluation is completed, the rating period may cover the day after the last rating period to the date the evaluation is discussed with the employee.  The exception is when an employee's performance has dropped to Below Performance Standards level.  When a special performance evaluation is completed which is Below Performance Standards evaluation, the evaluation shall not cover more than a 60-day period immediately preceding the date the special evaluation is discussed with the employee.  See below for additional information concerning Below Performance Standards evaluations.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>(4)	<a href="glossary.html#BelPerf">Below Performance Standard Evaluation</a>
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>If an employee who has attained permanent status in the class receives a special evaluation of Below Performance Standards in accordance with this procedure, the rater, with cooperation of higher level Supervisors, shall communicate in writing to the employee a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) to assist in correcting the noted deficiencies.  The supervisor should contact Employee/Labor Relations for assistance in developing the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) prior to giving a Below Performance Standards rating. A Below Performance Standards rating must be accompanied by a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) when it is submitted to Human Resources.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>For those employees covered by an applicable collective bargaining agreement, an employee may be removed from the class no sooner than sixty (60) days after receipt of the performance improvement plan if adequate improvement in performance is not achieved.  Otherwise the employee may be removed from the class at any time if adequate improvement in performance is not achieved.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>An employee shall usually not remain at the Below Performance  Standards level for more than one hundred twenty (120) days, and as noted above may be removed from the class at any time if adequate improvement in performance is not achieved. Employees covered by an applicable collective bargaining agreement may be removed no sooner than sixty (60) days after receipt of the performance improvement plan.  If the employee's performance has not improved to at least Meets Performance Standards level within the designated improvement period(s), the University shall initiate action to remove the employee from the class.  Such action will normally be completed within forty-five (45) days of being initiated.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>Rating periods may be extended in accordance with the conditions stated above relative to the extension of the probationary period.
			<dd>&nbsp;
			</dl>

		<dd> c.	Absence of an Evaluation
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>In the absence of a required evaluation, the following shall apply:
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>For those employees who have not yet received an evaluation, the employee's rating shall be considered to be at the Meets Performance Standards level.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>For those employees with a previous evaluation in the class, the employee's performance shall be considered to be at the same level as the preceding evaluation, except when it is a Below Performance Standards rating then it shall be considered to be at the Meets Performance Standards level.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>An employee may make a written request for a performance evaluation to replace a rating received through the provisions above, within thirty (30) days following the original due date of the evaluation.  If an employee makes such a request, the rater shall complete the evaluation within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>d.	Additional Performance Evaluation Procedures
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The evaluation rating period shall cover the specific period shown on the evaluation form and will not cover a period not yet worked.  Only one (1) rating may be in effect for a specific period.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The rater, normally the employee's immediate supervisor, is primarily responsible for timely completion of the evaluation rating form and shall be held accountable for such evaluations.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The rater shall be the person regularly assigned to direct the work of the employee, or if unavailable, the person designated.  Such designation shall not conflict with a collective bargaining agreement.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The evaluation shall be reviewed by a higher level supervisor, whenever possible.  The higher level supervisor review is not required when the rating is completed by a Department Chair, Dean, Director, Assistant Vice President, Vice President or the President, unless otherwise required by departmental policy.  The rater's completed evaluation shall not be changed by the higher level supervisor, but the higher level supervisor may attach any written comments concerning the evaluation.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The performance evaluation shall be discussed with the employee, who shall be provided with information regarding the basis of the evaluation and given the opportunity to sign the evaluation.  The signature of the employee shall indicate only that the employee's performance and evaluation form have been discussed with the employee and does not imply that the employee agrees or disagrees with the evaluation.  If the employee does not agree with the evaluation, the employee may attach any written comments concerning the evaluation.  The original completed evaluation form and employee comments, if applicable, shall be placed in the employee's official personnel file.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>An evaluation is considered to be complete after it has been discussed with the employee and the rater has signed the evaluation form.

<P><a name="2"><strong>OP-C-7-G2 	COMPLAINT PROCEDURE, USPS AND A&amp;P</strong></a></P>

<P><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
It is the policy of Florida State University to provide <a href="glossary.html#USPS">University Support Personnel System (USPS)</a> and <a href="glossary.html#AP">Administrative and Professional (A&amp;P)</a> employees with an internal Complaint Procedure to provide a formal mechanism to bring complaints to the attention of management and to address those complaints.  There shall be no reprisals against any of the participants for participation in this Complaint Procedure.</P>

<P>An employee who has a <a href="glossary.html#Complaint">complaint</a> or grievance is encouraged to discuss with his or her supervisor the option of utilizing the University's Mediation Program that is administered by the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) prior to the filing of a formal complaint or <a href="glossary.html#Grievance">grievance</a>.  Additional information on the EAP Mediation Program may be obtained from the University's EAP Office.  Any request to hold the time limits for the filing of a complaint or grievance in abeyance must first be approved in writing by the Director of Human Resources.</P>

<dl>
<dd><strong><a href="links.html#3G">SPECIFIC AUTHORITY</a></strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>Florida Administrative Code 6C-5.950 (3)
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>To establish the procedure and responsibilities for processing the complaints of University Support Personnel System (USPS) and Administrative and Professional (A&amp;P) employees.
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>A.	PROCEDURES</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
	<dl>
	<dd>1.	Time limitations
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The time limitations (see Complaint Procedure Flowchart) established in this policy are imposed to ensure timely consideration and response by management to the complaint.  When circumstances necessitate, the parties may 	mutually agree to waive the time limitation with the approval of the Director or designee of Human Resources.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Failure of the University at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on the Complaint within the specified time limit shall permit the complainant to proceed to the next step.  Failure of the complainant to initiate action at any step of this procedure within the specified time limit shall be deemed a waiver of the complaint.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>In the event that any action falls due on a Saturday, Sunday, or State or Federal holiday, the action will be considered timely if it is accomplished by 5:00 p.m. on the following business day.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>In the event the resolution of the complaint results in an award to the complainant, the award shall not be retroactive to a date earlier than the date of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the complaint under consideration, and in 	no event more than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of the complaint.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>2.	Applicability 
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a.	Employees with permanent status in the USPS shall have access to the full Complaint Procedure.  Employees who have not achieved permanent status in the USPS may pursue this Complaint Procedure only through their immediate supervisor and the next level supervisor whose decision shall be final.  Employees who do not have permanent status shall not have the right to a review of their complaint by a Complaint Review Officer.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Employees who are on A&amp;P Regular and Multi-Year appointments shall have access to the full Complaint Procedure.  A&amp;P employees on other appointments may pursue this Complaint Procedure only through their immediate supervisor and the next level supervisor whose decision shall be final.  A&amp;P employees in other appointments shall not have the right to review their complaint by a Complaint Review Officer. 
		<dd>&nbsp;
		</dl>

	<dd>3.	Form
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The following form is used in this procedure and may be obtained from the Employee/Labor Relations Section of the Human Resources Department: FSU USPS and A&amp;P Complaint Procedure Form
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>4.	Initial Action (Step 1)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>When an employee feels that a complaint exists, the employee should arrange a meeting with the immediate 	supervisor.  This meeting must be held within thirty (30) calendar days from the date that the employee became aware of the act or condition that is the basis of the complaint.  The complaint may be expressed orally or in writing.  It is the intent of Florida State University that, whenever possible, complaints be resolved at this stage, through discussions between the employee and the immediate supervisor.  The immediate supervisor must respond to the employee's complaint within five (5) calendar days of the first meeting.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>5.	Filing A Written Complaint (Step 2)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Permanent employees who do not consider their complaint resolved after meeting with their immediate supervisor shall file their complaint in writing using an FSU USPS and A&amp;P Complaint Procedure Form. (Complaint Form - Part A)  The complaint will not be reviewed by supervisors above the level of the immediate supervisor unless the complaint is filed in written form.  The complaint at Step 2 should be filed with the employee's immediate supervisor within five (5) calendar days of receiving the reply to the initial action (Step 1) from the immediate supervisor.
	</dl>

<P><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> At the same time, the employee shall furnish a copy of the written complaint to the Director or designee of Human Resources who will determine if the complaint is one over which the University has control.  If it is determined that the subject matter of the complaint is beyond the control of the University, the employee shall be notified in writing.  Copies of the complaint and the decision that the grievance is beyond the control of the University will be sent to the appropriate vice-president.</em></P>

<P><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>If requested, a member of the Employee/Labor Relations staff of the Human Resources Department will assist both the employee and the supervisor in completing the written complaint form. The employee should be specific in the written complaint and clearly show what action is requested to resolve the complaint.</em></P>

	<dl>
	<dd>The employee should submit one (1) copy of the written complaint to the immediate supervisor, and retain one (1) copy.  Upon receiving the complaint from the employee, the immediate supervisor will provide a written response on the form and forward it to the next level of supervision. (Complaint Form - Part B) (This should be done expeditiously since there is a ten (10) day limitation on the response time at Step 2.)  If the second level supervisor deems it appropriate, the written complaint may be forwarded to the next higher level of supervision for review.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The second level supervisor should arrange for a meeting with the complainant to ensure a full and complete discussion of the problem with all levels of management deemed appropriate.  The second level supervisor is encouraged to consult with others as necessary in order to fully investigate the complaint where it is considered appropriate.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Efforts to resolve the complaint should be made up to and including review at the Dean, Director or Department Head level, if necessary. The written response from these levels of supervision shall be returned to the employee within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the written complaint. (Complaint Form - Part C)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>At the request of either the complainant, or the Dean, Director, Chairperson, or vice-president, a member of the Employee/Labor Relations staff will be present at the meeting to provide assistance as needed.  The Human Resources staff member will assist in any problem resolution and ensure that no violation of SUS or University Rules or Regulations occurs.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>6.	Request For Review by <a href="glossary.html#ComRevOff">Complaint Review Officer</a> (Step 3)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If the review by the second level supervisor, and the written response provided by the second level supervisor are unsatisfactory to the employee, the employee may request a further review by a Complaint Review Officer within five (5) calendar days of receiving the written response to the employee's written complaint (Step 2).  The employee should submit the request for review by a Complaint Review Officer, along with the complete file of the complaint, to the 	Director or designee of Human Resources, with a copy to the employee's immediate supervisor.  The employee should submit any pertinent information to be included in the complete complaint file for consideration by the review officer.  The Complaint Procedure does provide for the use of witnesses, and as such the written information provided should include the name, job title, and telephone number of individuals who have first-hand information concerning the complaint.  The employee should also indicate, in detail, the information that can be provided by the listed individuals. (Complaint Form - Part D)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If the employee desires to have a representative respond to the questions of the review officer, the name, title, and telephone number of the representative should also be included in the documentation submitted to the Director or designee of Human Resources.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>At the same time the employee requests a review by a Complaint Review Officer, the employee's department should immediately submit to the Director or designee of Human Resources, the names of those who participated in the departmental review.  The department should also include the name, title, and telephone number of the departmental representative who will provide additional information if requested by the Complaint Review Officer. (Complaint Form - Part E)
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>All of the written material submitted for the Complaint Review Officer review must be complete, concise, and specific to the point of clearly identifying  the problem and specifically stating the action or remedy that the employee desires.  Should the Director or designee of Human Resources feel that the written complaint is not sufficiently specific or that the requested information has not been provided, the Director or designee of Human Resources may request additional information from all parties to the complaint.  The Director or designee of Human Resources shall be responsible for assuring the employee's complaint is either resolved at Step 1 or 2, or to ensure a Complaint Review Officer is appointed to hear the complaint within ten (10) calendar days from the date the appointment of a Complaint Review Officer was requested.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>7.	Selection of Complaint Review Officer
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Upon receipt of the request for review by a Complaint Review Officer, the Director or designee of Human Resources shall appoint an individual from the University community, outside the division of the complaining employee, to act as the Complaint Review Officer.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>8.	Responsibilities of Complaint Review Officer
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The Complaint Review Officer may choose between conducting a complaint meeting; performing an investigation; or reviewing the written record, in order to establish facts, conclusions and recommendations. The Complaint Review Officer:
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a.	Assures the review is thorough and objective.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Assures the review is fair and completely impartial.

	</dl>

<dd><strong>A.	COMPLAINT PROCEDURES</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
	<dl>
	<dd>1.	Complaint Sources
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>A USPS or A&amp;P employee of the Florida State University who believes that he or she has been a victim of unlawful discrimination in violation of this policy may obtain a review of the grievance by filing a formal complaint detailing the time, the place and the specific facts in support of the alleged discriminatory act, utilizing procedures as described herein.  
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a.	The employee will contact the Employee/Labor Relations Section of the Human Resources office to formally file a complaint.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The USPS and A&amp;P Complaint Procedure is the official form used to formally file the unlawful discrimination complaint.  Reference USPS and A&amp;P Complaint Procedure.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Under s.760.10, Florida Statutes, a University employee who has a complaint that involves unlawful discrimination, may alternatively file a grievance with the Florida Commission on Human Relations.  Employees may also file complaints of unlawful discrimination externally with the Regional Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP), or utilize private counsel as desired.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>c.	The use of an external unlawful discrimination complaint/grievance source by an employee supersedes the jurisdiction of internal University unlawful discrimination grievance sources.

		</dl>

	<dd>2.	Confidentiality
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>All unlawful discrimination complaints and related records properly brought before established institutional complaint/grievance sources shall be exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Chapter 119, Florida Statutes.  Such complaints or records will be held in confidence until such time as a finding is made related to probable cause; the investigation of a complaint becomes inactive; or, the complaint or other record is made a part of the official record of any hearing of court procedure.  This will not affect the release of information to the Florida Commission on Human Relations or any state or federal agency which has authority to access such complaints of record under any provision of law.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	</dl>

<dd><strong>B.	OTHER EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCE SOURCES</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>Any employee who feels that he or she has an employment related grievance should first attempt to informally resolve the problem through oral discussion with his or her immediate supervisor and if necessary, with the next level of supervision.  Where informal resolution is not achieved, the employee may follow the grievance and appeal procedures prescribed by either the USPS and A&amp;P Complaint Procedure or by the appropriate employee union as identified below:

<dd>Florida Administrative Code Chapter 6C-5.955
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>To specify the methods and responsibilities for implementing a layoff of <a href="glossary.html#USPS">University Support Personnel System (USPS)</a> employees.
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>To present guidelines for complying with rules promulgated by the Board of Regents of the State University System.  In this respect, these guidelines may describe the operation of such rules by explanation or description of the provisions of rules.  Applicable rules are, where appropriate, specifically cited within the text of this procedure and are controlling.
<dd>&nbsp;
</dl>

<P><em><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Layoffs for A&amp;P employees will be handled in accordance with 6C-5.955(2)(g).</em></P>

<dl>
<dd><strong>A.	PROCEDURES - <a href="glossary.html#Layoff">LAYOFF</strong></a>
<dd>&nbsp;
	<dl>
	<dd>1.	The <a href="glossary.html#DesArea">designated area of layoff</a> is the University division in which the layoff will occur, within fifty(50) miles of the employee(s) to be laid off work location, and may also be referred to as a competitive area.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>2.	Notice of pending layoff
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>When a decision is reached to reduce the work force, the manager responsible for the budget that is to be affected by the abolition of a position will notify the Employee/Labor Relations Section of Human Resources by letter.  The letter will state that a layoff action is to be initiated and must include the following information:
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a.	Reason position is being abolished;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Name of the person filling the position to be abolished;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>c.	Class of position; 
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>d.	Legislative number of the position;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>e.	Number of the budget in which the position is funded;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>f.	Date the position is to be abolished.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>The Human Resources is to be notified of a pending layoff at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the date that the position is to be abolished.  A completed Classification Action Request form is to be attached to the notice.  The forty-five (45) day notice provides time to comply with notification to the union and also to assist the employee on layoff notice in finding alternative employment. 
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>If the employee does not find alternative employment or is not placed during this period of time, the employee shall be given an official notice of layoff at least fourteen (14) days prior to the layoff date, or two (2) weeks pay at the employee's current regular hourly rate, or a combination of notice and pay.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		</dl>

	<dd>3.	Layoff notice
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The university shall make reasonable effort to notify  AFSCME at least thirty (30) days in advance of a layoff.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>4.	Employment freeze
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Two (2) weeks prior to the actual date of layoff, a freeze throughout the competitive area is placed on filling vacant positions that are in the same class as the position to be abolished, or other classes in which the affected employee has held permanent status.  The Human Resources will inform the departments affected by the freeze.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>5.	<a href="glossary.html#Reassign">Reassignment</a> of displaced employees
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Employees affected by a layoff will be assigned to vacant positions whenever feasible.  Displacement of other employees may occur only when no vacancies exist that can be offered the affected employee.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>When an occupied position is to be abolished in a department or college, the employee with the least retention points in the class within the department or college, respectively, shall be the employee affected by layoff or subject to reassignment to a vacant position in another department within the competitive area.  Displaced employees shall next be assigned to vacant positions in the same university division (the designated area of layoff).  If vacant positions do not exist, the displaced employee shall be laid off.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>When a department generates a vacant position within one (1) year in the same class that was previously abolished, the employee who was previously reassigned from that department shall be returned to the vacant position at the option of the department to which the employee was reassigned.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>6.	Reassignment to a vacant position
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If a vacancy exists in the same department or college, respectively, in the same class as the abolished position, the displaced employee will be reassigned to that position.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If a vacancy does not exist in the same department or college, respectively, and a vacancy does exist in the same class in another department within the competitive area, the displaced employee will be reassigned to that position.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If more than one (1) vacancy in the same class exists in other departments or colleges, respectively, within the competitive area, the employee will interview for each position in an effort to determine the best match of the employee to a position.  If the displaced employee is not offered a position by one (1) of the prospective employers, the Director of Human Resources will reassign the employee to a vacant position within the competitive area.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>7.	Reassignment to a non-vacant position
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If there are no vacant positions in the same class of the abolished position that can be offered the displaced employee, the employee may displace another employee in the same class who has lower retention points.  If several employees in the same class have lower retention points, the employee with the lowest retention points will be displaced without disruption of those employees with intermediate retention points.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If the employee who is displaced, due to having the lowest retention points within a class as determined by the computations outlined in the Paragraph 12(b) of this procedure has permanent status at the same pay grade in another class, an attempt will be made to place the employee in a vacant position as outlined in Reassignment to a Vacant Position, above.  If no vacancy exists, the employee may displace another employee having lower retention points in 	the other class.  The employee with the lowest retention points will be displaced without disruption to those employees with intermediate retention points.  If an employee is ultimately displaced from a particular pay grade level, the employee may elect to accept a demotion to a lower pay grade as described below.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>8. 	<a href="glossary.html#Voluntary">Voluntary demotion</a> in lieu of layoff
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>A permanent employee who is displaced by a layoff action may elect, in writing, to be demoted in lieu of a layoff.  The employee must have held permanent status in a class within the <a href="glossary.html#Series">series</a> or a class in which the employee has previously held permanent status to be eligible for a demotion in lieu of layoff.  If the employee elects to be demoted, the employee will be reassigned to a vacant position.  If a vacant position is not available, the employee can displace another employee only if he/she has more retention points than the other employees within the series or a class in which the employee has previously held permanent status.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>With any reassignment or demotion, voluntary or involuntary, a reduction in pay may be required.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>9.	Layoff action
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The Human Resources will coordinate all activities required to reassign or displace employees where a layoff action is necessary.  An employee who is affected by a layoff action will be notified by the Human Resources of his/her options or reassignment.  Each employee will be requested to respond in writing if there are options the employee wishes to exercise.  Affected departments will be kept informed of layoff actions by the Human Resources.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Reassignment and displacement of employees will take place as directed by the Human Resources Employee/Labor Relations in coordination with the affected department on or before the date the position is abolished.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The department involved in the reassignment or demotion of an employee due to a layoff action will submit a Personnel Action Form to the Human Resources.  A department that is separating an employee from University employment due to a layoff will submit a Personnel Action Form and the Termination Checklist to the Human Resources Compensation to terminate the employee.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>An employee who has <a href="glossary.html#PermStatus">permanent status</a> and who is laid off shall be given at least fourteen (14) days notice of such layoff or in lieu thereof, two (2) weeks pay at the employee's current regular hourly rate, or a combination of notice and pay.  A written notice of layoff shall be hand delivered to the employee or be sent to the employee by certified mail, return receipt requested.  
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Within seven (7) calendar days after receiving the notice, the USPS employee shall have the right to request a change in assignment or, if not available or the employee's preference, a demotion in lieu of layoff to a position in a class in which the employee held permanent status, or to a position in a class in which the employee has not held permanent status if the employee has previously held permanent status in a higher or equal level class within the series.  Appointment to positions in lieu of layoff is conditioned on the employee meeting the specific qualifications for the position.  
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Any requested reassignment or a demotion by an employee being laid off shall be granted unless the results would be to cause the layoff of another employee who possesses a greater total of retention points.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>An employee who would be laid off as a result of another employee having a greater number of retention points shall have the same right of reassignment or demotion as provided in this procedure.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If an employee requests a reassignment or demotion in lieu of layoff, the same formula and criteria for establishing retention points for that class, and the same procedures for determining employees to be laid off, shall be used.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>An employee appointed to fill a position that has been designated as a USPS time-limited position shall not have any retention rights.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>10. Appeal rights
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The Human Resources will inform all employees who are affected by a layoff action of their right to review by an arbitrator.  Appeals concerning separation due to layoff action must be based on the grounds that the layoff action was not conducted in accordance with this Policy and Procedure.  Under no circumstances is a layoff to be considered a disciplinary action and must not be used in place of disciplinary action.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>11.	Status of laid off persons
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>The names of persons separated due to layoff action will be furnished by the Human Resources to other Universities within the SUS where like skills are employed.  The name of the employee shall remain on such register for a period of one (1) year, unless the employee requests, in writing, removal from the register.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>If a vacancy occurs, or a new position is established in the same class within the competitive area in which the employee was laid off, the effected employee with the highest number of retention points, shall for a period of one (1) year from the date of layoff, be offered re-employment.  Subsequent offers, shall, for a period of one (1) year following layoff, be made to the employees laid off in the order of their total retention points.  An employee who refuses such offer of re-employment shall forfeit any rights to subsequent placement offers.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>Persons who are separated due to layoff action and who have permanent status are not considered to have had a break in service if rehired to a USPS position within one (1) year from the date of separation.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>12.	Retention rights of USPS employees
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>a. Order of Layoff
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Layoff shall be made by class of positions, and within each class such layoff shall be made in the following order: emergency, temporary, trainee, provisional, probationary, and permanent employees.  No permanent employee shall be laid off while non-permanent employees are serving in the same class in the competitive area from which the layoffs are to be made, regardless of the source of funds for the position from which the employee is paid.  (Exception is time-limited positions) Employees who do not have permanent status may be laid off without applying the provisions for calculation of retention points.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>b.	Calculation of Retention Points
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>Within the competitive area, all employees who have permanent status in the affected class shall be ranked on a layoff list based on the total retention points derived from the combined total of length-of-service points and the performance evaluation points.  The layoff list shall be prepared with the name of the employee with the highest total retention points at the top of the list, and the employee with the lowest total retention points at the bottom of the list.  The layoff shall be in inverse order beginning at the bottom of the list.
		<dd>&nbsp;
			<dl>
			<dd>(1)	Length-of-service retention points shall be earned as follows:
			<dd>&nbsp;
				<dl>
				<dd>(a)	One (1) point for each month of continuous employment.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>(b)	Continuous employment for the purpose of this section shall be construed as employment within the University in a USPS classification if the employee was in pay status in a salaried (non-OPS) position; or, for those employees serving in positions in the State University System on June 30, 1986, which are converted to USPS positions, State employment in a Career Service and USPS classification if the employee was in pay status in a salaried (non-OPS) position.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				</dl>

			<dd>(2)	Performance evaluation retention points earned in the University for the class; or for those employees serving in positions in the State University System on June 30, 1986, which are converted to USPS position, performance evaluation retention points earned in a USPS classification, shall be based on:
			<dd>&nbsp;
				<dl>
				<dd>(a)  Two points for each month of service in which the employee was rated Outstanding or Above Satisfactory prior to January 1, 1985 and after that date rated as Exceeds Performance Standards, Superior Performance Standards or Above Performance Standards.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>(b)	One (1) point for each month of service in which the employee was rated Satisfactory prior to January 1, 1985 and after that date rated as Satisfactory, Achieves, or Meets Performance Standards.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>When an employee requests a demotion or reassignment, in lieu of layoff to a position in a class in the same series in which the employee has not held permanent 				status, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall apply.  Service shall be counted in the class in which the employee is currently serving, or in a higher class in 				the series in which the employee held permanent status.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>Special performance evaluations which have been prepared within three (3) months of the layoff shall not be used in calculation of retention points.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>If an employee has never been appraised in the class, all such service shall be credited as satisfactory, achieves or meets performance standards.  
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>Each period covered by a performance evaluation shall be the period reflected on the performance evaluation form.  Time spent in the class since the last performance evaluation shall be considered at the same performance level as the last performance evaluation.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>For the purpose of computing retention points, no performance evaluation points or length-of-service points shall be credited for the following situations:
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>(c)	For a month in which the employee was not on the payroll for at least fifty percent (50%) of the workdays of the month.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>(d)	For a month in which the employee was on an approved leave without pay for more than fifteen (15) calendar days.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>(e)	For a month in which the employee was holding a conditional unsatisfactory, or below performance standards performance evaluation for more than 				fifteen (15) calendar days in a month.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>Employees who work less than full-time shall have their retention points determined by computing their length-of-service points and performance evaluation points in proportion to the time worked.
				<dd>&nbsp;
				<dd>Should two (2) or more employees have the same combined total of retention points, the order of layoff shall be determined by giving preference for retention in the following sequence:
				<dd>&nbsp;
				</dl>

<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>Rule 6C-5.950(2), F.A.C.
<dd>&nbsp;

<dl>
<dd><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>The objective of the Alternative Discipline Program is to provide an alternative to the traditional progressive disciplinary process whereby an employee is suspended without pay for a violation of the University Disciplinary Standards.  Under the Alternative Discipline Program, an employee may be suspended <strong>with pay</strong> for one day in lieu of a suspension <strong>without pay</strong>.  The one-day suspension with pay should be accomplished by relieving the employee of his/her duties for a day set forth in the procedure below.
<dd>&nbsp;

<dd><strong>A.  PROCEDURES</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>1.  The employee receives written notice from management for a proposed suspension without pay for violation of the University Disciplinary Standards.
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>2.  The employee requests a predetermination conference with management to refute or explain the charges against him or her.
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>3.  The conference is conducted by the management representative authorized to make the final decision or his/her designated representative.
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>4.  The authorized management representative makes the decision to suspend the employee.
<dd>&nbsp;
	<dl>
	<dd>a.  Management may consider the Alternative Discipline Program to suspend the employee <strong>with pay</strong> for one day, as an alternative to a suspension <strong>without pay</strong>.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>b.  The employee will be given the opportunity to enter into a "Last Chance Agreement" with the parties agreeing to the following conditions:
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
		<dd>(1)  To accept the one day suspension with pay for the employee to evaluate whether he/she desires to continue working for the University and, if so, to correct the behavior or conduct;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>(2)  To waive his/her right to grieve or appeal the suspension with pay;
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>(3)  That any further occurrences of a similar nature could result in his/her dismissal; and
		<dd>&nbsp;
		<dd>(4)  If applicable, to any other conditions that may be pertinent to the specific disciplinary action.
		<dd>&nbsp;
		</dl>
	
	<dd>c.  If the employee does not agree to the above conditions, a final action letter will follow with a traditional suspension without pay.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>d.  If the employee agrees to all the conditions outlined above, a final action letter will outline the "Last Chance Agreement" and designate the one-day suspension <strong>with pay</strong>.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	<dd>e.  Management will determine a day on which to relieve the employee of duty and the employee's Pay and Leave Report will be documented in the Comments Section that the employee was on an "Alternative Discipline Day" pursuant to this policy.
	<dd>&nbsp;
	</dl>

<dd><strong>B.  SAVINGS</strong>
<dd>&nbsp;
<dd>The University will save substantial resources when alternative discipline is elected.  The University will avoid having to pay any arbitration costs under the USPS and A&P arbitration appeal process or other applicable grievance procedure.  Both the employee's and management's time may be expended productively in an attempt to work together to resolve any problems and avoid any further disciplinary action.

<P><a name="12"><strong>OP-C-7-G12 EMPLOYEE BACKGROUND CHECKS</strong></a></P>

<P><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
Applicants for employment with Florida State University may be subject to criminal history background checks.  Current employees of the University may be subject to criminal history background checks when University management has a justifiable reason pursuant to University procedures, policies and practices.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br>
To specify the methods and responsibilities in conducting criminal history background checks.</p>

<dl>
	<dd><strong>A.	PROCEDURES</strong>
	<dd>&nbsp;
		<dl>
			<dd>1.  Pre-employment criminal history background checks
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>Pre-employment criminal history background checks are to be conducted for business necessity reasons, such as access to property, proximity to students, fiduciary responsibilities, requirements pursuant to Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) regulations, or safety-sensitive functions.  The University should notify applicants of the required criminal history background check on the vacancy announcement for the position.   The requirement to submit to a background check shall be contained in the official position description.    
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>Examples of business necessity include, but are not limited to:
			<dd>&nbsp;
				<dl>
					<dd>a.	Access to cash and/or demand deposits;
					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>b.	Access to credit card numbers;
					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>c.	Ability to update/prepare/generate/enter a transaction that will result in one of the following: refund, wire transfer, automatic clearing house, vendor add/change or vendor address change;

					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>f.	Ability to process payroll, investments or security access transactions.
					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>g.	Access to property.
					<dd>&nbsp;
				</dl>
			
			<dd>All criminal history background checks should be coordinated through the University Police Department.  In accordance with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, if a criminal history background check reveals any felony or first degree misdemeanor convictions, the following factors should be considered to determine whether the convictions are grounds for denying employment:
			<dd>&nbsp;
				<dl>
					<dd>a.	The nature and gravity of the offense; and
					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>b.	The time period that has lapsed since the conviction; and
					<dd>&nbsp;
					<dd>c.	The nature of the job for which the applicant is applying.
					<dd>&nbsp;
				</dl>
				
			<dd>Pre-employment and random drug and alcohol testing is a requirement for positions that require a commercial driver's license (CDL) in accordance with Section OP-C-7-C9 of the Division of Finance and Administration, Human Resources, Policies and Procedures (Drug and Alcohol Testing Program).
			<dd>&nbsp;

			<dd>2.  Criminal history background checks for current employees
			<dd>&nbsp;
			<dd>A criminal history background check may be conducted on a current employee if University management has reason to believe an employee falsified his or her employment application, or for other justifiable reasons.  The Human Resources Department should be consulted prior to any criminal history checks of current employees.  All criminal history background checks should be coordinated through the University Police Department.  Should a criminal history background check reveal any felony or first degree misdemeanor convictions not previously divulged by an employee, contact the Employee/Labor Relations Section of Human Resources for further guidance.
