		<h4>Notable Individual Awards-$300</h4>
		
		
		This team designed, developed and implemented a comprehensive electronic personnel management system
		based on specific departmental needs.  The system includes electronic initiation of personnel actions, 
		approval process, and initiation of university personnel documents.  The system collects data that assists in 
		managing human resources, personnel budgets, and accomplishing periodic and unique reports regarding staffing/human 
		resources.<br><br>

		<h4>Notable Work Unit Awards-$600</h4>
		
		
		By combining the University's electronic requisition/purchase order system, Greets, with RightFax software,
		the University provided viewing of all procurement documents on one central Web site, including satellite
		areas.  This eliminated the necessity to transport and file thousands of purchase orders, receiving reports
		and other documents.<br><br>

		<strong>Online Active Appointment Report</strong>
		What were formally printed reports are now made available in
		an online format.  They are available sooner, do not have to be picked up/returned, save paper,
		are more flexible and easier to use.  The team leveraged the technologies and ideas used to create
		the 2000 Davis Productivity Award winner with a web based system that uses DB2 tables, 
		the REXX programming language and HTML. <br>

		integrating web technologies to the existing housing information system, has brought customer 
		and staff convenience, improved customer service, and cost savings to University Housing.<br>
		No Picture-Brian Buckner, Jason Lammert, Pete McNally, Sue Mahoney, Bill Hinchcliffe, Frank Cuevas<br><br>
		
		<strong>Tracking System for Parking Permits</strong>
		Created an inventory and tracking system for parking 
		permits, by writing new software.  Permits are now associated with a person, providing the
		ability to know the location and status at any time; automate renewals for faculty/staff; ease
		transfer between vehicles; insure correct issuance by type; and allow citation payment before 
		posting to accounts receivable.<br>
		No Picture-Angela Gaskins<br><br>
		
		
		<strong>Going Above and Beyond Work Responsibilities</strong> 
		Mr. Wirth's achievement is his ability and dedication to going above and beyond 
		the call of duty for his job and the university by learning all the different positions 
		in his office and making himself available to work in all of the different areas at any time.<br>

		<strong>Automated Parking Permit System</strong>- Expanded the annual renewal process to a 5-7-renewal cycle.
		The industry standard is to renew employee parking permits each year, but with advanced computer
		technology and removable metal taglets this process has eliminated the need to register the owner's
		vehicle and process a new parking permit each fall.<br>
