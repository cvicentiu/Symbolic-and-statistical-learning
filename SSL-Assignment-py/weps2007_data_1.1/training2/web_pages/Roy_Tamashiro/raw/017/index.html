<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Comments</strong></u>: Our beliefs underlie and drive what we do, and how we act and react. Our personal beliefs toward discipline and the roles of the teacher and student in the learning process, as well as our personal beliefs about delinquent and disruptive students, will determine the type and effectiveness of all learning strategies, be they behavioral, academic or vocational. Teachers provide instruction, establish classroom management plans, and develop interventions based on the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What teachers have the most training in</strong>: The philosophy, educational strategies (or lack of), and approaches to discipline that teachers are taught (beginning in pre-service programs and continuing through various in-services) drive the teacher-student learning environment. For example, teachers trained using direct instruction approaches will usually rely on this method of delivery. Teachers taught to emphasize content will do so, as opposed to implementing the teaching process. It is only when teachers <strong>believe </strong>that what they have been taught is no longer effective will they be responsive to change. Consequently, staff development must address teacher-accepted strategies until those strategies can be proven to be ineffective for the situation, subject, or student population. Therefore, <strong>first train teachers to be more effective in what they know</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What teachers believe</strong>: Teachers are people first. The belief system they bring to the &quot;education table&quot; is in large part pre-shaped by social-environmental factors that begin to develop at birth. Opinions of significant others (i.e. family, friends, and peers) influence a teacher's attitude regarding delinquent and disruptive students. This occurs before they decide to become teachers or come into contact with these &quot;disagreeable scholars.&quot; Consequently, stereotypes, prejudices, etc., can be developed. These stereotypes significantly impact the teachers’ willingness to assess their own contribution to classroom difficulties. When teachers’ existing strategies prove to be ineffective they will only consider those interventions that are consistent with their belief system. Therefore, when their current strategies are acknowledged by the individual teacher to be ineffective, <strong>provide strategies that are consistent with their belief system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What staff development facilitators provide the teachers</strong>: Teachers respond only when staff development facilitators provide information consistent with the teachers’ current training experiences. When training provided goes beyond or is in opposition to the teacher's current knowledge, conflict occurs. Training must be consistent with the teacher’s belief system. If the teacher's belief system interferes with staff development activities, the current beliefs must be addressed in a concrete and functional manner (the teachers acknowledge that their current beliefs are negatively impacting the learning environment). Thus, strategies that require modification in instructional approaches, including service delivery, management plans, etc., can be presented. Therefore, prior to presenting staff development strategies, address current teacher belief systems and reconcile their impact on learning. <strong>Only present strategies that can be implemented consistently with any modified beliefs. Until beliefs are modified there will be no instructional change in the classroom. It is critical to address teacher beliefs prior to implementing change.</strong></p>

<p>Roy Tamashiro (1981) identified three approaches teachers use with regard to classroom discipline/management:</p>

<OL>
<li><strong>Facilitative</strong>:<br>
<ul>
<li>Teacher is a resource.</li>
<li>Teacher provides facilitative learning environment.</li>
<li>Students express themselves freely and learn from reactions to these expressions.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Interventionist</strong>:<br>
<ul>
<li>Teacher is the adult.</li>
<li>Teacher is responsible for providing structure and content.</li>
<li>Teacher's purpose is to control the environment through the use of directive techniques.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Interactive</strong>:<br>
<ul>
<li>Teacher is the consultant.</li>
<li>Learning occurs best when there is an interaction between the student and teacher.</li>
<li>Teacher's function is to constantly interact with the student.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Which approach is best to use with disruptive and delinquent youth?</em> <strong>The approach the teacher believes is most effective!</strong> All three approaches are effective. Each requires a different set of instructional strategies, planning, and implementation. <strong>[Note: Be prepared to discuss with teachers the plusses and minuses of each approach].</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why students do what they do. [Note: exactly parallels teachers - (see above)]</strong> What students believe drives how they act and react. Their personal beliefs toward school and learning, the roles of self and the teacher in the learning process, and their personal beliefs about teachers will determine the impact of all learning strategies, be they behavioral, academic or vocational. Students receive instruction, respond to classroom management plans, and react to interventions based on the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What students have the most training in</strong>: The philosophy, educational strategies (or lack of), and approaches to discipline that students have been exposed to, drive the student's receptiveness to the learning environment. For example, students who have been reinforced to misbehave as a means of getting attention will rely on this method for getting attention. Students &quot;taught&quot; that course content is too difficult for them will not attempt the material. Students &quot;taught&quot; that they cannot learn will not learn. It is only when students <strong>believe </strong>that what they have been &quot;taught&quot; (e.g. that they cannot learn) is no longer effective, will they respond to change. Consequently, teachers must address student-accepted strategies until those strategies can be proven to be ineffective for the situation, subject, or the teacher. Therefore,<strong> students must first be trained to be more effective in what they know</strong>. This is a basic principle of positive reinforcement.</p>

<p><strong>What students believe</strong>: Students are people first. The belief system they bring to the &quot;education table&quot; has been, in large part, pre-shaped by social-environmental factors that began developing at birth. Opinions of significant others (family, friends and peers) influence students' attitudes regarding education, teachers and classroom performance. This happens before they enter the classroom or come into contact with their current teacher. Consequently, stereotypes, prejudices, etc., can be developed which significantly impact the students' willingness to assess their own contribution to the learning process. When students’ existing strategies prove to be ineffective they will only consider those interventions that are consistent with their belief system. Therefore, when their current strategies are acknowledged by the individual student to be ineffective, <strong>provide strategies that are consistent with their belief system until that system can be changed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What teachers provide the students</strong>: The student will respond only when teachers provide information that is consistent with the student's experiences. <strong>[Note: when teaching methodologies, expectations, etc., go beyond or in opposition to the student's current frame of reference, conflict occurs. However, to ultimately be effective, teaching must still be consistent with the student's belief system until the student's beliefs can be changed.]</strong> If the student’s belief system interferes with learning, it is only when those beliefs are addressed in a concrete and functional manner (i.e. the student acknowledges that their current beliefs are negatively impacting their learning) that new instructional strategies can be presented. Therefore, prior to presenting new teaching strategies, address current student belief systems and reconcile their impact on learning. <strong>Until beliefs are modified there will be no change in learning within the classroom. Only present strategies that can be implemented consistently with any modified beliefs. It is critical to address student beliefs prior to implementing change.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, there are three approaches to discipline/classroom management: facilitating, interacting, and intervening. The most effective single approach is the one the teacher believes is most effective. Perhaps the most effective approach is a combination of all three. This would be true for both academic and behavioral activities or interventions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: The use of the three-discipline management approaches in:</p>

<blockquote><strong>An Academic Segment:</strong>

<OL>
<li>Clarify assignment, present content/process - <strong>Interventionist</strong></li>
<li>Allow class to do assignment - individual/group - <strong>Facilitator</strong></li>
<li>Review assignment, give feedback, process - <strong>Interactionist</strong></li>
</OL></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Behavioral:</strong>

<OL>
<li>Behavior is a clear and present danger, disrupts entire class - <strong>Interventionist</strong></li>
<li>Teach student to accept responsibility – <strong>Interactionist</strong></li>
<li>Allow student to receive natural consequences for behavior - <strong>Facilitative</strong></li>
</OL></blockquote>
