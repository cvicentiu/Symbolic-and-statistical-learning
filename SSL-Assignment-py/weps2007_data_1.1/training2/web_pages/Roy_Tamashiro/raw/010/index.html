<h2>Ego Development Ongoing Events</h2>

At the present time, all I am aware of is my personal projects.  You may

<a href=ego_development/ego_dev_symposium.html>Ego Development
Symposium</a> (initial announcement)<p>

The initial announcement of the Ego Development Symposium remains in place
as a historical reminder and a prompt to encourage feedback on the various
topics that were discussed and ongoing developments.  Soon we hope to have
in place a listserv and web site formally.  A couple of offers have been
made, but nothing has been finalized.  In the meantime, to get things
going, I will put my thoughts here on my site (which I still have courtesy
of my involvement with you folks!) and encourage some feedback here.
Until we get something else going, I will simply copy email to me into a
single document so others can see and respond to it.  the group is
currently small and I do not anticipate an excessive demand, though I
would not complain if there was.<p>

The luncheon especially was a great time for me, renewing old friendships
and beginning new ones.  Some of you are already way ahead of me--Roy
Tamashiro, for one.  I know you'll enjoy visiting his web site, a wealth
of resources in many relevant issues. <a

It is also always a great joy to be with L&ecirc
Xu&acirc;n Hy again.  Here
