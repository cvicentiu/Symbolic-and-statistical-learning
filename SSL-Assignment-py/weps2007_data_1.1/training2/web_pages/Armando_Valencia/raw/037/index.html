			 </TABLE><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Hello and Welcome to
			 the April Newsletter! I hope this day you have allowed the Spirit of God to be
			 active within your heart, and that you are able to perhaps get out for a hike
			 and consider many of the wonders He has made. Watching and contemplating the
			 sunrise is a good way to start. <BR><BR>WEBSITE NEWS: Be sure to visit the New
			 Birth Trail this month... The construction of its <I>Mountain of Believing</I>
			 trail junction has just been completed. This hike will be quite illuminating in
			 your endeavors to learn more about God and to trust in His promises... More
			 construction on the <I>Trail of Time</I> will be completed during the next few
			 months. New construction continues also on the <I>Mountain and Valley
			 Trail</I>. <BR>The number of visitors to the website is beginning to increase.
			 I have received some very encouraging responses from viewers of the site. I am
			 always excited to answer these responses and I hope each of you will continue
			 to spread word of the site to your friends and family. You can also help the
			 site to reach many others when you receive a "forward" from anyone on any
			 topic... Just use all of the enclosed addresses and send them our address...
			 www.hikingthetrailoftruth.com. Please include a note to "check out this
			 informative website." Thank you for your help!<BR><BR> OTHER NEWS: I hope to
			 get to June Lake, California in May. My good friends, Ed Ostashay and Armando
			 Valencia, are planning a camping, hiking and fishing outing for the 14th
			 through the 19th. It's been a long time since I have had the honor to spend
			 some time with Ed, Armando and other friends from the old "days of high
			 adventure" (see Newsletter Archives, for January, the <I>Friends Along the
			 Trail</I> segment). Should the Lord allow me to make this trip to June Lake and
			 to see those friends, it will be indeed a humbling yet glorious reunion. My
			 movie camera is ready to go too! There are however much more important things
			 to pray for nowadays, but I sure need to see these friends again and to share
			 their company for awhile. Visiting "friends of the heart" can be extremely
			 encouraging, something like finding a green plant in the middle of a parched
			 desert. <BR><BR>NEXT MONTH'S <I>Letter from the Editor:</I> Our attitude
			 regarding world events, ie: War in Iraq. How should we think? What should we
			 feel and what should we do? <BR><BR>THIS MONTH: <I>Walking by faith and not by
			 sight:</I> When I was a young married man, my wife and I journeyed from Ohio to
			 California where I eventually became a peace officer. We bought a home in 1970,
			 in a town called Temple City. It was a small home but a good start for our
			 family of two boys. Along the driveway border there were several rose bushes in
			 a line. The Lord had given me the talent as well as the privilege to care for
			 these and other yard plants and trees in that little place. I remember taking a
			 lot of pride in those roses, and spent many warm mornings cultivating, watering
			 and smelling the results of a variety of beautiful rose blooms. I use to touch
			 the fuzzy ones and pick some now and then for a centerpiece on the kitchen
			 table that my wife had created.<BR><BR> As I look back I know that, though I
			 literally smelled those roses often, I never smelled them spiritually. You know
			 the old saying; stop and smell the roses? The "stop" means to do just that. It
			 means to stop and focus your attention on what you have been given in life and
			 learn to enjoy it. It takes a knowledge of God to do that. It takes more than
			 that; It takes actually<I> knowing</I> Him. I didn't know Him then as I do now.
			 As a result, I really didn't smell the roses. They still bloom to this day
			 along the Temple City property, though I have been long gone from that garden.
			 Those roses died in my heart through the years. They had no depth of soil, no
			 cultivation and no water. How I miss those roses! How I wish continuously that
			 back then I could have smelled them within my spirit. <BR><BR>That was indeed a
			 long time ago. Now I am in the autumn of my years. My losses through life have
			 been grievous. A day does not go by that I don't yearn to be back there,
			 cultivating that little garden and proceeding ahead in life with the knowledge
			 I <I>now</I> have. Through God's grace however, I have another garden. It's not
			 the same garden, but it is equally as beautiful. I do not own this garden but I
			 do rent the property it's on. It will never be that first garden nor can it
			 take its place. Yet, it is a garden cultivated through faith in God, something
			 the first garden, sadly, was not. <BR><BR>Faith is all that we have to live on
			 when we finally come to the realization that we cannot change things. Most of
			 us would like to undo or redo some years. We want to go back and smell each
			 rose that we overlooked, but most of us cannot. When we come to this point in
			 our knowledge we learn to see the true value of a believing faith. It becomes,
			 through an intense learning process, the only thing that will sustain us. It is
			 the only thing that will enlarge our hope for the future. Faith is of course
			 difficult because the substance of true faith cannot be clearly seen within the
			 world in which we live. It is in reality an invisible force which hopes in
			 invisible things. But once it takes firm root in what can't be seen, nothing is
			 impossible... <BR><BR>The naked eye will never see<I> how </I>faith operates.
			 So don't trust in what you can actually see. Remember Peter? He was a close
			 follower of Jesus. In Matthew 14, 22 thru 33, Peter and the rest of the
			 disciples were in a boat, crossing the sea of Galilee. They had sometime
			 earlier left Jesus on the eastern shore and were crossing to the other side,
			 per His instructions, by themselves, when threatening weather moved in upon
			 them. The story is as follows; <BR><BR><I>After He had dismissed them, he went
			 up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came He was there alone, but
			 the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by waves
			 because the wind was against it. During the fourth watch of the night Jesus
			 went out to them, walking on the water. When the disciples saw Him walking on
			 the water, they were terrified. "It's a ghost", they said and cried out in
			 fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be
			 afraid." <BR><BR>"Lord, if it is you", Peter replied, "tell me to come to you
			 on the water." <BR><BR>"Come," He said. <BR><BR>Then Peter got out of the boat,
			 walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But, when he saw the wind, he was
			 afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!" <BR><BR>Immediately
			 Jesus reached out His hand and caught him. "You of little faith", he said. "Why
			 do you doubt?" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then
			 those who were in the boat worshipped Him saying, "Truly you are the Son of
			 God."</I> <BR><BR>Did you notice that Peter indeed walked on water? I say it
			 again Peter, a person just like you or me, literally<I> walked</I> on the
			 water! Picture this reality in your mind as you contemplate it... Peter
			 <I>walked</I> on the water. But when he saw... when he <I>saw</I>, when he
			 <I>saw</I>... When he <I>saw</I> the wind he began to sink. He <I>began</I> to
			 sink. He <I>began </I>to sink. <BR><BR>Peter looked at the howling wind all
			 around him. With this threatening force in his sight he became afraid. Because
			 of what he <I>saw</I> he then experienced doubt and <I>began</I> to sink. If
			 you and I were to attempt to walk on water we would not <I>begin</I> to sink,
			 we would just "ploop" under the water immediately. Peter did not just "ploop."
			 He did not immediately or instantly sink as we would, but note that he
			 <I>began</I> to sink. He <I>began</I> to sink because <I>he saw</I>, he feared,
			 he obviously doubted and, losing his grip on faith, he <I>began</I> to sink.
			 <I>Immediately</I> then (before he lost all of his faith and just "plooped"
			 completely under water) Jesus reached out His hand and caught him. <BR><BR>What
			 we've learned here, what we've been shown by this example is that faith cannot
			 operate by sight. Sight always produces fear and doubt and ultimately, failure;
			 If we believe, for example, that God can cure an illness, but begin to look
			 physically at our condition, we by nature lose our faith in God's ability to
			 take away that illness. We sink because we saw. If we have faith that we can
			 move a mountain, but we <I>look</I> upon its size and weight, we then become
			 unable to move it. Again, our<I> natural </I>sight has slain us. <BR><BR>Jesus
			 promises us many things through our faith i<I>n Him</I>. Things that, if we
			 truly look at them, we know that we cannot physically attain or conquer or move
			 them. In order for our faith to be effective, in order to move the mountains in
			 our life, we cannot then look at them through our own eyes. We must look at
			 them through Jesus' eyes. We must look at them through <I>belief</I> in
			 <I>HIs</I> ability to help us move our mountains. We must <I>trust</I> in His
			 ability to help us remove our mountains. We must <I>depend</I> on His ability
			 to help us move or remove our mountains. Not just temporarily, but we must look
			 to Him always, every moment, continuously, in all things. This is the essence
			 of walking by faith and not by sight.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"

			 </TABLE><BR><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We began this new series
			 in June of 2002 and, thanks to positive subscriber responses, we've been able
			 to continue it, thank the Lord, in subsequent issues. Within this particular
			 series I have been reflecting on how certain friends, relatives and strangers
			 have influenced me over the years of my own life and times. As Christians we
			 are instructed to encourage one another daily. Lord knows that I have been
			 encouraged many times over the years through the words, actions, and
			 associations of others. It is indeed then time to honor them. I have honored
			 some of them before, yet, honoring others is something we really can't overdo
			 for those truly deserving of it. I sincerely hope that my reflections on these
			 "special characters" of my lifetime will cause you yourself to consider the God
			 given blessings that special characters have had on your <I>own</I> life.
			 <BR><BR>I would like this month to honor Ken George of southern California. I
			 graduated high school with Ken and we have been fortunate to have kept in touch
			 over the years. Ken usually calls me once a month to say hello and to offer his
			 encouragement. Thanks, Ken, for always putting your thoughts and concerns into
			 action. Lord knows how rare and extremely meaningful encouragement is. Your
			 kind efforts have always been appreciated. <BR><BR>Recently I have received
			 E-mail from Patty Palitto, Noreen Marton, and Cheryl Marton, former high school
			 classmates. Thanks to Patty's efforts to spread the news of this website, I
			 have received some very encouraging responses from these old and dear friends.
			 Thank you, Patty, for your endeavors to get Hiking the Trail of Truth out to
			 the world. There is great and unimaginable healing available through the things
			 God has made. Our present world needs desperately to see God in His creation
			 and to come to understand, through that experience, their personal need for
			 Him. This series is designed to help people discover the profoundness of that
			 truth. I truly and deeply appreciate the help of these former classmates for
			 their continued endeavors. <BR><BR>We're riding through St. Germain, Wisconsin
			 territory, where our trail leads to Chuck Chapman, retired California Peace
			 Officer and a man of the great outdoors. Chuck and I shared many adventures in
			 the Mojave Desert and along the streams and lakes of the High Sierra. Chuck is
			 truly one of a kind (actually, we all are) and knows more about fishing the
			 high country than anyone I know. He could probably live the rest of his life on
			 a float tube, providing he would not run out of backpack stove fuel to cook his
			 catch. Watching Chuck float out there under the deep blue Sierra sky,
			 surrounded by a backdrop of craggy mountain peaks, is indeed an honor. I can
			 never picture Chuck without a smile on his face or humor in his heart. Being
			 around him has always been a joy. Thanks, Chuck, for who God has made you to
			 be. I hope we can someday share a campfire once again! <BR><BR>We're passin'
			 through Ft. Collins, Colorado now, where Dr. Mike Mucci and his family reside.
			 Mike worked with me as a reserve police officer in southern California. He now
			 resides in this beautiful Colorado country where he has his dental practice and
			 spends his free time in the great outdoors with his son and daughter. Mike
			 appreciates the beauty and peace of spending time amidst many of God's wonders.
			 This is indeed a fortunate discovery for anyone, the key to a most vital
			 understanding. In times past, Mike and I twice shared the glory of ascending
			 Mt. Whitney in Lone Pine, California, highest peak in the contiguous United
			 States. The most important part of this adventure can be found on day hike # 7
			 of the <I>High Sierra Trail</I> at this (HTTOT) website. Thank you, Mike, for
			 your most cherished friendship and your continued integrity in life on this
			 earth. I hope to ascend Whitney once again this coming August, and you will be
			 in my heart with each step I take on that journey. <BR><BR>Thank you, Lord, for
			 these renowned friends. Please protect them and continue to bless them in this
			 life. Next month we'll ride once again with some <I>Friends Along the
			 Trail</I>. Any subscribers or viewers who wish to speak about and to honor
			 their friends, you're welcome to write in to Hiking the Trail of Truth, PO Box

			 can be located in Newsletter Archives <BR><BR>It didn't take long to find a few
			 necessities at the Big Pine general store. Hannah got some candy and bought a
			 little hand mirror for Riley. She bought a unique handwritten book on mountain
			 survival and a leather bracelet made by the local Indians. Ed and Ron picked up
			 a few items as well and the trio got started back toward the ranch before noon.
			 Once they arrived they passed on the news from Big Pine to Jeremiah and
			 Windwalker. They all went out and sat on the porch for lunch and talked about
			 it... <BR><BR>"There's no need to change our plans", Jeremiah encouraged. "I've
			 learned not to worry in life. You just step out each day and greet the sun and
			 deal with things as they come." <BR><BR>"You sound just like my dad", Hannah
			 said. "He said you've learned most everything there is to know."
			 <BR><BR>Jeremiah laughed. "I wish that were true, Hannah. Fact is, I don't know
			 much at all. I just have learned to trust in God, that he'll provide what I
			 need when I need it. Each day has it's trouble. You just have to be patient
			 enough to work through it. You've got to learn to enjoy the good moments and
			 learn to enjoy the challenges of the bad moments and give thanks for both. It's
			 a matter of balance. The animals know quite well how to do it. They've taught
			 me much over the years. God put understanding in them just like he did us. To
			 them, it's natural because they know who made them. For us, we have trouble
			 understanding because we allow other things to distract us. We forget who made
			 us and allow our emotions to rule us. We don't listen well to the wind. God
			 speaks to us everyday through the things he has made. We don't hear him unless
			 we're determined to know he's there." <BR><BR>"You're grandpa is a wise man",
			 Ron inserted. <BR><BR>"I know", Hannah replied. "I hope I can be like him."
			 <BR><BR>"I don't think you should hope in that, my dear," Jermiah replied with
			 a laugh. "You just be who <I>you</I> are. God gives us each a purpose. We're as
			 individual as those rocks on that mountain yonder", he gestured with a nod
			 toward the boulder strewn, high Sierra peaks. "Now, don't you forget that."
			 <BR><BR>The next morning was indeed a busy one at the Johnson ranch. David and
			 Sheri Perez had brought their sons and nephews to the ranch where they assisted
			 in packing gear and in making ready for the four boy's journey. The couple also
			 cooked a breakfast for the whole crew and also insisted on cleaning up in the
			 cabin and the kitchen. <BR><BR>"Don't you worry, Jeremiah", Sheri Perez
			 encouraged. "This cabin will stay nice and clean and cozy 'till you all get
			 back. I made some jerky and some cookies and they're in Sean's saddle bags,
			 along with a couple medicine dressings in case someone gets hurt. Those
			 dressings are laced with feather moss and mustard root... Mind you keep a
			 little water on them now and then to keep them damp." <BR><BR>"I'll do that",
			 Johnson assured her. <BR><BR>About an hour or so after sunrise the group was
			 well fed, saddled, loaded and ready. The weather above looked good. There were
			 no clouds on the peaks and warm air continued to prevail. Some snow was
			 actually melting in the high country which was somewhat unusual for December.
			 Sean and Taylor Perez soon hugged their mom and said good bye to their father,
			 who wished them God speed. The nephews too got in their hugs and all the boys
			 mounted up. Johnson told the Perez folks not to worry, that they would only be
			 gone about two weeks, and promised to bring them back an elk for their winter
			 food supply. <BR><BR>"I got a few hogs", David Perez told Jeremiah. "We should
			 be all right... no need to worry." <BR><BR>Jeremiah patted him on the back. "I
			 can't see a man feedin' on hog when he can feed on elk", he said as he climbed
			 into the saddle. "An old friend once told me that", he smiled... "I'll be sure
			 to find you a big one... You take care now", he nodded, then joined the others
			 who were anticipating that he would take the lead. <BR><BR>As the group started
			 down the road toward the High Sierra Trail, Hannah, Riley, Railroad Ron and
			 Jeremiah rode abreast up front. John Windwalker, Taylor Perez, Bryce and Cael
			 Rowland rode just behind them, while Ed Ostashay and Sean Perez took up the
			 rear, each of the latter pulling a pack mule behind him. The morning was
			 exquisite. The sunrise was now casting an orange glow on the eastern face of
			 the Sierra. The air was full of the unmistakable scent of sage. A single hawk
			 circled high above them which Windwalker pointed out to be a very good sign.
			 <BR><BR>"The hawk will guard us on our journey", he said. The boys riding
			 abreast him perked up their ears and listened intently. "He will warn us if
			 there is trouble, and he will alert us if there is any change in the weather.
			 My grandfather taught me these things when I was very young. The creatures of
			 the earth speak to us in many ways. I have learned to depend on their wisdom."
