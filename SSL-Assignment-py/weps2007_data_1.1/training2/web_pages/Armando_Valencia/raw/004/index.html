      <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fayette 
        County Sheriff's Department's Drug Task Force was lauded Thursday for 
        its participation in a federal drug sting that targeted a Mexican organization 
        distributing drugs in the metro Atlanta area. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week, 
        Fayette drug agents helped arrest 24 suspects and seize $3.1 million in 
        cash as over 200 law enforcement officers executed search warrants on 
        19 locations in metro Atlanta last week, said U.S. Attorney William S. 
        Duffey Jr. Authorities confiscated 254 kilograms of cocaine, 500 pounds 
        of marijuana, two pounds of methamphetamine and a half-pound of &quot;ice,&quot; 
        which is liquid methamphetamine. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fayette 
        drug agents played a crucial role in the sting, particularly with surveillance 
        operations, said W. Michael Furgason, Sr., special agent in charge of 
        the Drug Enforcement Administration. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They're 
        a great narcotics team and they bring a lot of experience we rely on,&quot; 
        Furgason said. &quot;It's just that they're good cops.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fayette County 
        Sheriff Randall Johnson said the bust was one of the biggest the department 
        has ever participated in. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's 
        the opportunity of a lifetime to be in on a drug bust this size,&quot; 
        Johnson said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 24 suspects 
        have all been charged in federal court with conspiring to distribute and 
        sell drugs in the area, Duffey said. Most of those arrested were immigrants 
        living illegally in the country, Furgason added. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bust was 
        announced at a news conference in Atlanta Thursday morning. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although none 
        of the drug activity took place in Fayette County, Sheriff Johnson said 
        it is important to help cut drug trafficking in the area before they are 
        distributed here. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We want 
        them (criminals) to know they'd better not come in here with it,&quot; 
        Johnson said. &quot;They know where the county line is now.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fayette 
        County Drug Task Force is comprised of agents from the Fayette County 
        Sheriff's Department, the Tyrone Police Department and the Pike County 
        Sheriff's Department. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duffey said 
        the Armando Valencia organization would import the drugs from Mexico and 
        stash them in large vehicles such as tractor trailers for transport into 
        cities like Atlanta. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the 18-month 
        investigation continued, it became more apparent that the Valencia organization 
        was very dangerous, Duffey said. When the search warrants were served 
        by officers early one morning, one suspect was found sleeping next to 
        a gun, Duffey said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone who 
        sleeps with a weapon within arm's reach &quot;is prepared to use it when 
        it has to be used,&quot; Duffey noted. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These 
        are professional dealers,&quot; Furgason said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although no 
        connections could be made to the Valencia organization, federal drug agents 
        have learned that many unsolved homicides are tied to drug trafficking 
        in general. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Authorities 
        decided to target the Valencia organization because &quot;it was the one 
        we knew the least about,&quot; Duffey said. The investigation revealed 
        the gang was very sophisticated in its operations, particularly in the 
        amount of time they spent trying to learn about law enforcement techniques. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of 
        the Valencia organization would spend as much time doing that counterintelligence 
        as they would actually selling the drugs, Duffey noted. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of 
        the operation was to &quot;dismantle&quot; the Valencia organization, 
        Duffey said. The head of the organization, Armando Valencia himself, was 
        arrested in Mexico with cooperation from authorities there, Duffey said. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The drugs would 
        travel from Reynosa, Mexico to McAllen, Tex., to Atlanta and beyond to 
        Knoxville, Tenn., Furgason said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Officers found 
        drugs in four metro Atlanta locations, at residences in Lilburn, Smyrna, 
        Norcross and Roswell, authorities said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Duffey 
        refused to go into details about what agents learned about the Valencia 
        organization or how the investigation was conducted, he said agents used 
        just about every investigative tactic in the book. </font>
