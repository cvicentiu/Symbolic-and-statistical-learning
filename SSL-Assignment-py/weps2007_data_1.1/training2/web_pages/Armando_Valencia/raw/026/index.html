            <P ><B>Mr. Donnie R. Marshall<BR>Acting 
            Administrator<BR>Drug Enforcement Administration<BR><BR></P>
            <DIV></DIV></B>
            <P>Chairman Grassley, Members of the Senate. I appreciate this 
            opportunity to appear before the Committee today to discuss the 
            issue of Certification and U.S. Counter narcotics efforts. I would 
            like first to thank the Committee for its continued support of the 
            Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and overall support of drug 
            law enforcement. </P>
            <P>As all of you are aware, DEA is first and foremost a law 
            enforcement agency. Although the certification process has proved to 
            be an effective diplomatic tool relative to the international 
            antidrug effort, as a matter of policy, DEA does not make 
            recommendations relative to certification. Each year, DEA provides 
            the Attorney General with an objective assessment of the drug 
            trafficking situation for a country based upon evidence and factual 
            information. DEA&rsquo;s analysis of counter-narcotics efforts by 
            another country does not include an opinion on whether a country 
            should or should not be certified. We merely present the facts to 
            U.S. policy makers and allow them to make an informed decision on 
            the certification of a respective country. As such, my comments 
            today will be limited to an objective assessment of the law 
            enforcement issues involved with drug trafficking. </P>
            <P>As part of the submitted written testimony, I have also included 
            the drug trafficking assessment reports of several countries which 
            were recently evaluated and either decertified or granted a waiver 
            due to vital U.S. interests. These countries include Afghanistan, 
            Burma, Cambodia, Paraguay, Nigeria and Haiti. Due, however, to the 
            magnitude of the threat drug traffickers pose to the national 
            security of both countries, along with the strategic importance to 
            the United States, I will direct much of today&rsquo;s testimony on 
            Mexico. </P>
            <P>As many of you know, criminal organizations based in Mexico pose 
            the greatest challenge to U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with 
            enforcing narcotics laws. Due to the ever-increasing legitimate 
            cross-border traffic and commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, 
            several international organized crime groups have established 
            elaborate smuggling infrastructures on both sides of the U.S./Mexico 
            border. Furthermore, it has long been established that in addition 
            to drug trafficking, these international criminal organizations 
            spawn violence, corruption, and intimidation that threaten the 
            safety and stability of our cities and towns across America. </P>
            <P>The complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking 
            groups operating out of Mexico are oftentimes vicious, destructive 
            entities, that operate on a global scale. The largest drug 
            trafficking organizations in Mexico --- operating out of 
            Guadalajara, Juarez, Mexicali, Tijuana, Sonora, and the Gulf region 
            --- under the auspices of Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes, Armando 
            Valencia-Cornelio, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Ramon and Benjamin 
            Arellano-Felix, and Osiel Cardenas-Guillen are in many ways, the 
            modern versions of the mob leaders and groups that U.S. law 
            enforcement has fought against since the beginning of last century. 
            These international organized crime leaders, however, are far more 
            dangerous, far more influential and have a greater impact on our 
            day-to-day lives than did their domestic predecessors. </P>
            <P>Those international traffickers and their organizations make 
            operational decisions from places like Sonora, Mexico and other 
            locations outside U.S. borders, which detrimentally affect the 
            quality of life of our citizens and directly support drug-related 
            crime in cities and towns across our country. These groups have 
            reached new levels of sophistication and have become a threat not 
            only to the United States and Europe, but also to their own 
            countries. Their power and influence are unprecedented. Unless 
            innovative, flexible, multi-faceted responses are crafted, these 
            drug trafficking organizations threaten to grow even more powerful 
            in the years to come. </P>
            <P><B>The Damage to the United States:</B></P>
            <P>In order to understand the extent and nature of the damage caused 
            by international drug trafficking organizations, it is crucial to 
            look at how these organizations work, and how they infiltrate and 
            position themselves in U.S. communities in order to further their 
            goals. </P>
            <P>On any given day in the United States, business transactions are 
            being arranged between the major drug lords headquartered in Mexico 
            and their surrogates who have established roots within the United 
            States, for the shipment, storage and distribution of tons of 
            illicit drugs. In the past, Mexico-based criminal organizations 
            limited their activities to the cultivation of marijuana and opium 
            poppies for subsequent production of marijuana and heroin. The 
            organizations were also relied upon by Colombian drug lords to 
            transport loads of cocaine into the United States, and to pass on 
            this cocaine to other organizations who distributed the product 
            throughout the U.S. However, over the past several years, 
            Mexico-based organized crime syndicates have gained increasing 
            control over many of the aspects of the cocaine, methamphetamine, 
            heroin and marijuana trades, resulting in increased threats to the 
            well-being of American citizens as well as government institutions 
            and the citizens of their own country. </P>
            <P>In the recent past, traffickers from Mexico had maintained 
            dominance in the western part of the United States, and in some 
            Midwest cities. Today, the Drug Enforcement Administration, along 
            with other law enforcement agencies, has developed evidence leading 
            to indictments demonstrating that associates of organized crime 
            groups based in Mexico have established themselves on the East Coast 
            of the United States, thus becoming significant participants in the 
            nationwide drug trade. </P>
            <P><B>Mexican Traffickers Rise to Prominence:</B></P>
            <P>During 1995 and 1996, intense law enforcement pressure was 
            focused on the Cali leadership by the brave men and women of the 
            Colombian National Police. As a result, all of the top trafficking 
            leaders from Cali were either jailed or killed. During that time 
            frame, U.S. law enforcement agencies were effectively attacking 
            Colombian cells operating within the United States. With the Cali 
            leaders imprisoned in Colombia and the successful attacks by law 
            enforcement on their U.S. cells, traffickers from Mexico took on 
            greater prominence. A growing alliance between the Colombian 
            traffickers and the organizations from Mexico worked to benefit both 
            sides. Traffickers from Mexico had long been involved in smuggling 
            marijuana, heroin, and cocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border, using 
            established distribution routes to deliver drugs throughout the 
            United States. The Mexico-based organizations&rsquo; emergence as 
            major methamphetamine producers and traffickers also contributed to 
            making them a major force in international drug trafficking. The 
            Mexican traffickers, who were previously paid in cash by the 
            Colombian traffickers for their services, began to routinely receive 
            up to one-half of a shipment of cocaine as their payment. This led 
            to Mexican traffickers having access to multi-ton quantities of 
            cocaine and allowed them to expand their markets and influence in 
            the United States, thereby making them formidable cocaine 
            traffickers in their own right. </P>
            <P>With the disruption of the Cali syndicate, Mexican groups such as 
            the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, the Arellano-Felix cartel, 
            the Amezcua-Contreras brothers, and the Caro-Quintero group, 
            consolidated their power and began to dominate drug trafficking 
            along the U.S.-Mexico border and in many U.S. cities. Recent events 
            in Mexico and along the southwest border emphasize the fact that 
            trafficking groups from Mexico have developed into a significant 
            force in international organized crime. </P>
            <P><B>Overview of Narcotics Smuggled along the U.S./Mexican 
            Border:</B></P>
            <P>Recent estimates indicate that approximately 55% of the cocaine 
            available in the United States is transported across the U.S.-Mexico 
            border. Typically, large cocaine shipments are transported from 
            Colombia, via commercial shipping, fishing and &ldquo;Go-fast&rdquo; 
            boats and off-loaded in Mexico. The cocaine is transported through 
            Mexico, usually by trucks, where it is warehoused in cities like 
            Guadalajara, Tijuana or Juarez, that are operating bases for the 
            major criminal trafficking organizations. The extremely high volume 
            of vehicular traffic over the U.S./Mexico border allows cocaine 
            loads to be driven across the border and taken to major distribution 
            centers within the U.S., such as Los Angeles, New Jersey, Chicago or 
            Phoenix. Surrogates of the major drug lords wait for instructions, 
            often provided over sophisticated communications devices-- --phones, 
            faxes, pagers or computers---telling them where to warehouse smaller 
            loads, who to contact for transportation services, and to whom to 
            return the eventual profits. Individuals sent to the United States 
            from Mexico, often illegally, have been shown to have contracted 
            with U.S. trucking establishments to move loads across the country. 
            Once the loads arrive in an area that is close to the eventual 
            terminal point, safehouses are established for workers who watch 
            over the cocaine supplies and arrange for it to be distributed by 
            wholesale dealers within the vicinity. These distributors have 
            traditionally been Colombian nationals or individuals from the 
            Dominican Republic, but recently, DEA has come upon evidence that 
            Mexican trafficking organizations are also directly involved in 
            cocaine distribution in New York City. </P>
            <P>We have not only identified the drug lords themselves, but in 
            most cases, the key members of their command and control structure. 
            The combined efforts of the DEA, FBI, DOJ, the U.S. Customs Service 
            and members of state and local police departments have resulted in 
            the seizure of hundreds of tons of drugs, hundreds of millions of 
            dollars in drug proceeds and most importantly, several significant 
            indictments. In fact, some of the leaders of these 
            organizations---Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, Luis and Jesus 
            Amezcua-Contreras, Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes----have become familiar 
            names in every major law enforcement department in the United 
            States. Despite this evidence, along with the notoriety, these 
            traffickers have continued to evade arrest and prosecution. </P>
            <P>The primary reason they have been able to avoid arrest and 
            continue their criminal enterprise is their ability to intimidate 
            witnesses and assassinate and corrupt public officials. Clear 
            examples of this point may be cited in recent efforts to apprehend 
            members of the Arellano Felix cartel and the Cardenas Guillen 
            cartel, based in Tijuana and Matamoros, Mexico, respectively. In 
            Tijuana over the past year, Mexican officials, have not been able to 
            apprehend key traffickers working for the Arellano Felix 
            organization. In November 1999, major Gulf cartel drug trafficker 
            Osiel Cardenas Guillen illegally detained and assaulted two U.S. 
            drug enforcement agents in Matamoros, Mexico, across the 
            international border from Brownsville, Texas. </P>
            <P>Methamphetamine traffickers, oftentimes associated with major 
            Mexican organized crime groups, obtain the precursor chemicals 
            necessary for methamphetamine production from sources in other 
            countries, such as China and India, as well as from rogue chemical 
            suppliers in the United States. In fact, Mexico-based transnational 
            criminal organizations have become the most significant distributors 
            in the U.S. of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. Several 
            bulk ephedrine seizures destined for Mexico have focused attention 
            on the magnitude of ephedrine acquisition by Mexican organized crime 
            groups. Methamphetamine super labs, capable of producing hundreds of 
            pounds of methamphetamine on a weekly basis, are established in 
            Mexico or in California, where the methamphetamine is provided to 
            traffickers to distribute across the United States. </P>
            <P>Heroin from Mexico now represents 14% of the heroin seized in the 
            United States by federal authorities, and it is estimated that 43 
            metric tons of opium gum was produced in 1999 in Mexico. A recent 
            study conducted by the DEA indicates that as much as 29% of the 
            heroin being used in the U.S. is being smuggled in by the 
            Mexico-based organized crime syndicates. Mexican black tar heroin is 
            produced in Mexico, and transported over the border in cars and 
            trucks. Like cocaine and methamphetamine, it is trafficked by 
            associates of the organized criminal groups in Mexico, and provided 
            to dealers and users in the Southwest, Northwest, and Midwest areas 
            of the United States. At one time, it was commonplace for couriers 
            to carry two pounds or so of heroin into the United States; 
            recently, quantities of heroin seized from individuals have 
            increased as is evidenced by larger seizures in a number of towns in 
            Texas. This heroin is extremely potent, and its use has resulted in 
            a significant number of deaths. </P>
            <P>Marijuana from Mexico still dominates the illicit U.S. import 
            market although U.S. experts estimate Mexico&rsquo;s marijuana 
            production at 3,700 metric tons (compared with 4,600 in 1998 and 
            4,800 in 1997). In addition, during 1999, the GOM eradicated some 
            23,547 hectares of marijuana (down from 24,200 in 1998). Seizures of 
            Mexican marijuana have increased from 102 metric tons in 1991 to 
            836.3 metric tons in 1999. Marijuana organizations from Mexico are 
            very powerful and violent. In some places, traffickers from Mexico 
            have established marijuana cultivation operations within the United 
            States. In a recent case in Idaho, DEA , working with other Federal, 
            state and local law enforcement officials, arrested a group of 
            illegal aliens from Zacatecas, Mexico. A total of 114,000 marijuana 
            plants, weighing almost 20 tons, was seized. This operation 
            represented the largest marijuana seizure ever in the state of 
            Idaho. </P>
            <P>It is important to note that although many of the transactions 
            relating to the drug trade take place on U.S. soil, the major 
            organized crime bosses direct each and every detail of their 
            multi-billion dollar business while situated in Mexico. They are 
            responsible not only for the business decisions being made, but also 
            ultimately for the devastation that many American communities have 
            suffered as a result of the influx of cocaine, methamphetamine, 
            heroin and marijuana. These powerful and organized syndicates can 
            frustrate the ability of the Mexican anti-drug police. Their ability 
            to place obstacles such as corruption and unlimited resources in the 
            path of police can oftentimes impede investigations. In the past 
            year, none of the major Mexican trafficking organizations have been 
            dismantled or significantly disrupted by Mexican authorities. </P>
            <P><B>Law Enforcement Response:</B></P>
            <P>Reporting indicates that the Southwest border (SWB) remains a 
            major point of entry for approximately 70% of all illicit drugs 
            smuggled into our country by Mexican trafficking groups. In response 
            to this continued threat along the border, the DEA has established 
            several initiatives that facilitate and improve intelligence and 
            information sharing, while identifying and removing impediments to 
            cooperation. These initiatives employ a multi-pronged strategy, 
            which utilizes and combines law enforcement operations, intelligence 
            operations, and provides for law enforcement assistance in order to 
            achieve success in combating criminal drug trafficking organizations 
            along the border. The objective of these initiatives is to disrupt 
            and ultimately dismantle criminal organizations that smuggle illicit 
            drugs into the U.S. by linking Federal, state and local 
            investigations domestically and mobilizing multilateral enforcement 
            efforts abroad. Based upon past trends, intelligence, and recent 
            seizures along the border, the DEA has established the following 
            priorities for the SWB Field Divisions: (1) cocaine investigations 
            involving violent organizations; (2) methamphetamine investigations, 
            (3) heroin investigations, (4) marijuana investigations, (5) money 
            laundering investigations and (6) diverted/dangerous drug and 
            chemical investigations. </P>
            <P><B>Enforcement Operations/Strategies:</B></P>
            <P>In response to the emergence of these Mexican Drug Trafficking 
            Organization&rsquo;s (MDTO), it became apparent that a coordinated 
            strategy for law enforcement counterdrug activities needed to be 
            implemented. In order to combat drug production and trafficking 
            networks operating along the U.S./Mexican border, DEA, in concert 
            with other Federal agencies, established the Southwest Border 
            Initiative &ndash; an integrated, coordinated law enforcement effort 
            designed to attack the command and control structure of organized 
            criminal operations associated with the Mexican Federation. This 
            strategy focuses on intelligence and enforcement efforts which 
            target drug distribution systems within the U.S. and directs 
            resources toward the disruption of those principal drug trafficking 
            organizations operating across the border. </P>
            <P>As such, DEA, in cooperation with other Federal, state and local 
            law enforcement agencies is focusing increased intelligence, 
            technical resources and investigative expertise on the major 
            MDTO&rsquo;s responsible for smuggling vast quantities of cocaine, 
            heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine across the border. </P>
            <P>Apart from this effort, DEA and the Federal Bureau of 
            Investigation (FBI) also provide assistance in the form of 
            operational planning, intelligence and training to Government of 
            Mexico (GOM) law enforcement authorities, to strengthen their 
            capacity to combat these organizations. The Southwest Border 
            strategy targets specific Mexican trafficking organizations 
            operating across the border and attacks their command and control 
            infrastructures wherever they operate. </P>
            <P>Further, the Special Operations Division (SOD) is a joint 
            national coordinating and support entity comprised of agents, 
            analysts, and prosecutors from DOJ, Customs, FBI, DEA and IRS. Its 
            mission is to coordinate and support regional and national criminal 
            investigations and prosecutions against trafficking organizations 
            that most threaten the U.S. SOD performs seamlessly across both 
            investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries, 
            providing field offices with necessary support, assistance, 
            intelligence analysis and &ldquo;leads&rdquo; for investigative 
            action. Within SOD, no distinction is made among the participating 
            investigative agencies. Where appropriate, state and local 
            authorities are fully integrated into coordinated operations. As 
            presently configured, SOD consists of five sections; each of which 
            has both DEA, FBI and USCS personnel assigned. One section targets 
            Colombian Trafficking Organizations, a second concentrates on 
            cocaine and heroin trafficking in Europe and Asia, a third targets 
            money laundering organizations and the remaining two sections are 
            the heart of the Southwest Border Project and focus their efforts on 
            the principal MDTO&rsquo;s. These two sections target, among other 
            things, the command and control networks of the identified 
            MDTO&rsquo;s, and their supporting organizations operating along the 
            Southwest border. As such, the interagency regional objectives are 
            as follows; (1) Intelligence collection and analysis, (2) 
            Investigations, (3) Interdiction and Enforcement and (4) Prosecution 
            and Incarceration. The following operation delineates the need and 
            significance for such a multi-agency project: </P>
            <P><B>Operation Impunity: </B></P>
            <P>In September 1999, the DEA announced the conclusion of a two-year 
            international investigation that culminated in the arrest of over 
            106 individuals linked to the Amado Carrillo Fuentes (ACF) drug 
            trafficking organization, headquartered in Cancun, Mexico. This 
            investigation, known as &ldquo;Operation Impunity,&rdquo; was a 
            multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency investigation which directly 
            linked drug trafficking activity in the United States to the highest 
            level of the Mexican cocaine trade. </P>
            <P>This investigation began in January 1998 and was conducted 
            jointly by the DEA, FBI, USCS, U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, 
            DOJ/Criminal Division and a host of state and local law enforcement 
            agencies. The investigation encompassed 53 DEA, FBI and USCS case 
            investigations which spans 14 Federal judicial districts. Since 
            1998, this investigation has resulted in 36 seizures, netting 12,434 
            kilograms of cocaine, a half a kilo of heroin, 4,806 pounds of 
            marijuana, more than $19 million in U.S. currency, and the arrest of 
            106 individuals. </P>
            <P>The above statistics only tell part of the story. Operation 
            Impunity demonstrated an unparalleled coordinated and cooperative 
            effort among the law enforcement community. Overall, this 
            investigation allowed the law enforcement community to ascertain 
            this organization&rsquo;s method of operation from the narcotic 
            distribution in Colombia to the transportation through Mexico to the 
            ultimate distribution networks throughout the U.S. Such success 
            clearly demonstrates the need for the continuation of long term, 
            multi-agency investigations. </P>
            <P><B>Cooperative Efforts with the Government of Mexico/Status of 
            Vetted Units:</B></P>
            <P>Subsequent to the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo in 1997 and 
            the establishment of mechanisms within the Mexican law enforcement 
            infrastructure, such as the Bilateral Task Forces (BTFs) and the 
            Vetted Unit program, DEA became cautiously optimistic relative to 
            the prospects of the GOM&rsquo;s commitment to bilateral 
            investigations. The DEA has supported these programs financially and 
            with other resources in hope that our efforts would result in a 
            successful attack against the drug lords who are creating so much 
            havoc throughout communities in the United States. However, 
            continuing reports of corruption and the rapidly growing power and 
            influence of the major organized criminal groups in Mexico cause us 
            great concern about the long-term prospects for success. Perhaps, 
            the arrest of Operation Impunity target Jaime Aguilar Gastelum and 
            Operation Millennium target Guillermo Moreno-Rios, by Mexican 
            authorities, is indicative of the GOM&rsquo;s future commitment to 
            such joint ventures.</P>
            <P>However, in the last year the Vetted Units Program in Mexico has 
            not achieved the potential as originally envisioned by both 
            governments. In order to address this issue, the DEA and the 
            Government of Mexico&rsquo;s equivalent to the DEA, the Fiscalia 
            Especializada Para la Atencion de Delitos Contra la Salud (FEADS), 
            have agreed to carefully review the Program and establish ways to 
            improve its efficiency and effectiveness against mutually agreed 
            investigative targets. The DEA also provides support and assistance 
            to the FEADS to conduct investigative endeavors throughout Mexico. 
            These investigations are being conducted with the primary 
            investigative component of the FEADS vetted units -&ndash;the 
            Bilateral Task Forces (BTF&rsquo;s). </P>
            <P>Unfortunately, the investigative achievements by the BTF and the 
            Sensitive Investigations Unit (SIU) as related to cases against the 
            major drug trafficking organizations are minimal. The inability of 
            these units to fully employ the new investigative techniques and 
            authorities provided in the Organized Crime Law to investigate these 
            major organizations has been equally disappointing. Further 
            complicating investigative efforts, the Mexico City-based SIU was 
            compromised in February 1999 by a Mexican news expos&eacute; 
            describing the operations of that unit, to include its location, 
            activities and investigative targets. Because of this setback, the 
            SIU has been largely shut down. In addition, throughout 1999 police 
            personnel from the Mexico City SIU were separated into smaller 
            groups and often deployed to various regions throughout Mexico in 
            order to work other investigations, such as the search for Mexico 
            fugitive and former Governor of the State of Quintana Roo Mario 
            Villanueva-Madrid. </P>
            <P>On a positive note, vetted unit personnel of the Organized Crime 
            Unit (OCU), of which the SIU is a part, have been investigating a 
            drug smuggling network of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization in 
            Cancun, headed by Alcides Ramon-Magana. During the course of this 
            investigation, DEA has shared three principal witnesses with the OCU 
            who have provided information regarding this organization . The 
            information gleaned from these witnesses has contributed to the 
            seizure of real estate in Quintana Roo and the arrest of several 
            defendants in this case, including mid-level drug trafficker and 
            money-launderer Carlos Colin-Padilla. In addition, the GOM issued 
            arrest warrants for a total of 44 individuals associated with 
            Ramon-Magana including an arrest warrant issued on April 5, 1999, 
            against former Governor Villanueva Madrid on 28 counts of drug 
            related offenses. </P>
            <P>The governments of Mexico and the United States will continue to 
            work cooperatively on investigations. Just this month, based upon 
            information provided by the DEA to the GOM, two such operations were 
            conducted, resulting in the seizure of a cocaine laboratory and a 
            methamphetamine laboratory in Mexico. Ultimately, DEA believes that 
            the vetting process is our best chance at ensuring integrity with 
            our counterparts. As mentioned in previous testimony today with 
            respect to the ongoing bilateral Vetted Units Program survey, DEA 
            will remain actively engaged with our GOM counterparts relative to 
            this process. DEA will also encourage the GOM to fully staff and 
            support the BTFs and the SIUs with FEADS personnel that have already 
            been vetted and to supply the resources that these operations 
            require. </P>
            <P><B>Corruption Issues:</B></P>
            <P>Although the Mexican government is attempting to address the 
            issue of corruption, it continues to be a serious problem in Mexican 
            law enforcement institutions. The Federal Preventive Police (FPP) 
            was created in early 1999 in response to the existing corruption in 
            the police ranks, but recently reported that several FPP agents were 
            under investigation for corrupt activities. In December 1999 the 
            Government of Mexico/PGR reported that between April 1997 through 
            1999 more than 1,400 of the 3,500 federal police officers had been 
            fired for corruption and that 357 of the officers had been 
            prosecuted. Additionally, the National Public Safety System 
            established a national police registry to prevent corrupt police 
            officials from being rehired by another law enforcement entity. 
            However, the PGR has not fully implemented these programs to deal 
            with corruption. For example, in 1999, the former Director of 
            Investigations for the PGR&rsquo;s SIU and OCU, Cuauhtemoc Herrera 
            Suastegui, was reassigned to a high-level position within the PGR 
            despite failing polygraph examination in 1998. Although several 
            FEADS vetted &ldquo;floater&rdquo; units have had several successes 
            during 1999, the Vetted Unit Program failed to adhere to internal 
            security principles involving the polygraph process, which may lead 
            to potential compromises and corruption. The Mexican military also 
            has experienced narco-related corruption within its ranks. </P>
            <P>As of July 1999, an amendment to the Judicial Organic law 
            mandated that PGR officers, prosecutors, police agents, experts, and 
            pilots assigned to narcotics eradication duties are required to 
            undergo an evaluation process, to include background checks and 
            polygraphs. </P>
            <P>Judicial efforts to stop corruption are also underway. On January 
            11, 2000, a Mexican Federal judge issued an arrest warrant for the 
            magistrate who wrongly freed Adan Amezcua-Contreras, a major 
            methamphetamine trafficker. </P>
            <P>Perhaps the most alarming incident involving Mexican officials 
            occurred on November 9, 1999, when a DEA Special Agent, along with a 
            FBI Special Agent debriefed a Confidential Source in Matamoros, 
            Mexico. During the course of this debriefing the Special Agents and 
            Confidential Source were surrounded and physically threatened by 
            Mexican trafficker Osiel Cardenas-Guillen and approximately 15 
            associates. Each of these associates, one brandishing a gold-plated 
            automatic assault weapon, were either municipal or state police 
            officers. Furthermore, despite monitoring the entire incident over 
            the DEA Special Agent&rsquo;s cellular telephone, which had been 
            used to call for assistance, the Tamaulipas State Judicial Police 
            Commander took no action. Due in large part to their resourcefulness 
            and ability to diffuse this dangerous situation, were the agents and 
            the confidential source able to survive unscathed. Among other 
            issues, this incident highlights the vulnerability of DEA and FBI 
            Special Agents working in Mexico. </P>
            <P><B>Status of Extraditions:</B></P>
            <P>The principal leaders of major drug trafficking organizations 
            fear the threat of extradition to the United States more than any 
            other law enforcement or judicial tool. Extradition of significant 
            traffickers ensures that those responsible for the command and 
            control of illicit activities, including drug smuggling and money 
            laundering, will be held totally accountable for their actions and 
            serve a prison sentence commensurate with their crimes. </P>
            <P>No major drug traffickers were extradited to the United States in 
            1999. The Mexican Government did extradite 10 fugitives on narcotics 
            related or money laundering offenses in 1999 -- eight U.S. citizens 
            and two Mexican citizens. One Mexican citizen, a drug trafficker, 
            was sought on drug charges after escaping from a U. S. prison while 
            serving a sentence on drug related crimes. The other Mexican 
            citizen, who killed a United States Border Patrol agent, was sought 
            on murder and marijuana smuggling charges.</P>
            <P>In September 1998, the Government of Mexico arrested U.S. Citizen 
            and DEA fugitive Randall Jeffrey Spradling in Guadalajara which, 
            given Spradling&rsquo;s strong ties to both Mexican and Colombian 
            drug traffickers, was an important event. He is fighting extradition 
            to the United States. </P>
            <P>In the past twelve months, some Mexican Courts have denied 
            extradition of significant drug traffickers, such as Jaime 
            Ladino-Avila, to the U.S. due to a variety of reasons, such as a 
            very dated legal precedent holding life imprisonment 
            unconstitutional in Mexico. At the end of 1999, there were 
            approximately 40 persons in Mexican custody and subject to 
            extradition proceedings based on U.S. provisional arrest warrants 
            and extradition requests. </P>
            <P><B>Conclusion: The Road Ahead:</B></P>
            <P>he United States&rsquo; long experience with confronting and 
            dismantling organized criminal activity has necessitated the 
            development of an aggressive, cohesive and coordinated strategy to 
            identify, target, arrest and incapacitate the leadership of these 
            organizations. DEA=s role in addressing the drug problem is to 
            continue to attack the leadership of these international criminal 
            organizations. With a strategy consisting of mounting attacks on the 
            organizational command and control of major Mexican trafficking 
            syndicates that operate along the U.S./Mexico border, the DEA is 
            able to attack the ability of these organizations to conduct 
            business and impede their efforts to import drugs into the U.S.</P>
            <P>The effectiveness of national and bilateral efforts against drug 
            organizations will depend largely on demonstrable progress in 
            disrupting and dismantling these transnational narco-trafficking 
            organizations. This includes apprehending, prosecuting and 
            convicting major drug traffickers, as well as exercising extradition 
            laws against those defendants facing federal drug trafficking 
            charges in the United States, and exposing and prosecuting 
            individuals and businesses involved in providing critical support 
            networks such as front companies, security, transportation and the 
            like. </P>
            <P>Therefore, it is imperative for law enforcement to continue to 
            facilitate the flow of information and intelligence while 
            identifying and removing impediments to cooperation. In this vein, 
            it is vital for the DEA, along with other USG agencies, to continue 
            to support the GOM in the field of counternarcotics operations. In 
            turn, DEA encourages and expects the GOM to provide adequate 
            investigative manpower, ongoing integrity testing, financial 
            resources, equipment and reciprocal drug intelligence in support of 
            bilateral drug law enforcement, which should significantly improve 
            both governments&rsquo; ability to counter and eliminate 
            transnational drug trafficking organizations. </P>
            <P>However, the true sign of success regarding anti-drug efforts in 
            Mexico is best recognized with tangible results from concerted law 
            enforcement efforts, i.e. the arrest and successful prosecution of 
            significant leaders of these major drug cartels in Mexico and; where 
            applicable, their extradition to the United States to face federal 
            drug trafficking charges. We are not yet there. </P>
            <P><B>Part II:</B></P>
            <P>As an addendum to the drug trafficking assessment on Mexico, 
            included are abbreviated drug situation reports on six countries. 
            These countries were selected due to the Administrations recent 
            announcement either de-certifying (Afghanistan and Burma) or 
            certifying due to vital U.S. interests ( Haiti, Paraguay, Cambodia 
            and Nigeria). These reports include criteria and guidelines that may 
            be evaluated during the certification process. </P>
            <P><B>Paraguay:</B></P>
            <P>Paraguay&rsquo;s primary role in the cocaine trade is as a 
            transit country. Traffickers send shipments of Bolivian cocaine HCl 
            and base through Paraguay into Brazil and Argentina for further 
            shipment to the United States and Europe. Recent information also 
            indicates that there is some trafficking of cocaine essential 
            chemicals from Paraguay into Bolivia.</P>
            <P>Paraguayan cocaine traffickers serve primarily as facilitators 
            for major Bolivian and Brazilian cocaine organizations. Paraguayan 
            transportation groups have, on occasion, provided aircraft and 
            pilots to transportation groups operating between Peru, Brazil, and 
            Colombia. A common exchange method for Paraguayan traffickers is to 
            trade luxury cars stolen in Asuncion and Argentina for Bolivian 
            cocaine. This makes the capital for large cocaine purchases 
            relatively easy to obtain and allows Bolivian traffickers to launder 
            their profits directly into tangible assets. </P>
            <P>Counter-drug efforts in Paraguay are consolidated under the 
            direction of the Secretariat Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), a Federal 
            agency with national authority to propose legislation, conduct 
            anti-drug education programs, control the diversion of chemicals and 
            drugs, and to conduct drug investigations and operations, including 
            eradication efforts. In February 2000 Retired Army Colonel Hugo 
            Ibarra was appointed as the director of SENAD. In spite of 
            continuing political turmoil within the government, Ibarra has 
            displayed some willingness to conduct investigations into drug 
            trafficking and has cooperated with the DEA in mainly low level 
            investigations. </P>
            <P>The Anti-Narcotics Directorate of the Paraguayan National Police 
            (DINAR) is a full-time investigative unit consisting of 
            approximately 100 police special agent personnel. DINAR is 
            controlled organizationally and financially by SENAD. The DEA 
            Asuncion Country Office (ACO) utilizes both organizations to conduct 
            investigations and operations. The formation of a DEA-sponsored 
            investigation/intelligence unit within the DINAR has enhanced the 
            ability of the ACO to conduct more sensitive investigations and to 
            properly train and equips this smaller and more secure unit.</P>
            <P>A criminal code promulgated in 1997 went into effect in November 
            of 1998. The new code provided sentencing guidelines for money 
            laundering offenses. Asset seizures are also provided for under 
            Paraguayan law, but the law is very new and has only been minimally 
            used. In 1998, the Government of Paraguay signed an extradition 
            treaty with the United States, which includes a provision for the 
            extradition of nationals. The government also drafted legislation 
            that explicitly authorizes undercover operations and controlled 
            deliveries. Due to the political instability in Paraguay the 
            proposed legislation remains pending. </P>
            <P><B>Burma:</B></P>
            <P>In 1999, Burma was named as the world&rsquo;s number two producer 
            of opium behind Afghanistan. The 1999 CNC Opium Yield Survey, 
            conducted jointly with US and Burmese officials estimated the 1999 
            potential opium yield to be 1,090 metric tons. This reflects a 38% 
            decrease from 1998 survey estimates of 1,750 metric tons. In 
            February 2000, the CNC, Embassy and Host Nation officials conducted 
            the 2000 Opium Yield Survey with the DEA as an accompanied observer. 
            </P>
            <P>Burma continues to be a major producer of both heroin and 
            methamphetamine. Burma accounts for approximately 80 percent of the 
            total production of Southeast Asian opium. In 1999, the Government 
            of Burma (GOB) seized 273 kilograms of heroin, down from 490 
            kilograms in 1998. The decrease in seizures is partly due to opium 
            crop reduction, directly attributed to severe drought conditions. 
            Also attributed is the response by the GOB against narcotic 
            traffickers, in response to intelligence information provided by 
            DEA. The increased enforcement activity on behalf of the GOB has 
            resulted in the traffickers&rsquo; utilization of smaller and highly 
            mobile opium refineries. </P>
            <P>In 1999, the GOB seized in approximately 28.8 million tablets 
            (approximately 2,880 kilograms) of methamphetamine. During 1998, the 
            GOB seized 16 million tablets (approximately 1,600 kilograms). 
            Additionally, in 1999, the GOB sseized 6.43 metric tons of 
            ephedrine. The GOB continues to pursue additional ephedrine 
            smuggling investigations. </P>
            <P>Methamphetamine produced in Burma is shipped almost exclusively 
            to Thailand. The largest and most recent reported seizure in 
            Thailand was 4.3 million tablets (approx. 430 kilograms) on March 
            14, 2000. There have been six reported seizures of Burmese produced 
            methamphetamine, ranging from 200 to 7,800 tablets among the Hmong 
            and Mien communities residing in California. </P>
            <P>The United States Government policy towards Burma continues to 
            link political change toward democracy and human rights issues with 
            the narcotics problem. Currently minimal assistance is provided to 
            Burma by the U.S. largely through assistance to law enforcement 
            operations and to intelligence sharing by DEA with host government 
            counterparts. Training, utilizing INL funds, has been prohibited 
            since 1989. </P>
            <P>The DEA Rangoon Country Office (RCO) has developed a working 
            relationship with their Host Nation Counterparts (Directorate of 
            Defense Services Intelligence /DDSI and State Peace and Development 
            Council/SPDC). </P>
            <P>Intelligence indicates that corruption is rampant in Burma. This 
            situation has led to petty graft and corruption. However, the 
            government has taken positive steps to solve this problem by 
            aggressively prosecuting and punishing violators determined to be 
            involved in corrupt practices. </P>
            <P><B>Cambodia:</B></P>
            <P>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enjoys a good 
            relationship with the Cambodian National Police and the National 
            Police Anti-Drug Unit. The Anti-Drug Unit is unable to carry out any 
            type of sophisticated investigation due to the lack of financial 
            resources, extreme shortage of trained personnel and lack of 
            adequate investigative equipment. </P>
            <P>Cambodia is not a major producer of narcotics although large 
            amounts of marijuana are cultivated with multi-ton quantities being 
            exported to Europe. Marijuana production and trafficking is not 
            considered to be a major threat to the United States. In 1997, 
            enforcement efforts resulted in the disruption and dismantling of a 
            group of Americans identified to be sending multi ton quantities of 
            marijuana from Cambodia to the West Coast of the U.S. The 
            investigation resulted in the arrest of several of its members and 
            the seizure of approximately six (6) tons of marijuana in Cambodia 
            in June of that year. U.S. and Cambodian defendants were 
            subsequently indicted in the U.S. Despite the fact that Cambodia has 
            no extradition treaty with the U.S., the Cambodian government 
            deported the above defendants to the U.S. to stand trial. Through a 
            cooperative effort, the Government of Cambodia (GOC) allowed DEA 
            agents to interview the defendant's prior to their deportation to 
            the U.S. In addition to the above, the GOC allowed two of their 
            officers to travel to the U.S. and testify in a U.S. Federal Court. 
            </P>
            <P>There is little hard intelligence or information available on 
            heroin trafficking involving Cambodia. There have been no 
            significant heroin seizures in the U.S. either transiting through or 
            initiated from Cambodia. </P>
            <P>Corruption has been identified as an endemic problem in Cambodia, 
            and has adversely affected drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and 
            ill-trained police and judicial officials have been all-too-easy to 
            look the other way in narcotics and other criminal cases. </P>
            <P>Cambodia established a ANational Authority for Combating Drugs@ 
            and a ASpecial Drug Enforcement Unit@ in the Ministry of the 
            Interior. The appointed heads of these units currently do not have 
            any law enforcement units directly under their control, but do have 
            the ability to call on resources from other enforcement agencies. 
            The National Police remain DEA's primary contact. </P>
            <P>This year, the DEA&rsquo;s Office of International Training is 
            scheduled to put on the Basic Investigators Training Seminar. The 
            seminar will include approximately sixty (60) National Police 
            Officers. </P>
            <P><B>Nigeria:</B></P>
            <P>The Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLA) has 
            provided some cooperation to DEA in those areas where it can. The 
            most basic of drug law enforcement equipment is unavailable to the 
            NDLEA. The NDLEA continues to be underfunded, undertrained and 
            underpaid by the Government of Nigeria (GON), calling into question 
            the GON&rsquo;s own will to attack and prosecute major drug 
            traffickers operating in Nigeria.</P>
            <P>NDLEA officials continued to arrest low level couriers and 
            growers. Major traffickers and organizations were largely 
            unaffected. This is due to the lack of training and modern equipment 
            needed to identify, locate, monitor and investigate the activities 
            of the major drug traffickers operating in Nigeria. </P>
            <P>Officials of the GON are quick to point to their yearly seizure 
            statistics, which are slightly misleading. For example, in 1998 the 
            NDLEA reports that they seized &ldquo;over 10 tons of 
            narcotics&rdquo;, which, taken at face value, appears to be an 
            impressive statistic. When urged to provide a breakdown of the drug 
            types seized, it is discovered that nine of those metric tons were 
            cannabis, 503 kilograms were unspecified psychotropic drugs, 17 
            kilograms were cocaine and only 3 kilograms, seized for the entire 
            year, were heroin. </P>
            <P>The bulk of the cannabis seizures are a result of an active plant 
            eradication program. The cannabis products are destined for local 
            consumption and exportation to neighboring African countries, and 
            some to various destinations in Europe. While it is a source of 
            pride for the GON, the cannabis seizures have little impact on the 
            United States. </P>
            <P>The NDLEA attempts to prosecute narcotics and money laundering 
            violators, but are stymied by a dysfunctional judicial system and 
            occasionally by government corruption. </P>
            <P>Although there have been asset seizures in the past, a weakness 
            in the law does not allow for asset forfeiture without a prior 
            conviction of the owner of the asset. Since convictions are rare, no 
            drug related forfeitures have been reported.</P>
            <P><B>Afghanistan:</B></P>
            <P>The political situation in Afghanistan has adversely affected 
            DEA's strategy and enforcement efforts. Due to security reasons, the 
            Department of State has prohibited travel to Afghanistan for all of 
            this year. Until Special Agents can travel to Afghanistan, accurate 
            reporting will be sporadic and unconfirmed. Currently, there are no 
            ongoing counter narcotics programs or any cooperation in 
            nvestigations underway between the U.S. and Afghanistan. Illegal 
            drug production in Afghanistan, however, remains a major problem 
            which must be addressed.</P>
            <P>Drug traffickers in Afghanistan are both the world largest 
            producers of illicit opium and major producers of cannabis products. 
            In the absence of a stable and universally recognized central 
            government and the tolerance of poppy cultivation and conversion 
            laboratories by the Taliban, cultivation of opium poppies is likely 
            to increase in Afghanistan. </P>
            <P>According to the U.S. Government, 51,500 hectares of opium poppy 
            were cultivated in 1999, versus 41,720 hectares in 1998, a 23% 
            increase. From this an estimated 1,670 metric tons of opium were 
            produced, versus 1,350 last year, a 24% increase. The increase 
            results from favorable economic and environmental conditions, in 
            particular high opium prices during the planting season combined 
            with ideal weather conditions during harvest. </P>
            <P>During 1999, representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, to 
            include DEA, have met several times with the Taliban High 
            Commissioner for Narcotics Control. In a recent meeting, the Taliban 
            High Commissioner for Narcotics stated that the Taliban government 
            had taken measures to eliminate narcotics. He claimed that the 
            government had recently seized 2,000 kilograms of opium and heroin 
            and had destroyed 34 laboratories. Other significant hauls have 
            taken place at various airports and border areas under Taliban 
            control. A recent Taliban edict strongly admonished farmers to 
            reduce poppy cultivation by one-third in the year 2000. A common 
            complaint by the Taliban government is that the international 
            community does not give the Taliban due credit for these successes. 
            The Taliban High Commissioner for Narcotics also denied reports that 
            the Taliban tax opium production. </P>
            <P>Afghanistan remains essentially a country divided into regions 
            controlled by tribal leaders, all of whose support is necessary to 
            effectively rule the country. Afghanistan is not a center for money 
            laundering and financial institutions barely exist. Due to the total 
            destruction of the Afghan economy, narcotic traffickers often use 
            proceeds to purchase goods abroad and smuggle these items into 
            Afghanistan </P>
            <P>Afghanistan continues to be a major recipient of multi-ton 
            quantities of acetic anhydride, which is an essential chemical in 
            the production of heroin. Shipments of acetic anhydride arrive 
            regularly for such purported usage as leather tanning and machine 
            cleaning. As there are no known legitimate businesses in Afghanistan 
            utilizing acetic anhydride, these consignments are highly suspect. 
            Chemicals used in heroin processing laboratories in Afghanistan 
            usually are imported from India, Germany and the former Soviet 
            Union. Some progress has been made in the tracking of shipments from 
            western countries. Several manufacturers have recently been 
            cooperating and advising DEA of suspect deliveries destined for 
            Southwest Asia. </P>
            <P><B>Haiti:</B></P>
            <P>Haiti continues to be a transshipment and storage site for 
            multi-hundred kilogram quantities of cocaine from South and Central 
            America. The country&rsquo;s long coastline, mountainous interior, 
            numerous uncontrolled airstrips, and its 193-mile border with the 
            Dominican Republic, as well as its location in the Caribbean, make 
            it an excellent transit site for drug shipments from Colombia 
            destined for the United States.</P>
            <P>Colombian traffickers are the major players in the drug 
            transportation business in Haiti. As a result, Colombians 
            organizations have become entrenched in Haiti, and have cultivated 
            long-standing relationships with Haitian and Dominican traffickers 
            in order to facilitate their activities. </P>
            <P>Colombian traffickers, operating through Haitian contacts, 
            transport multi hundred-kilogram quantities of cocaine through the 
            southern coast of Haiti. Colombian traffickers are divided into two 
            groups; those who have lived in Haiti for some time and control drug 
            operations and those who routinely travel to Haiti aboard commercial 
            aircraft and vessels. </P>
            <P>The three primary methods for smuggling drugs into Haiti are 
            noncommercial air methods, noncommercial maritime activities 
            (primarily go-fast operations transiting from Colombia to 
            Haiti&rsquo;s Southern Claw) and containerized cargo on freighters 
            or commercial/passenger aircraft. As drugs enter Haiti, they are 
            stored locally until they can be shipped to the United States or 
            Europe. Drugs are smuggled out of Haiti via coastal freighters or 
            containerized shipping. The primary shipping routes are: </P>
            <P>Directly to the Miami River/South Florida area from one of 
            several Haitian ports such as Port-au-Prince, Miragoane, St. Marc, 
            Gonaives, Cap Haitien or Port de Paix. The drugs are typically 
            secreted in hidden compartments within coastal freighters. </P>
            <P>Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and 
            then smuggled across the Mona Passage into Puerto Rico via small 
            vessels. Once in Puerto Rico, the illicit drugs are then hidden in 
            containerized cargo and shipped to the United States or Europe. </P>
            <P>Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and 
            them smuggled into the United States or Europe via containerized 
            cargo. Jimani, Pederales, Malpaso, Dajabon and Pepilo Salcedo are 
            the border points that are most frequently crossed. </P>
            <P>Between May 1998 and January 2000, approximately 3,850 kilograms 
            of cocaine has been seized off of 16 vessels coming into the Miami 
            River from Haiti. In addition, on March 16, 1999, approximately 1.3 
            million dollars, which had been destined for Haiti, was seized on 
            the Miami River off of the M/V Lady Crystal. On January 31, 2000, an 
            additional $1 million, which was destined for Haiti, was 
    seized.</P>
