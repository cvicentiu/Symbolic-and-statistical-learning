   Aid Organizations Criticize Germany's Afghanistan Plans

   Military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another, 
   say German non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers 
   into the Afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams.

   First food distribution begins as Liberian peace talks stall

   As food distributions continue in Monrovia, Liberian rebels have
   warned of renewed fighting if they fail to get some of the top
   government posts. Talks held in Ghana on Saturday ended in a
   deadlock over demands by the main rebel group for the posts of vice
   president and speaker in a new administration, which is due to take
   over power in October from an interim government. Meanwhile, in
   Liberia, the United Nation's World Food Programme handed out rations
   at five sites in the capital as another supply ship docked. But the
   Red Cross said many people were still unable to reach supply
   points.


   First food distribution begins as Liberian peace talks stall

   As food distributions continue in Monrovia, Liberian rebels have
   warned of renewed fighting if they fail to get some of the top
   government posts. Talks held in Ghana have been deadlocked over
   rebel demands for the posts of vice president and speaker in a new
   administration, which is due to take over power in October from an
   interim government. West African mediators have given the rebels
   until Sunday evening to reach deal. Meanwhile, in Liberia, the
   United Nation's World Food Programme has begun handing out food
   rations at five sites in the capital. Liberia's warring factions
   have agreed to allow humanitarian aid to flow into all parts of the
   country and to guarantee the safety of international aid workers.


   Palestinians to take back control of West Bank towns

   The Israeli army is due on Monday to hand over control of the West
   Bank towns of Jericho and Qalquilya to the Palestinians. Israeli
   officials said on Sunday the Palestinian Authority had boosted
   efforts to rein in militants, laying the groundwork for further
   Israeli army pull-backs. The handovers of Ramallah und Tulkarem are
   planned to take place in the upcoming weeks.


   Power blackout investigations focus on lack of containment

   Officials in the United States have said they found the likely cause
   of what triggered the biggest power failure in America's history.
   Three faulty high-voltage lines near Cleveland, Ohio now seem to be
   responsible, and officials now want to investigate why the situation
   was not brought under control sooner. Almost all power has been
   restored with the exception of some isolated communities. Experts
   estimate $750 million worth of business was lost on Thursday in New
   York alone. Altogether about 50 million people were hit by the power
   blackout.


   European hostages could be released as soon as Monday, paper says

   Algerian militants holding 14 European hostages in Mali could
   release them as early as Monday, according to a German newspaper on
   Sunday. Citing unnamed sources in Mali's capital Bamako, Germany's
   Bild am Sonntag newspaper said the release could happen on
   Monday after Malian officials travel to the border region with
   Algeria to negotiate with the militants. The hostages -- nine
   Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- are thought to be being held by
   an Algerian militant group known as the Salafist Group for Preaching
   and Combat (GSPC), who are fighting for a purist Islamist state.


   Several arrested in Indonesia in connection with Jakarta bombing

   Indonesian police have said they had arrested a number of people in
   connection with the bombing of a luxury hotel in Jakarta. Twelve
   people were killed and more than 150 others wounded when a suicide
   bomber carried out an attack on the Marriott Hotel two weeks ago.
   Police said the suspected Marriott suicide bomber, Asmar Latin Sani,
   28, came from Bengkulu. Sunday's arrests were made as Indonesia was
   preparing to celebrate its anniversary of independence from the
   Netherlands amid tight security.


   Water pipeline breach follows oil pipeline blast

   The reconstruction of Iraq has suffered another setback. A major
   water pipeline in northern Baghdad was breached on Sunday,
   flooding nearby streets and cutting off the supply to parts of the
   city. Locals say they heard a bomb blast and a car speeding away
   afterwards. Meanwhile, the US army says one of Iraq's most important
   oil pipelines could remain out of order for up to a month. A part of
   the giant pipeline to Turkey was blown on Friday just two days after
   it was reopened. Iraq's top oil official, Thamer Ghadgban, said
   evidence pointed to sabotage. The sabotage of fuel pipelines, power
   cables and water pipes is undermining attempts by the U.S.-led
   administration to rebuild Iraq's public services.


   Iraqis killed in mortar attack

   Six Iraqis have been killed in a mortar bomb attack at a prison on
   the outskirts of Baghdad. The mortar fell into the yard of the
   U.S.-guarded Abu Ghraib prison. It was not clear who was behind
   Saturday night's attack, although U.S. occupiers have attributed a
   guerrilla campaign against them in Iraq to a mixture of Saddam
   loyalists and foreign Islamic militants.


   Danish and Iraqi soldiers killed near Basra

   Two Iraqis and a Danish soldier serving in the international 
   stabilisation force in Iraq were shot dead near the Iraqi city of 
   Basra overnight. An army spokesman said this was the first Danish 
   soldier to be killed. The soldiers had been on a routine patrol when 
   they tried to stop eight looters who were steeling power cables. They 
   were killed while trying to arrest the thieves. In another incident, 
   two US soldiers were shot as they left a Baghdad restaurant but,an 
   army spokesman said, they were able to get medical help. Soldiers from 
   the US coalition are facing almost daily attacks, blamed on supporters 
   of Saddam Hussein's ousted regime. Several other attacks were reported 
   over the weekend in Baghdad and Mosul. Since May, at least 60 US 
   soldiers have been killed.


   Nepal peace talks open to end 7-year revolt

   Nepal's government and Maoist rebels have started a third round of
   talks amid heavy security in the town of Nepalgunj. The talks aim to
   end a seven year revolt that has led to the deaths of more than
   7,000 people and wrecked the economy of the Himalayan kingdom,
   keeping away investors and tourists. Maoist rebels, fighting to
   topple to constitutional monarchy, agreed to take part in Sunday
   talks after the government freed their top leaders last month. Talks
   in April and May failed to solve the differences. The Maoist are
   proposing an interim government that would draft a constitution
   defining the king's role


   Top Mexican drugs suspect arrested

   Authorities in Mexico say they have caught the country's most
   powerful drugs trafficking suspect, Armando Valencia, otherwise
   known as &quot;El Juanito&quot;. Mexico's prosecutor-general said Valencia's
   cartel, based in western Mexico, controlled at least half of the
   illicit drugs smuggling via Mexico into the United States, much of
   it cocaine from Colombia. Seven further suspects were also arrested
   on Friday during raids in northern Mexico. In 1999, Valencia escaped
   after being arrested. The USA wants his extradition.


   Passer-by discovers bomb in southern Moscow

   In Moscow, pedestrians discovered a bag containing five kilogram of
   explosives on a street in the city's south. Police sealed off the
   area and have removed the explosives. Moscow police have discovered
   several similar packages in recent times believed to be planted by
   Chechen separatists. Fourteen people were killed at a rock concert
   in a suicide attack in July, and a Chechen woman tried to blow up a
   restaurant in central Moscow.


   UAE court orders teenage girl flogged for adultery

   The United Arab Emirates supreme federal court has rejected an
   appeal by a 15-year-old girl to reverse a court sentence of 90
   lashes for adultery. The Sunday edition of the Gulf News daily said
   that the federal court upheld the ruling under Sharia law for the
   flogging. The girl had appealed twice against the sentence on the
   grounds that she was a juvenile. The court also sentenced a man, but
   no details of his punishment were published. Under Islamic Sharia
   law, punishment for adultery can range from flogging to death by
   stoning.


   Quake rocks Inner Mongolia

   An earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale has rocked northern
   China. Two people were killed and more than 50 were injured. The
   Xinhua news agency said several thousand homes had collapsed. The
   quake was felt as far as Beijing, 500 kilometres to the south of the
   epicentre. Up to 60 aftershocks have been recorded.


   Holocaust memorial takes shape

   Work has begun in Berlin on Germany's long-delayed Holocaust
   memorial to the six million Jews of Europe killed by the Nazis. On
   Saturday, American architect Peter Eisenman displayed the first ten
   pillars of a planned labyrinth that he said would convey the
   feelings of abandonment of those sent to Auschwitz. In total, 2,700
   concrete pillars in varying heights will be erected near the
   Brandenburg Gate. Underground, an information centre will list the
   names of Jews murdered. The memorial is due to be inaugurated in May
   2005, on the 60th anniversary of the end of World War Two.


   Iceland resumes whaling

   Iceland resumed whaling on Sunday for the first time in 14 years.
   The first of three whaling ships commissioned by the Icelandic
   Marine Research Institute to catch 38 minke whales left port this
   morning. Iceland says it must control the number of minke whales -
   about 43,000 - in its waters to protect fish stocks and the
   livelihood of fishermen. Many environmentalist groups and
   governments are criticising Iceland's decision. An international
   moratorium on whaling has been in place since 1986.


   All Blacks beat Australia, Leverkusen sustains comeback

   Bayer Leverkusen has continued its Bundesliga comeback by beating
   Hanover 4-nil. Leverkusen tops the table ahead of Dortmund and
   Bayern Munich. Its star recruit Roy Makaay failed to score as Bayern
   beat Bochum 2-nil. In rugby, New Zealand's All Blacks have beaten
   Australia 21-17 to retake the Bledisloe Cup. At hockey's Champions
   Trophy in Amsterdam, the host Netherlands beat India 4-3. India gave
   away their match lead as the Dutch netted all their goals in the
   final seven minutes. In the other opening match, Pakistan and
   Australia drew 4-all. And in boxing, Germany's Markus Beyer retained
   his newly-won WBC super-middleweight title. His Australian opponent
   Danny Green was disqualified for a head-butt.
