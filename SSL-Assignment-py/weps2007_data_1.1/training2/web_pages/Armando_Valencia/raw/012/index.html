Three major Mexican drug organizations are offering millions of dollars to have Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha killed, a top investigator from Macedo's office said in comments published Wednesday.<P> Santiago Vasconcelos, a deputy attorney general in charge of organized crime prosecution, told news media Tuesday that the traffickers from the Tijuana, Gulf, and so-called Milenio (Millenium) cartel also are targeting him.<P> "This is a backlash against the work that the attorney general's office and the Defense Department have been doing dismantling these criminal organizations," Vasconcelos was quoted by the Milenio newspaper as saying.<P> During the administration of President Vicente Fox, who took office in 2000, federal officials have made several important blows against drug traffickers, including arrests of major leaders in the three organizations named by Vasconcelos.<P> In 2002, Ramon Arellano Felix, the alleged "enforcer" of the Tijuana cartel, died in a shootout with police in the Pacific coast resort of Mazatlan. Weeks later, authorities arrested his brother Benjamin Arellano Felix, a principal cartel leader.<P> Nearly two weeks ago, antidrug agents arrested Jorge Aureliano Felix, believed to be the highest-ranking member of the Tijuana cartel after family members. U.S. officials had offered US2 million for his capture.<P> In March 2003, Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas was arrested, followed by the arrest in August 2003 of Armando Valencia, leader of the Milenio cartel, centered in central and west Mexico.<P> The Attorney General's office received some of the information regarding the price on Macedo and Vasconcelo's heads from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Vasconcelo said.<P>
