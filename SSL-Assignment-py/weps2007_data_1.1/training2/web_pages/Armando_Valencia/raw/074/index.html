<h3>100 pounds Marijuana seized</h3>
Local police who were tipped off about a large Marijuana shipment arriving soon in Utah County, staked out a Provo home and scored big time.<p>

They ended up confiscating more than 100 pounds of Marijuana with a street value of more than $200,000.<p>

"There are going to be alot of unhappy users this weekend," reports a police Sgt., adding that the drug dealer who fronted the money for the shipment could be getting angry about not getting what he ordered.<p> 

While he said the confiscated amount is considered large, "it would not last very long in Utah County; probably it would last a couple weeks."<p>

Seven adult men and one juvenile girl were arrested Wednesday afternoon on felony charges of suspicion of distributing Marijuana or other charges.<p>

In court Thursday morning, several suspects were being held without bail on Immigration and Naturalization Service holds, suspects of being illegal aliens.<p>

The Utah County Major Crime Task Force, said that after receiving tips from anonymous sources, a home in a block of Provo, was staked out.<p>

"We had information a shipment was coming to Provo, so we watched the house,"  Task force spokesman said. "And after vehicles left it, they were stopped for traffic violations and the drivers consented to searches."<p>

Records reveal that one driver of Provo, was initially stopped on suspicion of a taillight violation. But after officers found more than a pound of Marijuana in his car, he was booked into county jail on a felony Marijuana distribution charge.<p>

Clark said 2 pounds of Marijuana were seized from one car and about 6 pounds from another in Provo.<p>

Once police became aware of the drugs leaving the Provo home, officers obtained a search warrant from a district judge. Using a house key confiscated from one of the drivers, police secretly opened the door and raided the home around 4:30 p.m. without resistance from occupants.<p>

"We found about 68 pounds in the home," police said.<p>

Questioning of suspects led officers to stake out an Orem residence Wednesday night, and a vehicle leaving the residence was stopped and about 40 pounds of Marijuana seized.<p>

Witnesses in the Orem neighborhood said they watched officers unload bags of Marijuana from the car around 10:30 p.m. in Provo.<p>

Seven Mexican nationals and one 17-year old female were arrested. All were said to live in Provo, except one from Orem.<p> 

Police said that with a wholesale value of between $800-$1300 a pound, the total wholesale Marijuana value confiscated is estimated at around $115,500. Police claim actual street value as twice that.<p> 

Officers from several agencies, including the Utah County Major Crime Task Force, Orem and Provo police, Wasatch Front Task Force from Salt Lake County, as well as drug-sniffing dogs from American Fork Police Department.<p>

<h3>Mexico: Marijuana Growers And Drug Traffickers Set Fires In Mexico</h3><p>

MEXICO CITY -- The pall of white, acrid haze hanging over states from Texas to Florida is caused by Mexican farmers clearing land to plant corn - and Marijuana.<p> 

For weeks, fires have been raging throughout Mexico and much of Central America, choking cities, causing schools to close and airports in some areas to suspend operations.  Last week, the thick haze began moving north, affecting mostly the Gulf states but also reaching the Midwest.  In Texas, officials advised people to remain indoors to avoid the "hazardous" smoke.<p> 

Most of the blazes are set by farmers following the age-old tradition of burning overgrown cropland before the spring planting and May rains.  With this year's extremely dry and hot conditions in the region, many have burned out of control.<p>

But in a disturbing new development, this year Mexican officials say some of the fires are also being set by drug traffickers.  With 30,000 soldiers who might normally be sent out on drug interdiction missions being reassigned to help battle the fires, the drug traffickers are finding that the more fires burn, the easier it is for their merchandise to flow north.<p>

Yet some of the traffickers' fires also have an "agricultural" purpose, officials add: Land is being cleared for marijuana.  Last Friday in the Pacific state of Sinaloa, firefighters arriving at a raging blaze were shot at by farmers who didn't want the fire put out.  The fire was set to clear land for marijuana planting, but ended up burning out of control and was still blackening forested acreage over the weekend.<p>

Mexico has registered nearly 10,000 fires this year, which have charred more than a half-million acres, according to the environment secretariat.  That's more than 200 percent over the annual average for the past five years.  While part of the blackened earth is crop acreage, Mexico is also losing forest lands: Last week, a fire was burning out of control in the country's last virgin rain forest.<p>

Fires are also burning out of control in Honduras and Guatemala.<p>

Officials say the land is so dry this year as a result of the El Nino weather phenomenon that the fires are likely to continue until annual rains arrive later this month.  That apparent resignation may be one reason so little has been done up to now to stop the burning.  On Friday, Mexico accepted a belated offer of fire-fighting assistance made earlier in the week by the US and Texas.<p>

The assistance to Mexico will include the use of tanker planes and helicopters and other equipment to fight the fires, plus participation in a reforestation program and training after the fires are out.<p>

In a sardonic moment Friday, popular Mexico City radio commentator quipped that whereas Americans are accustomed to Mexico sending its people north, "now we're sending smoke 'Made in Mexico.'"<p>

Mexican officials acknowledge they lack the resources for a full assault on the fires.  Already 50 firefighters have died in the blazes, most of them wearing only T-shirts and jeans and equipped with little more than shovels or blankets to smother the fires.  But officials also cite social and cultural conditions that make stopping the fires complex.<p>

Around Mexico City, fires have been set inside ecological reserves by squatters taking advantage of the weather to clear land for illegal dwellings.  Officials insist that no change in the reserves' protected status will be tolerated.<p>

Then there are the thousands of subsistence farmers who are following their annual custom in setting the fires.  Only on Friday did officials begin asking farmers in some states to suspend burning.<p>

On a recent trip to the Yucatan Peninsula, this reporter saw dozens of fires burning.  And every day, poor local farmers armed with machetes and cans of kerosene could be seen ambling along - doing what they do every burning season.<p>

<h3>Mexico: 7 Young Men Killed In Shootout At Marijuana Field In Mexico</h3><p>

MEXICO CITY - Seven young men were killed in a shootout at a marijuana field in northern Mexico on Wednesday, and authorities said the traffickers removed the drugs before police arrived on the scene.<p>

The shootout occurred in a mountain marijuana plantation in Higueras de Abuya, 55 miles south of the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan, a prime drug-smuggling region, said Marcelo Arellano, a spokesman for the state attorney general.<p>

He said the fields had been harvested recently, and the drugs had been moved into a drying facility at the plantation.  But shortly after the shootout the traffickers apparently removed the drugs, Arellano said in a telephone interview.<p>

"Only residues were left," he said.<p>

Arellano said the shootout occurred in the early hours of Wednesday, and passers-by spotted the bodies in the morning and called police.<p>

The bodies were of young men between the ages of 17 and 25, including two pairs of brothers, he said.  Each had suffered several bullet wounds from Kalashnikov rifles.<p>

<h3>Mexico's leaders call for drug legalization</h3><p> 
Mexico City - within a span of two weeks, three of Mexico's most important leaders, including President Vicente Fox, have called for the possibility of legalizing drugs to end the Drug War.<p>

On March 15, Mexico's Federal Police Chief told a reporter that legalization "seems like the only possible solution, although it is utopian, to combat narco-trafficking."<p>

Two days later, when questioned about Chief's comments, President Fox noted that "humanity will some day view it [legalization] as the best solution to the problem". Then, on March 27, Chihuahua state Governer told the El Universal newspaper that he was in agreement with the sentiment to legalize drugs as a solution to the drug problem.<p>

<h3>Drug seizures do not deterrent mexican drug smugglers.</h3><p>
<hr>
<img src = "seizures.JPG"><p>
Drugs confiscated at the United States-Mexico border, in pounds.<p>
<hr>

San Diego, California<p>
America's war on terrorism does not deter mexican drug smugglers, as weary mexican smugglers avoid the risk of shipping their contraband across the border.<p>

Under tight security with many more vehicle searches, the amount of drugs seized fell 80 percent along the 1,962-mile United States-Mexico border in the two weeks after the terrorists attacks, compared with the same period a year ago, a dismal failure for customs agents, who are no longer seizing contraband destined to enter the United States through other routes.<p>

"The drug dealers, they're not stupid. They realize it would be risky to ship their stuff right now," said a spokesman for the United States Customs Service in Washington.<p> 

No one is suggesting drugs have become scarce in the United States. But authorities have long known that smugglers post spotters near border points to gauge security. Authorities expect the flow to surge again when the traffickers spot an opportunity, said a Customs official who analysed seizure records along the border.<p>

"The traffickers in Mexico don't want to sit on their product too long.", "They've got to get it to market and pay their people."<p>

"Marijuana smugglers may not be able to wait much longer. The end of September marks their harvest season in Mexico, and the dealers will be eager to move old supplies out of storage to make room for the fresh crop", said a Drug Enforcement Administration official in Pheonix.<p>

"It's getting moldy", DEA official said of the older crop. "They're desperately going to want to get rif of it."<p>

But the temporary drop after the attacks was significant, officials said. However, the contraband still remains ready to be smuggled, the contraband is still quantified and intact.<p>

Inspectors at California's border crossings, seized 4,179 pounds of Marijuana, Cocaine, Heroin, and other drugs. That was an 86 percent decline from the same 13-day period last year. Which means that there is over 25,066 pounds of drug contraband still waiting on the other side of the California-Mexico border, and another 9,009 pounds on the Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas-Mexico border, and another 1,378 pounds on the South Texas-Mexico border, and another 35,453 pounds as the total contraband waiting to be smuggled into the United States by any desperate means necessary.<p>

Mexican drug smugglers can avoid the ports of entry altogether and try to get their goods into the United States by alternate routes, by boat, or overland through the desert wilderness between the border crossings.<p> 

However, these methods also present challenges. The Coast Guard has been searching all foreign vessels entering certain United States ports, including San Diego, and Customs surveillance planes have been patrolling the Southwest border.<p>  

If the heavy security remains in force, officials believe the contraband smugglers will begin taking extreme risks, including murdering Customs Agents, DEA agents, and United States police officers. "Eventually they are going to try to get it across somehow," said Customs official.<p>

<h3>Drug smugglers tunnelling proves successful</h3><p>
Tecate, Mexico<p>
It was a typical bedroom with long curtains and a plush, floral rug, except that the fireplace was not just for keeping things cozy.<p>

When mexican border police removed the metal grill still holding charred logs, they found a secret tunnel to the United States.<p>

Over the past decade, officials have discovered at least 16 tunnels along the 2,000 mile open United States-Mexico border, all thought to be used for smuggling drugs. Six have been found since December, and federal law enforcement officials on both sides of the border believe five of them started operating after the September 11th terrorist attacks. This suggests to them that heightened United States border security is driving more smugglers to the underground route which is safer and more profitable.<p>

"We firmly believe there is a direct relation to our fortification of the border," said associate special agent in charge of the United States Customs Service in Tucson, Arizona.<p>

The passage behind the fireplace was discovered in February in an isolated ranch house twenty miles east of the Mexican border town of Tecate. It had rails on which smugglers would send tons of Cocaine and Marijuana on electric carts on a three-hundred yard journey into the back of a staircase of a house in Tierra del Sol, California, without alot of work.<p>

While it is believed to have gone undetected for ten years, the other recently discovered tunnels seem newer and more hastily dug.<p>

One was still under construction when United States Border Patrol Agents stumbled upon it last month. Another, found in March, was built to bypass the entrance of another tunnel that had already been discovered and sealed with concrete.<p>

The sealed tunnel, found in December, ran eighty-five feet from a Nogales home in Arizona to a concrete drainage canal in Mexico, where smugglers covered the opening with a steel utility plate and resealed it with cement each time they used it.<p>

United States Customs authorities believe it had only been operating for three months, in which time smugglers moved over US$20 MILLION dollars worth of Cocaine and Marijuana.<p>

Another tunnel believed put into operation since September 11th and found last month ended in a parking lot near the United States Customes Office in Nogales, nearly literally under the feet of United States Customs Officers, DEA, and Federal Agents.<p>

Authorities on both sides of the border are looking for more, but it is a nearly impossible challenge.<p>

"We can't go around doing seismic graphs, and we can't check without a search warrant," said a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman in San Diego.<p>

If these tunnels represent less than 5% of the total tunnels on the United States-Mexico border then this means that there are at least 320 tunnels in active operation with one tunnel being completed every 1.8 months and accellerating with tunnel discoveries by border patrol agents on both sides at a rate of 1.6 tunnels per year, with an average of at least 6.25 border miles per tunnel, with Texas providing most of the tunnelage.<p>

This means that it will take border agents at least 200 years to discover all of the tunnels currently operating today with drug smugging tunnel estimates reaching over US$25.7 BILLION dollars annually and increasing.<p>

<h3>Mexico...Mexicali</h3><p>
Major drug drafficker arrested in Mexico<p>
Mexico City<p>
A drug trafficker who allegedly bribed a governor and admitted to shipping at least a ton of Cocaine in the United States per month has been captured, officials said.<p>

Troops surrounded and seized the mexican drug baron and six alleged accomplices early sunday in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz, Mexico's Defense Secretary told a news conference.<p>

Among those arrested with him was a federal police agent.<p>

The drug baron "was not as famous, did not have the glamor, if we can call it that, of others, but he is and was very important in handling Cocaine", said Defense Secretary.<p>

"When he was captured, he himself spoke of moving about a ton, a ton and a half of Cocaine every month".<p>

Mexico's Attorney General de la Concha, who accompanied the Secretary during the news conference, said the drug baron also admitted to working with Mexico's former Quintana Roo State Govenor.<p>

The street value of this drug barons export here in the United States is worth over US$90 MILLION to US$135.63 MILLION dollars per month.<p>

<h3>Tijuana...Mexicali</h3><p>
Mexico City<p>
Mexican Federales arrested forty-one police officers in Baja California, Including DEA-trained Tijuana police chief and former Mexicali police chief. The arrests, at the Tecate police academy, were part of the crackdown on the Tijuana cartel, in which the kingpin was arrested March 9 and his brother was killed by police Febuary 10th.<p>

<h3>California...Cannabis</h3><p>
SACRAMENTO, California<p>
Growing marijuana in California isn't what it used to be.<p>

Mexican drug cartels, attracted by the state's rich soil and remote forests, grew nearly three-quarters of the pot seized in California this fall, state officials announced Tuesday.<p>

That marks a dangerous shift toward large and sophisticated growing operations, said Commander of the Justice Department's Campaign Against Marijuana Production, known as CAMP.<p>

"It used to be an industry controlled by hippies with small gardens," Commander said. "Now, it's not uncommon to see cartels planting anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 plants in a garden."<p>

This year, local, state police and federal drug DEA agents confiscated a record 354,000 of Marijuana plants worth about US$1.4 BILLION dollars, California State Attorney General said Tuesday.<p>

State officials say higher prices -- as much as $4,000 a pound -- make Marijuana cultivation a fast-growing industry.<p>

Since the CAMP program started nearly 20 years ago, more than 3 MILLION Cannabis sativa plants have been seized -- nearly half of which were confiscated in just the last four years.<p>

About 74 percent of Marijuana farms raided this year had apparent ties to Mexican Drug Cartels, which sometimes find it is easier to grow Marijuana in the states rather than risk smuggling it across the border.<p>

The increase in the amount of Marijuana gardens in California comes as states across the country push for less severe penalties for growing and carrying marijuana. Seven states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. And Nevada voters will consider a ballot initiative next week to legalize small amounts of Marijuana.<p>

Of the 181 gardens raided, the average garden had 2,000 plants and eight had 10,000 or more plants.<p>

Most frequently, armed immigrants tend to guard farms hidden in remote areas of state and national forests and other public land, said assistant special agent at the Bureau of Land Management.<p>

More than half of all the Marijuana seized was grown on public land, where armed growers can pose a danger to unsuspecting hikers and hunters, he said.<p>
<hr>
<h3>Cannabis...California</h3><p>
Guerrilla Growers Invade National Parks<p>
Los Angeles<p>
Authorities at Sequoia National Park report a 600% increase in the amount of marijuana grown in the park this year, attributing it to tighter security at the United States-Mexico border after Septmber 11th, 2001. "The level of cultivation is far greater than anything we've ever seen before," a spokeswoman said.<p>

In one week in late September, park rangers uncovered eight metric tons of marijuana from eight interconnecting gardens. Park superintendent claimed: "Visitors have inadvertently come upon growers...and have had weapons pointed at them."<p>

<h3>Chopper Crash</h3><p>
On March 10, two federal police helicopters on an anti-drug mission in the mountains of conflicted Guerrero State were shot out of the sky by AK-47 fire near Xitopontia in Ahuacotzingo municipality, killing seven people on board. Authorities blame narco gangs. Peasants in Xitopontia told the local Human Rights Center of La Montana that their community was invaded afterwards by army troops who forcibly entered and ransacked their homes in brutal 'searches'.<p>

Three days later, another federal chopper, also on a fumigation mission to destroy Marijuana and Opium crops, crashed near the coastal town of Zihuatanejo, killing the pilot, but this time, authorities blamed engine trouble. Guerrero, home to several drug gangs and guerrilla factions, has seen over a third of the 159 attacks on federal police helicopters reported in Mexico since 1997.<p>

<h3>Matamores Mexico</h3><p>
Following a 45-minute gun battle between Mexican army troops and federal police and some 300 hired gunmen of accused Gulf cartel boss Osiel Cardenas-Guillen in the border city of Matamoros, the notorious kingpin was taken into custody. Three soldiers were wounded in the shootout.<p>

<h3>Mafia...Mexico</h3><p>

MEXICO CITY -- Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.<p>

Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.<p>

Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders.<p>

"With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."<p>

Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.<p>

Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.<p>

Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.<p>

No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade -- or Zambada's sizable share of it -- are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.<p>

Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.<p>

Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.<p>

Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.<p>

Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.<p>

The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.<p>

Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.<p>

But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates.<p>

"There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more."<p>

"They sought out El Mayo," he explained.<p>

Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.<p>

Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana. Rather than challenge the rival gang's authority between Baja California and California, Zambada has tightened his control of smuggling routes leading from neighboring Sonora state into Arizona, authorities say.<p>

Chavez said his office is stationing more DEA agents and informants in Sonora and southernmost Arizona in an effort to further target Zambada's group. The DEA also has received special funding for highway billboards between Tucson and Phoenix featuring a wanted poster of Zambada.<p>

Zambada remains a bitter enemy of the Arellano Felix gang, but is close to accused Juarez cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and has reached out to Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a convicted drug lord who escaped from prison and specializes in building drug tunnels under the U.S. border, authorities say.<p>

"El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together," Chavez said. "He and El Chapo are very close. They have helped each other become very successful in Arizona."<p>

Originally from Sinaloa state where Mazatlan is located, Zambada got his start as an enforcer and hit man for the Juarez cartel based in the border city of the same name.<p>

Investigators can't agree on when he founded his own group of freelance smugglers. Mexico's attorney general's office still listed him as one of the heads of Juarez cartel's operations in Sinaloa as recently as 1998, but Chavez and other DEA officials said Zambada began working to form his own group in Mazatlan more than a decade ago.<p>

Mexico has taken out several top drug lords over the past two years. Besides the Arellano Felix brothers, police and soldiers collared Osiel Cardenas, the alleged head of the gulf cartel, in March. Last month, they caught up with Armando Valencia, one of the alleged heads of a drug gang based in the central state of Michoacan.<p>

Chavez said the DEA is watching family members Zambada has in the United States, but there's no evidence he has crossed the border. In August, Mexican special agents stormed homes in Sonora state's capital, Hermosillo, arresting one Zambada associate.<p>

Chavez said authorities were "one step away from El Chapo and two steps away from El Mayo."<p>

"It came down to timing," he said. "Our timing wasn't right."<p>

<h3>Contraband Conspiracy</h3><p>

After finding about 700 pounds of marijuana inside a semitrailer on Interstate 70 and arresting two people, authorities sent the driver to Denver to deliver the pot and arrested six more, police said.<p>

The discovery of the drugs, with a street value of US$2.25 MILLION, was made about 11 a.m. Tuesday, when the trailer was stopped for a commercial vehicle safety inspection by the Utah Highway Patrol's Commercial Vehicle Safety Bureau, just south of Richfield on Interstate 70, said Utah Highway Patrol Sargeant.<p>

But the paperwork offered by the truck's driver and his partner was suspicious, he said. "Their log books didn't match" Sargeant said. "There were a lot of discrepancies that didn't add up."<p>

The trooper asked for and received permission to search the trailer, authorities said, and found the marijuana inside.<p>

The driver and passenger, both men from California, were arrested, Sargeant said. Their ages were not available Wednesday, but they appeared to be in their 40s, he said.<p>

Authorities set up delivery Wednesday, using the men to deliver the drugs to Denver as if nothing had happened, he said. Six more people who showed up to claim the marijuana were also arrested.<p>

The team was on its way back to Utah after the arrests Wednesday afternoon, Sargeant said.<p>

The six arrested in Denver were to stay in Colorado and face prosecution there, either from state authorities or the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, he said.<p>

<h3>Gringo Ganja</h3><p>

MEXICO CITY -- Mexican federal agents in the border state of Sonora discovered about 12 tons of marijuana stuffed into nearly 4,000 plastic packets and hidden inside a tanker truck hauling vegetable oil, authorities said Friday.<p>

Police stopped the big rig at a routine highway checkpoint and discovered that each of its metal tanks had been hollowed out to carry packets of marijuana under its legitimate payload of vegetable oil, the federal attorney general's office said.<p>

Police and federal agents removed 3,818 plastic packets of marijuana from the tanks and arrested the vehicle's driver, Miguel Angel Parra.<p>

The suspect told authorities he was instructed to drive the truck from the western city of Guadalajara to Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, California.<p>

12 tons of marijuana has an estimated street value of US$77.142 MILLION.<p>

<h3>Highway High</h3><p>
285 pounds of marijuana found in traffic stop, police say<p>
   
The Utah Highway Patrol arrested a 28-year-old man after discovering 285 pounds of marijuana in the pickup he was driving, authorities said. The stop occurred about 10 a.m. Saturday near Nephi. Utah Highway Patrol Trooper stopped the pickup for a broken taillight, said UHP spokeswoman. The man consented to a search, and Utah Highway Patrol Trooper found the marijuana in the back of the truck, the UHP said. Records at the Salt Lake County Jail, where he was booked, list him as being from Stockton, California.<p>

285 pounds of marijuana has an estimated street value of US$.916 MILLION<p>

<h3>Mafia Mexico</h3><p>

 Nuevo Laredo, Mexico -- Four trucks pulled up outside the Casa Hogar Elim orphanage on Children's Day, one of Mexico's most popular holidays. Guadalupe Carmona de Gonzalez, who runs the children's home, said men unloaded thousands of dollars worth of chicken, rice and milk, and boxes of new dolls and toys.<p>

    They also brought four big sheet cakes decorated with Winnie the Pooh and the Little Mermaid and a note drawn in icing: "For the children at Casa Hogar, from your friend Osiel Cardenas Guillen."<p>

    Carmona said the children squealed in delight. But authorities in Mexico and the United States expressed dismay at the thought of Cardenas, one of Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers, ordering shipments of goodies from his cell in Mexico's main maximum-security prison.<p>

    In at least three other places along the U.S.-Mexico border on Children's Day, April 30, children received truckloads of bicycles, dolls and other toys from Cardenas, who has been incarcerated since his arrest last year in a shootout between his bodyguards and Mexican soldiers. Cardenas, 37, a former police officer, also sent thousands of dollars for relief supplies to the border city of Piedras Negras in April after floods there killed more than 30 people.<p>

    Officials said Mexican drug dealers have long been silent benefactors, building roads and churches and passing out cash or drugs to win support -- or silence -- in the communities where they work. But officials said Cardenas' public donations appear to be the first of their kind.
    "Those toys represent the suffering of many people, the destruction of many families," said Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, Mexico's top organized crime prosecutor.<p>

    Officials in Mexico and the United States say that grass-roots support is a key reason the Mexican cartels continue to operate, despite what U.S. officials call a "golden era" of cooperation between law enforcement agencies in the two countries and a series of high-profile arrests.
    Larry Holifield, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Mexico and Central American office, called Mexican trafficking groups "the most powerful in the world" in a recent speech in Panama and estimated their trade at US$65 BILLION a YEAR.<p>

    In interviews in three cities on the 225-mile stretch of the border closest to the Gulf of Mexico, the home territory of Cardenas' Gulf Cartel, local officials and citizens said drug traffickers continued to overwhelm law enforcement. Since January 2003, there have been 108 drug-related deaths in this area, from Nuevo Laredo to Matamoros, the Gulf Coast city south of Brownsville, Texas. The vast majority of the killings are unsolved, according to the Center for Border Studies and Human Rights in Reynosa.<p>

    "We're never going to be as powerful as they are," said Ronaldo Rivas Carrillo, municipal police chief in Valle Hermoso, a city of 60,000 people just south of Matamoros, which also received a truckload of toys from Cardenas.<p>

    Rivas said Cardenas' power comes not just from the cartel's superior weapons and collusion with corrupt police and officials, but also from his campaign to win hearts and minds among the poor.<p>

    Much of the cartel's support comes from young people, who see the cartels as exciting, rich and a ticket out of poverty, Rivas added.
    Rivas and other officials said cartels received help from locals, such as shoeshine boys or taxi drivers, who accepted money or drugs in exchange for informing the traffickers about police or army activity. They said others looked the other way, whether out of gratitude or fear.<p>

    In Reynosa, residents said a man who left no name or telephone number paid $1,000 in cash to rent a private hall for a Children's Day party. Private buses then took 300 poor children to the hall, where four trucks with no license plates arrived filled with expensive toys.<p>

    Law enforcement officials said Cardenas might also be trying to build sympathy as the court considers trafficking charges against him.
    "Individuals like Osiel Cardenas want to be seen as Robin Hood," said Michael Vigil, who was head of the DEA's San Diego office until his retirement in May. "That's the way they play it; they manipulate public sentiment."<p>

    Raymundo Ramos, head of a human rights organization in Nuevo Laredo, said he thought Cardenas was trying to create the kind of popular following that the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar cultivated in his home city of Medellin, where he built hundreds of homes for the poor. Ramos said Cardenas wanted the poor to see him as more generous than a government that has done little to improve education, health and other basic services.
    On the morning of Children's Day, cars with loudspeakers trawled the poor neighborhoods of Valle Hermoso, playing a recording inviting children to a big party with free gifts at the Spanish Casino, a private hall near the center of downtown.<p>

    Francisca Montalvo Gomez, 39, heard the cars as they passed on the dirt road in front of her tiny wooden house. Two of her daughters, Jaley and Vanessa, ran over to the hall and found hundreds of children already lined up. The girls said they waited in line for about 30 minutes, and each received a doll from the clowns who were passing out gifts, juice and candy. Standing in their front yard three weeks later, they still giggled as one of their gifts, a baby doll, answered its little cell phone and sang a well-known pop song.<p>

    Montalvo said she had not known who was handing out the gifts, figuring it was probably the local government or a church group, until the local press revealed the next day that it was Cardenas. "Maybe he regrets his crimes," she said. "He must be a good person if he's doing things to help poor people."<p>

    Around the corner, Karen Lopez played with a large "Magnum Fighters" robot she received at the party, after spending two hours in line with her mother, Abigail Lopez. She stored the robot carefully in its box; her mother said it probably cost nearly $20, and that Karen, 4, had never had such an expensive toy. She took out her robot and laughed in delight as it walked across a tabletop, buzzing and flashing its lights.<p>

    Sergio Torres Martinez, a local official in Valle Hermoso, said the municipal government could not compete with Cardenas, whose organization is believed to run several BILLION DOLLARS worth of cocaine into Texas every year. Torres said the local government had thrown parties for children but could not afford expensive presents. "It's discouraging when a private citizen, a criminal, can make the work of city hall look so small," he said.<p>

    Torres said the government tried to counter the drug traffickers' heroic image among young people by teaching a class in elementary schools, stressing the values of family life and good citizenship and the dangers of drugs. He said the city had put as much money as it could into youth sports programs. "Since we can't fight the narcos directly, we have to fight other ways," he said.<p>

The minimum lethal dose of heroin is 200 mg, although people who have developed tolerance can survive doses several times higher than this.<p>

In the case of morphine, single doses of more than 30 mg (intravenously) or 40-100 mg (orally) are toxic to those without tolerance. The minimum lethal dose is reported to be 120 mg for morphine and 800 mg for codeine.<p>

The amounts of morphine or heroin needed to kill a nonaddict have been variously estimated at 120 milligrams (oral), 200 milligrams, 250 milligrams, and 350 milligrams<p>

though it has also been noted that nonaddicts have survived much larger doses.<p>

Syndrome X:
Alcohol-Barbiturate-Heroine hypothesis: If Heroin (100mg) is taken intravenously with alcohol and/or barbiturate or cocaine, the result will be coma/death.<p>

If this alcohol-heroin and barbiturate-heroin and cocaine-heroin explanation is correct, the fact is of the utmost practical importance-for hundreds of deaths a year might be prevented by <b>warning addicts not to shoot heroin
 while drunk on alcohol, cocaine or barbiturates.</b><p>
