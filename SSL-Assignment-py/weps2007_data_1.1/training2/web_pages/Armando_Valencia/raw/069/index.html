      <p><b>White House Names Drug 10 &quot;Kingpins&quot; for Sanctions, June 1, 2004</b></p>
      <p>(Drug traffickers to be denied access to U.S. financial system)</p>
      <p>The Bush administration designated 10 international drug traffickers June 1 as narcotics kingpins.
      This designation directs U.S. government agencies to deny those named, their businesses and their
      operatives access to the U.S financial system.</p>
      <p>The president names the drug traffickers for these sanctions under the authority granted to him by
      the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act which has required the annual designation since 2000.</p>
      <p>Following is a White House fact sheet on the kingpin act.<br>

      <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<br>
      Office of the Press Secretary<br>
      June 1, 2004</p>
      <p>FACT SHEET: Overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act</p>
      <p>Introduction</p>
      <p>The Administration has released the names of 10 drug traffickers and entities against whom the
      President decided to impose sanctions pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21
      U.S.C. 1901-1908, 8 U.S.C. 1182). The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the &quot;Kingpin
      Act&quot;) targets, on a worldwide basis, significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their
      organizations, and operatives.</p>
      <p>Background</p>
      <p>The purpose of the Kingpin Act is to deny significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their related
      businesses, and their operatives access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions
      involving U.S. companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act authorizes the President to take these actions
      when he determines that a foreign narcotics trafficker presents a threat to the national security,
      foreign policy, or economy of the United States. Congress modeled the Kingpin Act after the effective
      sanctions program that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;)
      administers against the Colombian drug cartels pursuant to Executive Order 12978 issued in October 1995
      under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (&quot;IEEPA&quot;).</p>
      <p>Implementation</p>
      <p>The Kingpin Act requires that the Departments of Treasury, Justice, State, and Defense, and the
      Central Intelligence Agency, coordinate on the identification of proposed kingpins for designation by
      the President. Although not required by statute, the Department of Homeland Security also is included in
      the process. By June 1 each year, the Act calls for the President to report to specified congressional
      committees those &quot;foreign persons [he] determines are appropriate for sanctions&quot; and stating
      his intent to impose sanctions upon those foreign persons pursuant to the Act. While this is a recurring
      annual requirement, the President may designate significant foreign narcotics traffickers at any time.</p>
      <p>Under the Kingpin Act, the President may designate foreign entities as well as foreign individuals as
      kingpins. A foreign person is defined as &quot;any citizen or national of a foreign state or any entity
      not organized under the laws of the United States, but does not include a foreign state.&quot; Likewise,
      the President is not required to designate Colombian persons exclusively under Executive Order 12978,
      issued in October 1995 under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (&quot;IEEPA&quot;),
      and may designate a Colombian individual or entity under the Kingpin Act, which is intended to be global
      in scope.</p>
      <p>The long-term effectiveness of the Kingpin Act is enhanced by the Department of the Treasury's
      authority (in consultation with appropriate government agencies and departments) to make derivative
      designations of foreign individuals and entities providing specified types of support or assistance to
      designated traffickers. This authority broadens the scope of application of the economic sanctions
      against designated kingpins to include their businesses and operatives. To date, the President has
      announced 48 Kingpins and the Department of the Treasury has announced a total of 66 derivative
      designations, 14 entities and 52 individuals, pursuant to section 805(b) of the Kingpin Act. These
      entities and individuals are subject to the same sanctions that apply to kingpins. In addition,
      designated individuals and immediate family members who have knowingly benefited from the designated
      individuals' illicit activity will be denied visas to the United States under 8 U.S.C. section
      1182(a)(2)(C).</p>
      <p>The Kingpin Act provides for criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for individuals and up
      to a $10 million fine for entities for violations, as well as a maximum of 30 years imprisonment and/or
      a $5 million fine for officers, directors or agents of entities who knowingly participate in violations.
      The Kingpin Act also provides for civil penalties of up to $1 million.</p>
      <p>Designations</p>

      Kingpin Act are:</p>
