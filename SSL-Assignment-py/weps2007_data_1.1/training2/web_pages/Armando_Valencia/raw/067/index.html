                                    <p>US and EU negotiators have agreed on a 
                                      general framework within which to negotiate 
                                      to reduce agricultural trade subsidies. 
                                      In the absence of specific proposals, it 
                                      has not been viewed as sufficient to move 
                                      forward World Trade Organization talks scheduled 
                                      for September. India has rejected the framework. 
                                      Benin, Botswana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, 
                                      Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, 
                                      Zambia and Zimbabwe have issued a joint 
                                      statement saying they are not prepared to 
                                      start negotiation with WTO in September, 
                                      pointing to the implications on WTO proposals 
                                      on developing countries. </p>
                                    <p>Talks regarding North Korea's nuclear programs 
                                      will be held in China August 27-19. North 
                                      Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan 
                                      and the US will participate. Russia, China 
                                      and South Korea are all considering potential 
                                      security and trade arrangements to help 
                                      ease tensions. </p>
                                    <p>Iraqi oil exports through the pipeline 
                                      to Turkey had scarcely begun when a fire 
                                      stopped production. It will take weeks to 
                                      repair. Damage to this critical industry 
                                      sector hurts revenues and raises the cost 
                                      of occupation. This was not the only likely 
                                      incident of sabotage -- a damaged water 
                                      main was only one of the more serious among 
                                      escalating incidents. Meanwhile, the death 
                                      toll continues to rise, including attacks 
                                      against the police. Responsibility for the 
                                      myriad attacks is wide-ranging, including 
                                      loyalists of the ousted regime, nationalists 
                                      and Islamists, friends and families of civilians 
                                      hurt or killed by the occupying powers, 
                                      and foreign terrorists.</p>
                                    <p>An international sting operation brought 
                                      together the US, UK and Russia. The sting 
                                      was an operation represented as Islamic 
                                      militants targeting a US aircraft, to convince 
                                      a British arms dealer to sell an anti-aircraft 
                                      missile to be used in the attack. Intelligence 
                                      organizations in the three countries cooperated 
                                      to trap Hemant Lakhani and two alleged accomplices.</p>

                                    <p>Algerian kidnappers holding 14 European 
                                      hostages in Mali have agreed to let the 
                                      local Tuareg negotiator take food and medicine 
                                      to the hostages. A resolution to the situation 
                                      seems imminent. </p>
                                    <p>Benin and Nigeria have agreed to reopen 
                                      the border that had been unilaterally closed 
                                      by Nigeria to combat cross-border crimes.</p>
                                    <p>In Democratic Republic of Congo, fighting 
                                      between Mayi-Mayi militias and CD rebels 
                                      continues as do discussions of militia disarmament. 
                                      Bangladeshi peacekeeping troops have begun 
                                      to join the UN mission.</p>
                                    <p>Ivory Coast continues to make progress 
                                      towards peace and security. 54 political 
                                      prisoners have been released under an amnesty. 
                                      But unofficial armed groups continue to 
                                      threaten the peace process.</p>
                                    <p>Kenyan police in Mombasa recovered explosives 
                                      and military training manuals in a house 
                                      linked to the November car bomb that blew 
                                      up a hotel.</p>
                                    <p>Liberian President Charles Taylor handed 
                                      over power to his Vice President, Moses 
                                      Blah, who has been sworn in and attended 
                                      initial peace discussions in Ghana. Taylor 
                                      has accepted asylum in Nigeria. The port 
                                      of Monrovia has been handed over to peacekeepers 
                                      and humanitarian aid is slowly resuming. 
                                      The security situation remains unstable, 
                                      with only 800 Nigerian soldiers in place, 
                                      and 200 US marines patrolling in the vicinity. 
                                      The West African peacekeeping force will 
                                      eventually increase to over 3,000, but there 
                                      have been repeated calls for more than 5,000, 
                                      including a significant US presence.</p>
                                    <p>Libya has accepted responsibility for the 
                                      1988 Lockerbie bombing and is expected to 
                                      pay $2.7 billion into a UN-managed fund 
                                      for the families of the victims. These measures 
                                      open the way for lifting of UN sanctions

                                      The future of the transitional government 
                                      is uncertain, as the President says his 
                                      government will remain in power until an 
                                      alternative is in place, while the Prime 
                                      Minister says the transitional mandate expired, 
                                      making the President's government illegitimate. 
                                      Meanwhile, armed groups have exchanged fire, 
                                      and there have been a number of fatal criminal

                                      by police using tear gas and batons. Mswati 
                                      dismissed the concerns.</p>

                                      Argentina's congress has voted to annul 
                                      laws providing amnesty for former members 
                                      of the military dictatorship of 1976-1983, 
                                      opening the way for prosecutions of human 
                                      rights abuses during the &quot;Dirty War&quot;.</p>
                                    <p>Chile's main trade union federation, the 
                                      600,000 member Central Workers Unit (CUT), 
                                      went on strike for improved working conditions 
                                      and benefits. It was the first national 
                                      strike since the end of military rule, almost 
                                      20 years ago. Police used tear gas and water 
                                      canon to disperse demonstrators, broke up 
                                      a 3,000 person march, intervened in a riot 
                                      and arrested 130 people.</p>
                                    <p>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, after 
                                      meeting with US military officials reviewing 
                                      the effects of US military aid, has increased 
                                      pressure on the army to perform better in 
                                      their fight against left-wing rebels. The 
                                      largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed 
                                      Forces of Colombia (FARC) has undertaken 
                                      a series of deadly car bombings. In these 
                                      and armed clashes, more than a dozen people 
                                      were killed last week, including three FARC 
                                      guerillas and seven United Self-Defense 
                                      Forces (AUC) paramilitaries.</p>
                                    <p>Mexico's Zapatista rebels have created 
                                      30 new town councils to govern areas of 
                                      Chiapas in their control. With these in 
                                      place, they will withdraw from roadblocks 
                                      and stop charging fees for travel through 
                                      the region. The Mexican government has said 
                                      that it would respect the local councils 
                                      and that peace talks could be restarted.</p>
                                    <p>Paraguay's President Luis Gonzalez Macchi 
                                      has handed over power to his successor, 
                                      Nicanor Duarte. Macchi has been prohibited 
                                      from leaving the country; he faces charges 
                                      of embezzlement.</p>
                                    <p>When the power went out in New York City 
                                      and large parts of the northeast and midwest, 
                                      the first question answered was that there 
                                      was no evidence of terrorist involvement. 
                                      The cause of the blackout, affecting some 
                                      50 million people, has not yet been determined, 
                                      but has raised questions about the stability 
                                      and security of this sector of the critical 
                                      infrastructure. Telecommunications including 
                                      the internet were virtually unaffected by 
                                      the outage.</p>
                                    <p>The American Bar Association has called 
                                      for the US Congress and White House to ensure

                                      access to civilian attorneys. To date, minimal 
                                      changes have been made in the rules of the 
                                      military tribunals, which currently provide 
                                      for a military officer to act for the defense 
                                      and grant no confidentiality. Discussions

                                      a travel ban, they could face penalties 
                                      of up to 12 years in jail and $1 million

                                      concern that Australian proposals for regional 
                                      efforts to combat money laundering, terrorism, 
                                      poverty and so on could compromise sovereignty

                                    <p>Iran may put some al Qaeda suspects on 
                                      trial but has no intention of allowing the 
                                      US to interrogate those it has in custody, 
                                      although it may repatriate Saudis. Government 
                                      attempts to remove legal and social inequalities 
                                      against women have been rejected by the 
                                      hardline Guardian Council. The Iranian government 
                                      is proceeding to the second development 
                                      phase of its nuclear power plant and is

                                    <p>Violent incidents in Israel and the occupied 
                                      territories continue to put the roadmap 
                                      peace process at risk. There were two Palestinian 
                                      suicide attacks: in Israel, the al Aqsa 
                                      Martyrs Brigade bomber killed himself and 
                                      one other, injuring ten. Outside a Jewish 
                                      settlement in the West Bank, the Hamas-affiliated 
                                      bomber and one Israeli were killed. Israeli 
                                      troops demolished the home of one of the 
                                      bombers and entered the West Bank city of 
                                      Hebron to search for the local leader of 
                                      Islamic Jihad's armed wing, Mohammed Seder. 
                                      Seder was killed in the attack and Islamic 
                                      Jihad has vowed revenge.</p>
                                    <p>Despite these attacks, Israel has moved 
                                      to free additional prisoners, has agreed 
                                      to turn four more West Bank cities to Palestinian 
                                      control, and will permit Yasser Arafat to 
                                      visit his sister's grave, following her 
                                      death in Gaza earlier in the week. </p>
                                    <p>Lebanon and Syria are concerned over the 
                                      escalation of tension in the Levant. In 
                                      southern Lebanon, Israeli aircraft attacked 
                                      suspected Hezbollah positions in retaliation 
                                      over shells fired to northern Israel that 
                                      killed a teenage boy. Hezbollah had reacted 
                                      to the death of a Hezbollah militant and 
                                      continued overflights by Israeli forces.

                                    <p>Saudi security forces fought a gun battle 
                                      with suspected militants, killing four policemen 
                                      and one militant. Authorities have pledged 
                                      a decisive battle against terrorism in an 
                                      operation that will include questioning

                                      Afghanistan saw its bloodiest 24-hours in 
                                      more than a year as 61 people were killed 
                                      and dozens wounded in violent attacks across 
                                      the country, including factional fighting, 
                                      battles with Taliban and al Qaeda, and a 
                                      bus bomb that killed 15 people. Attacks 
                                      against aid workers and Afghan soldiers 
                                      forced the closure of missions in Helmland 
                                      and Kandahar provinces. More forces are 
                                      required to secure Afghanistan outside of

                                    <p>NATO has now assumed control of peacekeeping

                                      outside of Europe.</p>

                                    <p>It was also a violent week in the India, 
                                      as separatist groups protested independence 
                                      day celebrations. In the state of Tripura, 
                                      the separatist rebel All Tripura Tiger Force 
                                      (ATTF) claimed responsibility for a landmine 
                                      that killed five. Another attack at the 
                                      end of the week killed 30 villagers. Assam 
                                      separatists clashed with government troops, 
                                      killing six rebels. In Manipur, a bomb on 
                                      a bridge killed six bus passengers. </p>

                                      to combat terrorism on human rights. They 
                                      called for all countries to ensure that 
                                      anti-terrorism measures complied with obligations 
                                      under international human rights laws.</p>

                                      The investigation and arrest of Hemant Lakhani 
                                      and two alleged accomplices in connection 
                                      with smuggling an anti-aircraft missile 
                                      to be used against a commercial US aircraft 
                                      has again raised fears over this threat 
                                      to aviation. Most airports use predictable 
                                      approaches that are highly susceptible to 
                                      this form of attack. A failed attempt was 
                                      seen recently in the failed attack coinciding 
                                      with the Kenyan hotel bombing.</p>
                                    <p>Taiwanese authorities, acting on a request 
                                      from the US, boarded a North Korean ship 
                                      and seized barrels of phosphorus pentasulfide. 
                                      It is an ordinary chemical used to manufacture 
                                      insecticide and as a fuel additive, but 
                                      could also potentially be used in chemical

                                      In China, construction workers came upon 
                                      five metal drums that they cut into pieces 
                                      and sold to a recycling facility. At least 
                                      36 people, including the construction workers 
                                      and others who came into contact with the 
                                      barrels, became seriously ill. The drums 
                                      had contained chemicals, probably mustard 
                                      gas that had been left by Japanese troops 
                                      after World War II. Japan has sent a medical 
                                      team to help and will also dispose of the 
                                      chemicals.</p>
                                    <p>The US Institute of Medicine has recommended 
                                      that the focus on smallpox preparedness 
                                      should move away from vaccinations (that 
                                      are dangerous relative to the small risk) 
                                      and towards improved coordination and response. 
                                      They also said a vaccination for the general 
                                      public is not recommended.</p>

                                      ARTICLE: Good Governance: Transnational 
                                      Corporations and Human Rights</span></p>
                                    <p>Poor governance is one of the major contributing 
                                      factors to the emergence of terrorism and 
                                      political violence, and the systems that 
                                      support them. Efforts to improve governance 
                                      have largely focused on political institutions, 
                                      but increasingly the role of corporations 
                                      has come to the forefront. </p>
                                    <p>In the US, the scandals surrounding the 
                                      collapse of corporate giants Enron, WorldCom 
                                      and others have led to new legislation to 
                                      attempt to forestall future such collapses 
                                      and to punish the perpetrators. The Sarbonnes-Oxley 
                                      Act is particularly focused on corporate 
                                      governance. In addition, transnational criminal 
                                      cases have begun to open the way towards 
                                      not just extradition but to cooperation 
                                      and in some cases an implicit acceptance 
                                      of the concept of universal jurisdiction 
                                      applied to multinational crimes. Argentina's 
                                      recent efforts to lift immunity of those 
                                      involved in the &quot;dirty war&quot; and 
                                      cooperate with Spanish and French authorities 
                                      is one example. Another is the case of Unicol, 
                                      in which a US court recently ruled that 
                                      a case brought against it for human rights 
                                      abuses in Burma would move forward.</p>
                                    <p>Around the world there are a plethora of 
                                      standards and a wealth of local laws. There 
                                      are many voluntary standards for specific 
                                      industries, including many focused on working 
                                      conditions and labor rights as well as environmental 
                                      laws. For the first time, an international 
                                      body has undertaken a review of these initiatives 
                                      around the world, and has developed a set 
                                      of norms, or best practices, that can be 
                                      used to apply universally to all international 
                                      corporations.</p>
                                    <p>The organization that has undertaken this 
                                      is the United Nations Sub-commission for 
                                      the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
                                      This expert panel is a subsidiary of the 
                                      Commission on Human Rights and was established 
                                      in 1947. Its 26 members undertake studies 
                                      related to the Universal Declaration of 
                                      Human Rights and makes recommendations for 
                                      protecting these rights.</p>
                                    <p>At their 55th session, meeting last week, 
                                      the Sub-commission unanimously approved 
                                      the &quot;Norms on the Responsibilities 
                                      of Transnational Corporations and Other 
                                      Business Enterprises with Regard to Human 
                                      Rights (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/L.8)&quot; and 
                                      will transmit them to the Commission on 
                                      Human Rights for its consideration and adoption. 
                                      Only after adoption by the full commission 
                                      will the new rules begin to apply.</p>
                                    <p>The guidelines describe these general obligations:<br>
                                      &quot;States have the primary responsibility 
                                      to promote, secure the fulfilment of, respect, 
                                      ensure respect of, and protect human rights 
                                      recognized in international as well as national 
                                      law, including assuring that transnational 
                                      corporations and other business enterprises 
                                      respect human rights. Within their respective 
                                      spheres of activity and influence, transnational 
                                      corporations and other business enterprises 
                                      have the obligation to promote, secure the 
                                      fulfilment of, respect, ensure respect of, 
                                      and protect human rights recognized in international 
                                      as well as national law&quot;. </p>
                                    <p>And then proceeds to describe these rights 
                                      and obligations:<br>
                                      * Right to Equal Opportunity and Non-Discriminatory 
                                      Treatment<br>
                                      * Right to Security of Persons<br>
                                      * Rights of Workers<br>
                                      * Respect for National Sovereignty and Human 
                                      Rights<br>
                                      * Obligations with regard to Consumer Protection<br>
                                      * Obligations with regard to Environmental 
                                      Protection</p>
                                    <p>It then describes how to implement the 
                                      Norms, in a fashion similar to that previously 
                                      used only by nation states whereby the corporation 
                                      would &quot;adopt, disseminate, and implement 
                                      internal rules of operation&quot;, report 
                                      on their progress, and periodically be subject 
                                      to monitoring and verification by the UN. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Although moving away from voluntary industry 
                                      initiatives and clearly meant to be binding 
                                      on the corporations, it is not clear what 
                                      force of law the Norms would have, although 
                                      they do provide guidance for more binding 
                                      steps in the future. Despite this lack of 
                                      force, the recommendations will provide 
                                      more support to those companies already 
                                      complying with global standards and will 
                                      put more pressure on those that do not. 
                                      For those companies sitting on the fence, 
                                      fearing compliance could be a competitive 
                                      disadvantage, this is likely to push them 
                                      towards adoption. They also provide a universal 
                                      norm that will help close cross-border loopholes 
                                      and support local enforcement efforts.</p>
