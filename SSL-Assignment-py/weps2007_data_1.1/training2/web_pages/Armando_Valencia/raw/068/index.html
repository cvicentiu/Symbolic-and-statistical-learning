    ISLAMABAD: The United States will reward Pakistan for its support in the war on terrorism with an elite military status despite concerns
    about nuclear proliferation, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday.<br>
    <br>
	   Powell said US President George W. Bush would soon designate Pakistan a "major non-NATO ally," a move that will significantly enhance military
    cooperation between the two countries and make it easier for Islamabad to acquire certain armaments from Washington.<br>
    <br>
    'I advised the foreign minister this morning that we will also be making a notification to our Congress that will designate Pakistan as a
    major non-NATO ally for the purposes of our future military to military
    relations,' Powell told reporters after meeting his counterpart Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri.<br>
    <br>
    Khurshid Kasuri designate the talks really fruitful, 'Pakistanis also
    against Nuclear non-proliferation because it is in our favour', said Kasuri.
    Their has been an agreement on the Pakistanis imprisoned in US and strategy
    is being formed, Kasuri informed.<br>

    </font><small><small><small><small>(Updated at 2250 PST)<br>
    </small></small></small></small><font size="2">By Allister Heath, Sunday Business, London Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News<br>
    <br>
    Mar. 14 - While the 10 accession states will enter the European Union (EU) on 1 May, it will take at least until 2007 before they are allowed to join the single currency. Unless the European Treaties are disregarded again, the accession states will have to meet numerous convergence criteria and the stability and growth pact before they are allowed to adopt the euro.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, these were not really met by many of the existing euro zone countries and are still blatantly ignored to this day by the likes of Germany, France, Belgium and Italy. But with few existing euro zone countries in any hurry to welcome new members from eastern Europe, they may well be held to a stricter interpretation of the rules.<br>
    <br>
    The deficit limit, which stipulates that the public sector deficit must not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is currently met by few countries other than the Baltic states. Countries will also have to keep government borrowing to 60 percent of GDP. The new members will be required to work towards achieving a balanced budget in the medium term after joining the EU.<br>
    <br>
    Another stipulation for membership is that inflation rates must not exceed the average for the three euro countries with the greatest price stability by more than 1.5 percent. This requirement is currently met by all accession countries except Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, though this is largely due to chance. Increasing divergence in inflation rates are likely over the next few years, making that rule especially hard to meet.<br>
    <br>
    Far less demanding is the requirement that long-term interest rates must not exceed the average for the three countries with the greatest price stability by more than two percentage points. Rates will probably converge as soon as an entry date is set.<br>
    <br>
    More importantly, none of the accession states currently meet the exchange-rate requirement because they are not members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II. This stipulates that currencies must fluctuate by no more than 15 percent around a target for two years before membership is allowed.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, all these costs will be in vain. As Ronald Stewart-Brown of the Trade Policy Research Centre argues, the whole European continent has operated as one vast free-trade zone for industrial goods since 1997; free trade, not currency unification, is the real driver of economic integration.<br>
    <br>
    Given the experience of the euro zone since 1999, the accession states should steer well clear of the single currency.<br>

    </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">(Updated at 0950 PST)</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    BAGHDAD: At least 29 people were killed and scores wounded when a powerful car bomb destroyed a hotel housing foreigners in Baghdad, just
    days ahead of the anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.<br>
    <br>
	   The attack which destroyed the hotel and devastated three nearby buildings, was the latest strike by groups the US-led coalition believes are
    trying to foment a civil war among Iraq's ethnic groups. It comes just ahead of the March 20 one-year anniversary of an invasion US
    President George W. Bush promised would make the world safer from terrorism.<br>
    <br>
	   The blast, which gouged a six-foot (two metre) wide, 10-foot deep crater,
    shows that the insurgents are 'still capable of spreading terror in the
    country,' US Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said.<br>

    </small></small></small></small></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">PESHAWAR: With the five-match one-day cricket series interestingly poised at 1-1, India's fate in the third ODI on Friday against traditional rivals Pakistan will hinge on the performance of their famed batting line-up that failed in Rawalpindi.<br>
    <br>
    Both captains - Inzamamul Haq and Sourav Ganguly - have realized that the team batting first have the job of setting up an imposing total which would be beyond reach of the team batting second.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In-form Ashish Nehra's injury-enforced absence would further deplete a struggling Indian bowling attack, which may find it hard to contain the Pakistanis on yet another beautiful batting track.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Though India would announce the final XI tomorrow, Irfan Pathan is likely to replace him.<br>
    <br>
    Seamer Amit Bhandari, who has joined the team in place of Nehra, is unlikely to be fielded straightaway.<br>
    <br>
    The path-breaking series has turned out to be a nightmare for the bowlers who have got very little assistance from the placid pitches in Karachi and Rawalpindi and the same fate awaits them in the remaining three matches.<br>
    <br>
    But even a total of 349 has not looked safe on such batting friendly tracks which means that the batsmen will have the onus to carry their team to safety.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Ganguly has predicted a "close series" and believes the batsmen, more than the bowlers, would have a much bigger role in the series considering the nature of tracks.<br>
    <br>
    "The way this one-day series is going it will be very difficult for any side to contain the opposition between 275 and 300. Whichever side is bowling first or second should make sure that they don't give more than 280 runs. Once the score gets to 330 it's very difficult for the side batting second," Ganguly said.<br>
    <br>
    "Unless something drastic happens this is going to be a series of big scores", he said referring to the four 300-plus scores made in the first two one-dayers of the five-match series.<br>
    <br>
    Pakistani bowlers who have also given away a lot of runs. They will be relying on fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to do as much damage as possible with sheer speed.<br>
    <br>
    Shoaib produced a fiery spell under floodlights in the last match at Rawalpindi returning with figures of 9-1-49-3 and Pakistan will be hoping for a similar show from their star bowler.<br>
    <br>
    Taking into account the batting tracks, the home team have strengthened their batting order by recalling the left-handed Taufiq Umar who scored a blistering 104 in a warm-up match against the Indians in Lahore in the sqaud.<br>
    <br>
    Paceman Iftikhar Rao and Misba-ul Haq have been omitted without playing in any of the two matches.<br>
    <br>
    Umar, the first choice opener in Test matches, was out of one-day team due to fine form of Yasir Hameed and Imran Farhat. Farhat was, however, dropped to accommodate dashing Shahid Afridi in the last match. Afridi celebrated his return to international cricket by cracking a 58-ball 80.<br>
    <br>
    Curator Agha Zahid said the track will be good for batting. "The people enjoyed the matches in Karachi and Rawalpindi and I hope we can have a good match in Peshawar too."&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
