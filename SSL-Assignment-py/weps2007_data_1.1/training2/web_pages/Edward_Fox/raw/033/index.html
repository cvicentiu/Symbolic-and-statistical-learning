<td colspan=3>Edward Fox<UL>
<LI>The link between Edward Fox and our ancestor, Justinian Fox, is circumstantial,
but seems correct. </LI>

<LI>Edward Fox was a clothmaker, as was his brother Richard. <BR>
<BR>
Richard was a long time member of the Society of Friends, as was <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/res1e0t7/fox9a.html">Francis
Fox</a>, the father of James Fox, who brought the 13 year old Justinian with
him to the new Pennsylvania colony in 1686. </LI>

<LI>Edward married Orringe Prest on June 7, 1664, and they had a daughter,
Susanna, 3/1664. </LI>

<LI>He married again, Mary Ball, May 25, 1667. The parish baptism records
for St. Charles Church, in Plymouth show that <A HREF="http://mysite.verizon.net/res1e0t7/fox7.html">Justinian
Fox</A> was baptized December 19, 1673. Another brother, John (4/1668),
and sister, Naomi (4/1674), were baptized at St. Andrews Church, Plymouth,
England. </LI>

<LI>Other official records concerning Edward Fox include: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>An Exchequer Bill in connection with the collection of the customs
at Plymouth in 1658. </LI>

<LI>From the Probate Registry of Exeter, England, in 1689, there appears
a Letter of Administration, on the estate of Joseph Fox, of Plymouth, &quot;Cloathyer,&quot;
granted to one Peter Foote with an appended &quot;renunciation&quot; by
&quot;Edward Fox of Plymouth, Worted-comber uncle and next of kine.&quot;
Joseph Fox was the son of Richard Fox, the previously mentioned brother
of Edward. </LI>

<LI>A lease, dated September 2, 1700, for 63 years, taken by Edward Fox,
of Plymouth, a Clothier,&quot; for a messauge, brewhouse, and appurtenances,
situated in the town of Plymouth, near &quot;the Great Tree.&quot; </LI>
</UL>

<LI>The relationship between Edward Fox and <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/res1e0t7/fox9a.html">Francis
Fox</a>, and subsequently
between their respective sons, Justinian Fox and James Fox, is not known.
The ties seem close though as the names of Richard and <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/res1e0t7/fox9a.html">Francis
Fox</a> occur
as witnesses to marriages on the same occasions and Richard Fox (Edward's
brother) witnessed the marriage of Francis Fox's son.</LI>
