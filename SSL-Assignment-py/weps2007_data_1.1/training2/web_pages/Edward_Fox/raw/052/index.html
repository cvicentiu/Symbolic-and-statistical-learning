          <tt>He was born at Dursley in 
          Gloucestershire, and may have been related to <b>
          <a title="Richard Fox" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RichardFox.htm">Richard Fox</a></b>. 
          He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge. 
          After graduating in
          1520, he 
          was made secretary to <b>
          <a title="Cardinal Wolsey" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/ThomasWolsey(Cardinal).htm">
          Cardinal Wolsey</a></b> in 1527. In
          1528 he was sent with <b>
          <a title="Stephen Gardiner" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/StephenGardiner.htm">Stephen 
          Gardiner</a></b> to
          Rome to 
          obtain from <b>Pope Clement VII</b> a decretal commission for the 
          trial and decision of the case between <b>
          <a title="Henry VIII of England" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">Henry VIII</a></b> and his first wife,
          <b><a title="Catherine of Aragon" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutCatalinadeAragon.htm">Catalina 
          of Aragon</a></b>.</tt><p><tt>On his return <b>Fox</b> was elected provost 
          of King's College, and in Aug 1529 was 
          the means of conveying to the king
          <b>
          <a title="Thomas Cranmer" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/Latimer,Ridley,Cranmer.htm#Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury">Thomas Cranmer</a></b>'s historic advice that he should apply to the 
          universities of Europe rather than to the <b>Pope</b>. This introduction led 
          eventually to <b>
          <a title="Thomas Cranmer" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/Latimer,Ridley,Cranmer.htm#Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury">Cranmer</a></b>'s promotion over 
          <b>Fox</b>'s head to the
          archbishopric of Canterbury. After a brief mission to
          Paris in Oct
          1529, <b>Fox</b> in Jan 1530 
          befriended
          <b>
          <a title="Hugh Latimer" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/Latimer,Ridley,Cranmer.htm#Hugh Latimer, Bishop of Worcester">Hugh Latimer</a></b> at Cambridge and took an active part in persuading 
          the English universities to decide in the <b>
          <a title="Henry VIII of England" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">King</a></b>'s favour. He was sent 
          to employ similar methods of persuasion at the French universities in 
          1530-1531, 
          and was also engaged in negotiating a closer league between England 
          and France. In Apr 1533 he 
          was prolocutor of
          convocation when it decided against the validity of <b>
          <a title="Henry VIII of England" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">Henry</a></b>'s 
          marriage with Catherine, and in 1534 
          published his treatise De vera differentia regiae potestatis et 
          ecclesiae (second ed. 1538, English transl 1548).</tt></p>
          <p><tt>Various ecclesiastical preferments were granted to him, including 
          the
          archdeaconry of Leicester (1531), the
          deanery of Salisbury (1533) and the bishopric of
          <a title="Hereford" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/bishops_of_hereford.htm">Hereford</a> (1535). In
          1535-1536 
          he was sent with <u><b><a href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/NicholasHeath.htm">Nicholas Heath</a></b></u> to Germany 
          to discuss the basis of a political and theological understanding with 
          the 
          Lutheran princes and divines, and had several interviews with
          <b>Martin Luther</b>, who could not be persuaded of the justice of <b>
          <a title="Henry VIII of England" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">Henry 
          VIII</a></b>'s divorce. The principal result of the mission was the
          Wittenberg articles of 1536, which had no slight influence on the 
          English
          Ten Articles of the same year. In 1536, <b>Bucer</b> dedicated to him his Commentaries on the Gospels, and 
          <b>Fox</b>'s
          Protestantism was also illustrated by his patronage of
          <b>Alexander Ales</b>, whom he defended before Convocation.</tt></p>
          <p><tt>Fox is credited with the authorship of several proverbial 
          sayings, such as '<i>the surest way to peace is a constant preparedness for war</i>' 
          and '<i>time and I will challenge any two in the world</i>'. The former at 
          any rate is only a variation of the Latin 'si vis pacem, para 
          bellum', and probably the latter is not more original in <b>Fox</b> than 
          in <b><a title="Philip II of Spain" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutFelipeII.htm">Felipe II of Spain</a></b>, to whom it is usually ascribed. 
          <b>Fox</b> was buried 
          in the church of
          St Mary Mounthaw,
          London. 
          He was the most Lutheran of <b>
          <a title="Henry VIII of England" href="http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/aboutHenryVIII.htm">Henry VIII</a></b>'s bishops, and was largely 
          responsible for the Ten Articles of 1536.</tt></div>
