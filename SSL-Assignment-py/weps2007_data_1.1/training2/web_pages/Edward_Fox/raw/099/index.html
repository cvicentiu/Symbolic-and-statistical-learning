<P><center><img src="edwfoxz.jpg"><br><strong>Edward Fox</strong><br>(1937 - )<p></center>He was so believable in every part he played that it was difficult to distinguish the actor from the character. Two films stand out in his distinguished career, "Day of the Jackal" and "A Bridge Too Far" in which he stole each scene from veteran stars. He was a tall, lean, fair-haired actor with a stiff-upper-lip, sleepy eyes and an aristocratic air about him. Military officers, upper-class and well bred types were the roles in which he was most often cast. He was born on April 13, 1937 in London, England the son of a theatrical agent and a playwright's daughter. Although his parents, Robin and Angela, didn't expect him to follow a theatrical vocation, Edward was determined to become an actor. His younger brother James set out at about the same time to seek an acting career. While James had pretty much immediate success, Edward struggled for a time in community repertoire theatre groups. Edward trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, was a product of Harrow and also served a stint in the Coldstream Guards which prepped him for the type of roles he played. Oddly, when James found religion and retired briefly from acting, Edward's career started to take-off. In the late 1950s he had married Tracy Reed, step-daughter of director Sir Carol Reed and they had a daughter, Lucy. The marriage ended in a few years and he had a nervous breakdown. He later met actress Joanna David and moved in with her. They have two children, Emilia and Freddy.
