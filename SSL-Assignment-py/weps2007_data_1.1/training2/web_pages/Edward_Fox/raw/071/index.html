Ames, Iowa, but I wouldn't be sure. When he taught 9th and 10th grades
in Springfield, he'd study ahead of his students. He had a lot of books
and got a lot of his knowledge for himself. His brothers were a little
jealous, I guess, because they always threw it up to him that they had

Alzina, 23 March 1902; buried beside her husband in Genoa.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Anthony's funeral was in the Methodist
church.&nbsp; He was buried in Valley View Cemetery, Genoa, in a section
on the southern side of the main gate, 10th row.&nbsp; An unpublished list
of old graves in the cemetery shows the burial, in addition to Anthony,
of Thomas Fox (probably Anthony's son), Mrs. Fox (probably Anthony's wife),
and Harry A. Fox (unidentified: b. born in Colfax County, Nebraska, died
30 October 1912,&nbsp; 26 yr. 5 mo.)&nbsp; [This information courtesy Gary
Zaruba].</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Anthony is said to have been named for
General "Mad" Anthony Wayne, 1745-1796. In addition to his exploits in
the Revolution, General Wayne commanded government forces in Ohio, 1792-1796,
during the war against the "Alliance." The 1850 Census for Ohio shows Anthony
Fox, stone cutter, in Olmstead, Cuyahoga, (Census, page 205), living with
his in-laws.&nbsp; Anthony was also counted in 1850 as living with his
sister, Wealthy, in Lorraine County, Ohio.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gary posits the possibility (by correspondence
in December 2002) that Anthony and Julia left Ohio about 1855, together
Anthony's sister, Wealthy, and her husband, George Cousins, and settled
near Peoria, Illinois, where Wealthy gave birth to one of her sons (1856).&nbsp;
The two couples stayed in this location briefly, then removed to Monroe
County, Iowa, where there were other Cousins.&nbsp; Then, in&nbsp; or about
1859 Anthony and his family joined his brother William in Illinois.</font>

Anthony was an unemployed farmer; he and Julia had been married forty-eight
years, they owned their house (with no mortgage), and had had 13 children,
10 of whom were still living.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The "Moses Francis" who died in 1853 (per
Anthony Fox's Bible) may have been an uncle (or, less likely, a cousin);
Susan Fox may have been Anthony's mother. The orthography of the last digit
of her death year is identical to that of Daniel Leffingwell, but difficult
to decipher -- looks like a "0," but is probably a "9."</font>
<br><img SRC="JLeffingwell(s).JPG" HSPACE=28 VSPACE=28 height=385 width=276 align=LEFT>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Until Summer 2000, we had no knowledge
of Anthony's origins, other than somewhat conflicting census data that
indicated the birth of his parent in New York or Ohio, and the suggestion
(also in census data) that his grandparents were from Scotland.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1999, we received correspondence from
Robin Bowman (a contract genealogist) and, in early 2000, from Gary Zaruba,
suggesting the possibility (based on geographic proximity over time) of
a relationship between Anthony and William Mark Fox.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Robin discovered William Mark Fox in Middleburgh,
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in the 1850 census with a wife (Ursula Wood), whom
he had married 17 July 1849, and his first child, Norman Lewis Fox; then,
in the censuses of 1860 and 1870, according to Robin, William Mark was
with his family in Jo Daviess County, where we find Anthony in the 1880
census.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gary tells us that there was a William
Fox in the Pleasant census district, Jo Daviess County, in 1850; but this
would appear not to be the William M. Fox that Robin and I find that year
in Middleburgh, Ohio. Gary goes on to say that he found William M. Fox
in Jo Daviess County (Thompson Township) in the 1860 census and Anthony
Fox in the same county (in Berryman Township) in the 1870 census [however,
though Mary Ann Legris, our cousin, found Anthony in Berryman, Jo Daviess
County,&nbsp; in the 1880 census, she found him in Stephenson County in
the 1870 census]. Gary thinks his ancestor, Myron Fox, who was born in
April 1854 in Jo Daviess County, was the son of William Mark Fox. Myron
married Sophia E. W. Spierling in Mount Carroll, Caroll County, Illinois
on 8 February 1873. By 1880, William Mark Fox had removed to Jackson County,
Iowa (across the river), but Myron is found in 1885 in Clear Creek precinct,
Saunders County, Nebraska, where we also find Anthony. By 1890, Anthony
had removed to Genoa, Nance County, Nebraska (<i>Nebraska Gazette</i>),
where we find him in the census of 1900. By then, Myron had also removed
to Nance County (near Belgrade).&nbsp; There was also a Leffingwell family
in Nance County (Genoa Township) in 1900: Ch[arles], a day laborer, born
January 1869 in Ohio (mother born in England); his wife Emma, born July
1875 in Sweden; and two children, Henry (age three) and Frank (age one).
The registry of marriages for Nance County shows that Charles D. Leffingwell,
28, born in Ohio, son of Julius and Mary (Lock) Leffingwell, married Emma
V. Johnson in Fullerton, 12 October 1896.&nbsp; Charles D. Leffingwell
appears to have been Julia's nephew.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There was also a Lydia Fox, who married
John Owen in Freeport, Stephenson County, Illinois in 1842; lived in Stephenson
County, Illinois (where the Anthony Fox family was) until 1870; and eventually
wound up in Saunders County, Nebraska, where we find the Anthony Fox family
in 1885.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps geography is merely coincidental.&nbsp;
On the other hand, we have definitive proof that the families of three
Foxes in question -- William, Lydia, and Anthony -- had familial "knowledge."&nbsp;
For example: Frank Curitan Owen, a son of Lydia (Fox) Owen, married Sarah
Ann Mitchell, daughter of George and Elizabeth Ann Vernon (Little) Mitchell,
whose daughter, Clara Jane Mitchell, married George W. Fox, son of Anthony.&nbsp;
Then, a few years later, after the death of his first wife, Anthony's son,
Albert R. Fox, married Belle E. (Rupe) Fox, widow of William M. Fox's son,
Lovel.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In June 2000, Gary Zaruba sent us correspondence
containing an "updated" version of a document that he believed to have
been written in the 1950's, then given to Agnes Fox McFarlin (a grand-daughter
of Myron Fox), who added names and dates during the 1960's and 1970's.&nbsp;
Agnes's daughter-in-law retyped the document in the 1990's to "correct
and clarify some of the data."&nbsp; In turn, Gary added pieces to incorporate
conclusions he had reached as a result of information we (Richard Bingham,
Mary Ann Legris, and Joyce Silva) and Robin Bowman had supplied.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the formatting that showed the contributions of various
parties disappeared in the e-mail transmission.&nbsp; However, the opening
lines (whether verbatim from the original document or the result of Gary's
interpretation is unknown) state:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The family of Fox was separated
when the parents died, their home burned with all records and the children
were very small. Only known children were William, Liddy (Lydia) and Anthony.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Subsequently, on 22 June 2000, Gary sent us
the following snippet, unchanged, from the same document, which he thinks
was composed by Mildred Skinner (deceased), Myron's grand-daughter:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Anthony Fox, brother to William
and Liddy Fox married.&nbsp; They had 13 children&nbsp; Among them a daughter
Phoebe Ruth who married Pete Kitner.&nbsp; The[ir] one son was Willie Kitner
and their daughter married Anthony Smith, a brother of Mrs. Will Ward of
Big Springs, Nebr.&nbsp; Myrtle Fox married --- Walker; there was also
Bert, Ed, Aaron, Tommy, Elsign, Alice, Mary, Pete And Geo. Fox, all cousins
of Myron Fox. Anthony Fox was born in Cleveland Ohio.&nbsp; Died March
1901 age 75 yrs. at Genoa Nebr.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, then, there seems to be no doubt that
Anthony had at least one sister, Lydia, and at least one brother, William
Mark.&nbsp; The remaining question: who were their parents.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Among the deaths of record in Anthony's
bible were Moses Francis Fox (1853) and Susan Fox (1859).&nbsp; Since these
individuals appear not to have been Anthony's children, we had every reason
to believe that they were (or may have been) his parents.&nbsp; The only
other vital stats recorded in this Bible are those of Anthony's children
and his wife's parents.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the other hand...</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a persistent tradition (among
descendants of Lydia and William) that the parents of the three siblings
both died when their children were very young.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to Gary (reporting the conclusion
of the aforementioned Robin Bowman):</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The parents are believed to be
Aaron Fox, born abt. 1803 in Vermont. He married Susan Alberd (or Albert),
born abt. 1805 in New York.&nbsp; Bowman obtained this information from
William’s second marriage in Jackson County, Iowa.&nbsp; [She] checked
on the Aaron Fox listings in 1850 for New York and none had Susan listed
as a spouse.&nbsp; There were two Aarons listed in [the] 1850 Ohio census,
but neither in Cuyahoga county. There was a Susan Fox,living with a group
of people in Cleveland, 1st ward, Cuyahoga County, in 1850. The census
listed Susan as blind. There seemed to be no relationship of several others
living&nbsp; there, all with different surnames except for one family.
Bowman goes on to state that she could not verify that this is the right
Susan Fox, but thought it should be noted since Susan might have been living
in some type of care home.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A closer examination of this census record
shows that Susan Fox, age 45 and blind, was living in the home of Seth
W. Abbey and his family (several children and his 81 year-old father).&nbsp;
Other tenants consisted of John Ingersoll and his wife and Laura Benedict
and her two daughters.&nbsp; Ingersoll's occupation was "merchant."&nbsp;
Benedict had an estate valued at $2,000.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If Anthony's parents died while he was
an infant, we have then to determine who were the Moses Francis Fox and
the Susan Fox he (or more likely his wife) named in his Bible.&nbsp; However,
the fact that Anthony named his first son "Aaron" seems to support Bowman's
conclusion.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Summer 2001, Kathie Harrison gave us
the following biography of Lydia Fox, written by Lydia's daughter, Josie
Owen Harrison:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lydia Ellen Fox was born in Cleveland,
Ohio on June 11, 1825. She had four sisters, Alzina Beebee, Adeline, Wealthy
and Mary. (Alzina's married name must have been Beebee); Wealthy married
a man by the name of Cousins; Adeline died apparently when very young,
and my mother cannot remember the name of Mary's husband. She had three
brothers -- Louis Fox, who was drowned at the age of 16, in Ohio. William
Fox, who lived the latter part of his life in Iowa, and who died in 1909
at the age of 93. Anthony Fox, who lived to be past 70 years of age and
who passed away at Genoa, Nebraska.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Her father's name was Aaron Fox, who died
rather young, leaving a wife and eight children, all small; three of the
youngest being given to families to raise. My Mother being given at the
age of nine, to this family "Cal Giddons", after which they came from Ohio
to Freeport, Illinois. This is the man my father came to work for and stayed
for three years. Our family was seven boys and five girls. They lost one

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My Mother [i.e., Lydia (Fox) Owen] passed
away March 29, 1909, at the age of 84 years, 5 months, 6 days. She lived
3 months, 12 days, of a longer life than my Father. They were married nearly
62 years. They are both laid to rest in the Ashland, Nebraska, cemetery</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Though Dr. Zaruba tells us that Lydia's account
has some inaccuracies -- as if genealogies were not replete with error
-- it does seem to confirm at least one of the "family traditions."&nbsp;
We might assume that the "Susan Fox" in the Anthony family Bible was Anthony's
mother, but, then are left to wonder about "Moses."&nbsp; The most likely
conclusion (barring evidence to the contrary) is that Moses was Aaron's
brother (hence, Anthony's uncle), who may have taken on Anthony and, perhaps,
other Fox children when Aaron died, leaving a blind widow incapable of
raising her young children alone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the business of family tradition:&nbsp;
Joyce (Ruth, George, Anthony) and Mary Ann (Nellie, John Edward, Anthony)&nbsp;
both independently spoke to me of Anthony's "Indian heritage" -- first
I had heard of it.&nbsp; Said Mary Ann: "Whenever Nell mentioned the Indian
connection she referred to Anthony as being a half-breed whose Mother was
a full-blood which made J. Ed a quarter and eligible for hunting and fishing
privileges on the reservation.&nbsp; J. Ed was a great fisherman -- many
of his catches were mounted and hung in the Pocatello Sporting Goods Store.
...&nbsp; J. Ed always hunted and fished on the Fort Hall Reservation."</font>

and settled on a farm near Genoa. Later on they moved to town where they
resided until the death of Mr. Fox, when the deceased went to Saunders
county to reside with one of her daughters. Since the death of her husband
Mrs. Fox commenced to decline.&nbsp; Never in the best of health the death
of her husband hastened the end, and her case rapidly developed into quick
consumption. Many years ago deceased united with the Methodist church,
and it was her faith in Christ and the hope beyond the grave she would
meet the husband and children who preceded her, that sustained her gentle
spirit as the hour approached for the last farewell on earth to her loved
ones. She felt that the parting was only temporary; that beyond that mysterious
river, which all humanity must some day cross to a brighter shore on the
other side, there would be a joyous reunion.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs.
Fox had more than her share of worry and trouble that come to most women.
She was the mother of thirteen children- six boys and seven girls. Three
times during her life she has stood at the bier of loved ones suddenly
cut off in the hour of health by accident.&nbsp; The first to precede her
was her first born - Frank - who was drowned in Ohio. The next to follow
was John <i>[i.e., Aaron</i>] who was killed by a B. &amp; M. train while
crossing the track at Ashland this state. The next victim was Alice, one

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Curiously, neither of the foregoing obituaries
mentions daughter Myrtle Frances (Walker) of New Raymer, Colorado.&nbsp;
The second obit notes the death of "her first born - Frank - who was drowned

is the Moses Francis whose death (in 1853) is recorded in Julia's Bible.&nbsp;
On the other hand, Julia's first born after marriage to Anthony was Frances
Myrtle, who was still alive, in New Raymer, in the 1930's.&nbsp; Note,
if you will, that Frances Myrtle was born (8 April 1851) just 8 months,
11 days after the marriage of her parents (27 August 1850).</font></blockquote>

accident follows:</font>

Thursday, August 23, 1883, Page 3, col. 5</font>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A TERRIBLE FATE!</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Aaron Fox Run Over by
the Cars and Instantly Killed</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>From the Ashland Gazette</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This town was thrown into excitement last Friday morning by the report
that a man had been run over and killed by the cars at the depot crossing.&nbsp;
Soon large crowds went to the scene and found the report too true.&nbsp;
About one hundred yards south of the depot, and a short distance from the
water tank was the dead and mangled body of Aaron Fox.&nbsp; On the opposite
side of the track was the running gear of the wagon almost broken into
splinters, while near the crossing was the bed of the wagon.&nbsp; The
track for some distance was strewn with the blood of the victim.&nbsp;
Upon investigation it was found that the head had been crushed out of ____
semblance and nothing of it remained but the scalp.&nbsp; A part of the
skull containing an eye and the upper jaw bone were found beside the track,
while the splintered rails bore evidence that the body had been dragged
over them as pieces of his clothing were fastened to the splinters.&nbsp;
It was a sickening sight and will not soon be forgotten by those who saw
the disfigured body.&nbsp; From an eye witness of the sad affair, it seems
that a special train bearing an excursion party of KnightsTemplar en route
for San Francisco to attend the conclave in that city, came thundering
down past the depot at a high rate of speed and as the engineer failed
to ring the bell the rapid approach of the train was not noticed by the
deceased.&nbsp; Fox, it appears, was standing up in his wagon, unconscious
of his impending death and was even warned by Max Swerdberger that the
train was coming but he did not hear the the warning and drove onto the
track.&nbsp; The pilot of the engine caught the wagon, but the horses managed
to break loose and escaped unhurt.&nbsp; The body was removed to town and
the coroner sent for who did not arrive until Saturday, when the inquest
was held.&nbsp; They returned a verdict that the deceased came to his death
by being struck by the locomotive while the same was running at an unusual
rate of speed while passing the depot.&nbsp; The deceased was nearly 30
years of age and was well known in Ashland and vicinity.&nbsp; He leaves
a wife and a child a few weeks old who have the sympathy of this entire
community.&nbsp; The Lincoln Journal says:&nbsp; After leaving Ashland
Mr. Scott, one of the excursionists, passed through the train and collected
$120 for the widow of the dead man and on arrival at Lincoln handed it
to superintendent Thompson, to forward to the widow with the following
note:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“One hundred and twenty dollars, collection taken up for benefit of family
of man killed by Knights Templar excursion train at Ashland.&nbsp; New
York state battalion, commanded by Michigan state battalion, commanded
by J. E. Sexton, grand commander.&nbsp; Big hearted John Scott, collector.&nbsp;
J. E. Sexton, Detroit, Michigan, Charles Bartlett, Elmira, N. Y.”</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These people wished their sympathy conveyed to the bereaved ones, but all
who saw the accident state that no one was to blame but the man himself.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are sure that the widow of Mr. Fox will fully appreciate this expression
of sympathy of the Knights Templar from the east, and will always think
kindly of “big hearted John Scott.”</font></font>

Alada</b> <b>Fox</b> , born in Stephenson County or Jo Daviess County,
Illinois 28 July 1869; died in Saunders, Nebraska, 10 July 1889 (7 July
according to Julia's Bible). Alice appears to have married an Emmit about
1887 or before, but no record of the marriage has been found, and the presumption
that it happened is based on a certificate, issued in Custer County, Nebraska,
7 October 1888, for the marriage of Joseph Moody to Alice Emmit, daugther
of A. Fox and Julia Leffingwell.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lacking proof for the marriage to Emmit,
we might hold out for the possibility that "Emmit" in the Moody certificate
was a clerk's error for "Alada."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Story told to Mary Ann Legris, granddaughter
of J. Edward. Fox, by her mother (Nellie Fox McCaskill): Alice had a son
Leslie (14 Apr 1888) out of wedlock. She was sent to live with Mike and
[Sarah] Jane Campbell. A bit of matchmaking went on and she married the
farmer on the adjacent farm. It was thought that his name was Ewing (but
perhaps it was Moody). One morning when Alice was stoking the fire in the
cookstove she paused to see if the fire would catch and heard some choking
sounds from the baby. She darted back into the bedroom and discovered her
husband choking the baby. She still had the poker in her hand and she hit
Moody (or Ewing) over the head with it. He dropped the baby and ran. She
wrapped up the baby, got on her pony and rode to her sister's house. Leaving
the baby with Jane and, against her sister's advice to wait for the men
to return from the fields, she returned to her home to get clothing for
the baby. A young boy herding cattle into a pasture on a small rise across
the road from her farm heard a horse and saw her dismount the pony, lead
him through the gate, and turn the latch to the gate. As she turned, her
husband stepped out from the bush and shot her in the chest with a shotgun,
placed her body next to the gate and covered her chest and face with her
apron. The young boy ran back to his home and told his mother of the shooting.
She rang the dinner bell to call the men in from the fields. A posse was
formed -- Ewing's [Moody's]&nbsp; body was found about twilight in a shallow
pond of water (7 July 1889). Jane and Mike were not able to keep the baby
Leslie and he was sent to Anthony and Julia. She cared for him with great
difficulty because she suffered from arthritis. When Anne LaRue and J.
Ed. Fox were married, they took this child and raised him. Leslie moved
to Idaho were he worked for the O.S.L. Railroad as an engineer. He was
married and had an adopted son. He was in an automobile accident and died
the next day from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a glass splinter from
the windshield (20 June 1929). J. Ed. took Les's wife and her child to
her family in Oelwien, Iowa, and Les was buried in Oelwien. His widow died
not long afterwards from cancer. Her family raised the child.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On 21 June 2003 we received information
from Gary (Z) and Mary Jane (L) that confirmed the substance of Nellie's
story, but amended some important details, to wit:&nbsp; Alice had been
sent to live, not with with her sister, Sarah Jane Campbell, but with her
sister Harriet C. and brother-in-law Ransom Herrington, who lived on a
farm/ranch about seven miles east by southeast of Westerville, Custer County,
Nebraska.&nbsp; A bachelor (Joel A. or Joseph M. Moody) lived near the
Herringtons; he married Alice in the Herrington home on 7 October 1888.&nbsp;
Joel (or Joseph) Moody murdered Alice 10 July 1889 at the home of Squire
G. D. Rose, who lived near the Herringtons.&nbsp; According to the Custer
County Republican, Alice and Joel separated on 6 July and Alice went to
stay with Harriet.&nbsp; According to Zaruba, the paper reported that the
couple had not lived together agreeably since winter, and the two parties
had agreed to meet at Squire's place, 11 July, to divide their property.&nbsp;
At that time, Joel (Joseph) asked Alice to remove with him to Washington
(state).&nbsp; When Alice refused, according to reports, Joel shot her
twice, then later shot himself.&nbsp; G. D. Rose's son witnessed the murder.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Aaron Fox</b>, married <b>Susan Albert
(or Alberd)</b>.&nbsp; Identification of Susan's surname provided (hypthetically)
by Bowman.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Conundrum: We have no reason to doubt the
identity of Anthony's father (Aaron), who is named in Lydia's biography
(<i>supra</i>), but Lydia does not give us the name of her mother.&nbsp;
This information has been supplied (correctly or not) by Bowman.&nbsp;
Lydia states that, on the death of Aaron, the three youngest children were
"given to families to raise."&nbsp; The three youngest would appear to
have been Lydia (1825), William (1826, unless Lydia is correct in saying
he was 93 when he died in 1909), and Anthony (1828).&nbsp; If the date
of Lydia's birth is correct and if she was placed with another family when
she was nine, her father, Aaron, would have died in or a bit before 1834.&nbsp;
According to Bowman, Aaron was born in Vermont about 1803, in which case
he would have died at or before age thirty-one.&nbsp; That means that he
sired Lydia when he was, maybe, twenty-two.&nbsp; However, if he had five
children before Lydia he would had to have begun propagating before age
seventeen.&nbsp; It is possible, of course, that Adeline, who "apparently
died young," and Mary both were born after Anthony, and that both died
before the death of Aaron, leaving a family of six children, in which case
Aaron could have married Susan, and begun propagating as late as, say,
1822 (i.e., at age nineteen).&nbsp; Susan, his wife would have been, maybe
seventeen.&nbsp; Whatever the case we are pushing the biological-demographic-statistical
envelope -- unless Bowman is wrong in her estimates of Aaron's and Susan's
birth dates.&nbsp; However, if William was born in 1816 (as Lydia's biography
suggests), and Susan (Aaron's wife) was born about 1805, as Bowman suggests,
Susan would have been just eleven or twelve years old at the time -- an
unlikely possibility.&nbsp; We have here, obvious problems, which (we understand)
our cousins Gary Zaruba and Mary Ann Legris are working to solve.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the 1830 Census for Rockport, Cuyahoga
County, we find Aaron Fox in a household of nine consisting, presumably,
of himself (age 30 to 39), his wife (age 20 to 29), and seven children
-- one boy and two girls under five; one boy and one girl between five
and and nine, and one boy and one girl between ten and fourteen years of
age.&nbsp; Assume, for the sake of argument, that this census data is accurate,
and this Aaron is the father of our Anthony.&nbsp;&nbsp; The discrepancy
between Lydia's biography (naming eight children) and the census (which
shows seven) is easily explained:&nbsp; either Louis or Adeline died before
1830, or one of the daughters was born after 1830.&nbsp; So, then, knowing
with certainty only the birth dates of Lydia and Anthony, we can conclude
the following:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(1)&nbsp; Aaron Fox was born in
or before 1800</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(2)&nbsp; His wife was born after 1800,
but probably not long after.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(3)&nbsp; In 1830, they had three sons:&nbsp;
one under five (Anthony, born 1828), one between five and ten (probably
William), and one between ten and fifteen (probably Louis).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(4)&nbsp; In 1830, they had four daughters:&nbsp;
two under five, one between five and ten (Lydia, barely five), and one
between ten and fifteen.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, we would have the following birth order:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1.&nbsp; Louis (or a daughter)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2.&nbsp; A daughter (or Louis)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3.&nbsp; William</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4.&nbsp; Lydia</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5.&nbsp; A daughter (or Anthony)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6.&nbsp; Anthony (or a daughter)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7.&nbsp; A daughter</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8.&nbsp; A daughter (born after the census)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">If this birth order is correct, Lydia would
not have been one of the three youngest.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, subsequent research, mostly conducted
by Gary Zaruba, with the assistance of Mary Ann Legris, suggests the following
birth order:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1. William (1816)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2. Alzina (1817)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3, 4, and 5.&nbsp; Louis, Mary, and/or
Adeline</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6. Lydia (1825)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7. Anthony (1828)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8. Wealthy (1830)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The notion that Aaron's wife was Susan Albert
[or Alberd] comes to us by way of Robin Bowman.&nbsp; The record of deaths
in Anthony's Bible seems to confirm the "Susan" part, but fails to give
us a surname.&nbsp; The notion that Aaron died "early" and the family split
as a result is based on family tradition, supported (apparently) by Josie's
biography of her mother (Lydia).&nbsp; There is, however, another possibility
that may be worth considering.&nbsp; In the 1840 census for Brecksville
(Cuyahoga), Ohio, we find a record for "Mrs. A. Fox" (obviously a widow)
with the following household members -- one male, 10 to 14 (Anthony?);
two males, 15 to 19 (Louis and William?); two females, five to nine (perhaps
children seven and eight, as listed above?); one female, 10 to 14 (another
daughter?); one female, 15 to 19 (Lydia?); and one female, 40 to 49 (Aaron's
widow?).&nbsp; There are seven children in this list; Aaron had eight,
but remember, according to Josie/Lydia, one daughter (perhaps the first)
"died young."&nbsp; Also if the 1830 census data for Aaron is correct,
his widow should have been between 30 and 39 in 1840 -- but, then, census
data is not always absolutely reliable.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lydia's biography, written by her daughte
says: "My Mother being given at the age of nine, to this family 'Cal Giddons,'
after which they came from Ohio to Freeport, Illinois."</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr. Zaruba writes (2 December 2002):</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the "Memorial
for Pioneer Women of the Western Reserve" for Rockport, Ohio, is a brief
biography for "Mrs Calvin Giddings (Mary Bennett), born in Jefferson county,
NY., in 1805; was adopted by an uncle when three years of age and brought
to Ashtabula, OH in 1808." She married Calvin Giddings and they lived in
Rockport. She had nine boys and at least one daughter, Mrs Giddeon Pease
who was the only one of her children living in Rockport in 1896.</font></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is no evidence
that this Cal Giddings ever moved to Stephenson county, IL. . . . Ralph
Giddings, author of the&nbsp; "The Giddings of North America" could not
find a Lydia Fox connected to the Giddings family, but he believes there
must be a connection. From his Giddings database he supplied the following
information that could make part or all of the story correct. He believes
Calvin Giddings never moved to Stephenson co., but Calvin's father, the
Rev. Harris Giddings and some of Calvin's brothers did migrate to Stephenson
county in 1834 and spent the rest of their lives there. There were several
Calvin Giddings who were either a son or grandsons of the Rev. Harris Giddings'
descendants. Calvin's brother, Jabez named a son Calvin who lived near
Freeport, Stephenson county. There was also another Calvin Giddings from
Foreston, IL who enrolled in Co. D, 93rd IL Vol. Inf. which organized in
Freeport. This Calvin was born 20 Feb 1842 at Freeport, IL and was the
son of Sanford Jabez and Permelia (Sheets) Giddings.&nbsp; Stephenson county
land records show that four of Calvin's brothers, Alfred H., Jabez, Sandford
Jabez., and Smith H. purchased land tracts in the county between 1845 and
1848.&nbsp; There were other relatives of Calvin who were purchasing land
in the area as early as 1841. Ralph Giddings has another Calvin Harris
Giddings in his database who married Charlotte Story April 11, 1848/9 in
Elvira, Cuyahoga county, OH. They had two daughters, Ellen and unknown
name.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Perhaps there is not a connection
between one of these Giddings families and Lydia Fox, but the dates, migration
to Stephenson county and the absence of a Giddons family in Cuyahoga and
Stephenson counties gives strong support to the assumption.</font></font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Joyce Silva (daughter of Ruth) has graciously
supplied us with a copy of her Aunt Ethel's brief autobiography and much
longer "Life and Times of Clara Jane Mitchell Fox," from which we have
extracted salient features of her life and that of her husband. George
W. apparently courted and married Clara Jane in Ashland, Saunders, Nebraska.
After the death of their second child (Charles) George and Clara relocated
to Iliff, Colorado (on the North Platte River, about ten miles northeast
of Sterling), where George taught "a little school." George and his family
returned to Eastern Nebraska (Valparaiso) about 1891, then moved on to
Springfield, where they remained for about six years, during which time
George and Clara affiliated with the Methodist church. They removed to
Millard in 1896, and to Benson (a suburb of Omaha) in 1899, where George
served as school principal. The family relocated to Boulder, Montana, about
1902, and to Soda Springs, Idaho in 1907. George gave up teaching in 1908
to sell life insurance and removed to Pocatello, Idaho, about 1911, thinking
he could do better there with his insurance work. In 1916, George and Clara
bought their first home in Pocatello (653 North Arthur), which they sold
in 1932 when, to escape the cold Idaho winters, George decided to relocate
to California, where he died in 1935; Clara died there in 1955.</font>

record, Daniel and Angelina were both born in New York; their children

home) was $400.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a D. Leffingwell in Dover, Cuyahoga
in the 1840 census (page 163), showing in the household two males (one
under five and one between 30 and 39) and five females (one under five,
one between five and nine, one between fifteen and nineteen, one between

Dover is the same person as Daniel Leffingwell of Olmstead, there should
be some correlation among the bodies.&nbsp; The one male under five could
be Julius; the other male is in the right age range to be Daniel.&nbsp;
The one female under five could be Henrietta; Julia would be the one between
five and nine; the one between 60 and 69 could have been the mother of
either Daniel or Angelina (more likely the latter, we think).&nbsp; However,
if the woman between 30 and 39 is Angelina, wife of Daniel, her age in

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have no certain knowledge regarding
the parents of Angelina (Chase) Leffingwell.&nbsp; However, census data
for Ohio presents two possibilities:&nbsp; From the 1820 census, a Benjamin
Chase and a Daniel Chase, both in Bedford, each had in their household
one "free white female under ten years"&nbsp; (Angelina was born about
1812).&nbsp; We don't find Benjamin in Bedford in the 1830 census, but
we do find Daniel, age 40 to 49, with two males (we presume his sons) aged
10 to 14, two females under five years of age (presumable daughters), one
15 to 19 (Angelina?), and one 40 to 49 (presumably his wife).&nbsp; We
find a Daniel Chase in Bedford again in 1840, but with anomalies that we
cannot reconcile with the data for 1830.&nbsp; Of course it is quite possible
