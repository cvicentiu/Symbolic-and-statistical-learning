It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because <A HREF="http://edwardfox.grabafreebie.com/index.htm">because</A> the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, &#8220;I see, I see!&#8212;avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.&#8221;<P>As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and <A HREF=http://edwardhoward.grabafreebie.com/Home.php>and</A> then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, &#8220;Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!&#8212;an arm and a leg!&#8212;an arm that never can shrink, d&#8217;ye see; and a <A HREF=http://edwardhunt.grabafreebie.com/Interest.php>a</A> leg that never can run. Where did&#8217;st thou see the White Whale?&#8212;how long ago?&#8221;<P>&#8220;The White Whale,&#8221; said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; &#8220;there I saw him, on the Line, last season.&#8221;<P>&#8220;And he took that arm off, did he?&#8221; asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman&#8217;s shoulder, as he did so.<P>&#8220;Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Spin me the yarn,&#8221; said Ahab; &#8220;how was it?&#8221;<P>&#8220;It was the first time in my life that I <A HREF=http://edwardkent.grabafreebie.com/About.php>I</A> ever cruised on the Line,&#8221; began the Englishman. &#8220;I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so that my boat&#8217;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows&#8217; feet and wrinkles.&#8221;<P>&#8220;It was he, it was he!&#8221; cried Ahab, suddenly letting <A HREF=http://edwardkemp.grabafreebie.com/Contact.php>letting</A> out his suspended breath.<P>After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him. Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and both descended with a feeling of relief. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s made of iron!&#8221; exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni.<P>&#8220;Of forged iron,&#8221; replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast.<P>At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country soon presented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded <A HREF=http://edwardlewis.grabafreebie.com/index.htm>succeeded</A> the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with scanty shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite. All this portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith. The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding across-country, made angry arid threatening motions. The Parsee avoided them as much as possible. Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter.<P>In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would he sell him, or set him free? The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration. Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.<P>The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined bungalow. They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.<P>The night was cold. The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously. The conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave place to loud and steady snores. The guide watched Kiouni, who slept standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree. Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although occasional growls front panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow. Sir Francis slept heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue. Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before. As for Mr. Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row.<P> </BODY></HTML>
