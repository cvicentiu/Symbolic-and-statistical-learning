<br>
<b><u>Alexander & William Macomb:</u></b>  The first legal owners of <i>Grosse Ile</i>, were born in Ireland and came to America with their parents, <b>John</b> and <b>Jane (Gordon) Macomb</b>, in 1755, at the ages of seven and four.  There was also a sister, <b>Anne</b>.  The brothers became large real estate owner, in New York, as well as in Michigan.  At one time they owned nearly all the islands in the <i>Detroit River</i>, acquiring <i>Grosse Ile</i>, in 1776.  It would seem that later they sold much of the land on <i>Grosse Ile</i>, as some of the early pioneers bought tracts at a public sale of lands in New York.  
<br>The <b>Macomb</b> brothers possessed wonderful business ability, carry on an enormous mercantile business, with its headquarters in <i>Detroit</i>, reaching not only to the colonies, but into Canada as well.  They were often referred to as "merchant princes."
<br><b>Alexander Macomb</b>, the elder brother (later the father of Major General Alexander Macomb) married, first to <b>Catherine Navarre</b>, the daughter of <b>Robert Navarre</b>, who was Notaire Royal of the French colony at <i>Detroit</i>, from the first establishment of the colony.  There were nine children from this marriage, the seventh being <b>Alexander Macomb Jr</b>, who is the only one of the nine children to have descendants still living on the island.  His daughter, <b>Alexandrine</b>, married an officer in the army named, <b>Stanton</b>, and from them, came the <b>Stanton</b> residents.
<br>
<b>Alexander</b> Sr's second wife, <b>Jane Rucker</b>, widow of <b>John Peter Rucker</b>, a merchant in New York.  By her he had seven more children, total of sixteen in all.  None of these descendants lived on <i>Grosse Ile</i>.
<br>
<b>William Macomb</b> Sr, married <b>Sarah Jane Dring</b>, a descendant of a Huguenot family who fled from France to England after the Edict of Nantes had been revoked.  They had eleven children.  <b>William Macomb Jr</b>, and his sister,<b> Sarah Macomb-Rucker</b> are closely identified with the early history of <i>Grosse Ile</i>, ten heads of families in 1880 being direct descendants of this brother and sister.  <b>William Sr</b>, some years previous to the surrender of <i>Detroit</i>, by <b>Hull</b>, built a beautiful home on <i>Grosse Ile</i>, which he named the "Mansion House", after his New York residence at 39 Broadway, near Old Trinity Church. The later had been built by him in 1786 as a family residence, and was at one time Washington's headquarters, where he received from <b>LaFayette</b>, through <b>Thomas Paine</b>, the Key of the Bastille.  He died in <i>Detroit</i> April 16, 1796.  Aside from providing well for his family, he left an annuity to his aged father.
<br><b>William Macomb Jr</b> was the sixth child of this family.  His father, in his wiill,  had left all of this real estate to his three sons, <b> John W., William</b>, and <b>David B.</b> Macomb.  It would seem that the <i>Grosse Ile</i> properties fell into the hands of <b>William Jr</b>, for about the time of the War of 1812, he was occupying the Mansion House, with his young wife, <b>Monique Navarre</b>, and their son, <b> Pierre</b>, and servants.  When the prisoners at the time of <b>Hull's</b> surrender were taken from <i>Detroit</i> to Toronto, on the <i>Brig Queen Charlotte</i> <b>William Jr</b> was among them, along with another <i>Detroit</i> native resident,<b> Judge Abbott</b>.  <B>William</b> had incurred the displeasure of the <i>Fox Indian Tribe</i> by having a sweetheart in their tribe, who , upon hearing that he had married a French lady, drowned herself.  The Natives, for revenge, decided to destroy his home.  One evening, <b>Mrs Macomb</b>, alone and unprotected with her son and servants, saw a number of small boats moving quietly toward the shore.  It proved to be a small fleet of canoes filled with Native Americans.  Fearing some evil she hurriedly gave the alarm to her household, and wrapped her baby in a blanket and started for the forest behind the house.  There, she saw the Native Americans dancing around the ruins of her burning home, and dared not proceed until they returned to their boats.
<br>How she made the dreadful journey to <i>Detroit</i> is not known.  There was only one bridge across the River, at the upper end of the island.  Some small boat could have taken her to <i>Trenton,</i>, and from there on foot she probably traveled the 18 miles to <i>Detroit</i>, in the dark night sky.  She reached friends in the village, and soon after she died of pneumonia, the result of exposure, in November 1813.  Baby <b> Pierre</b> was born in 1812, and according to family records, died in 1866, unmarried.
<br>Some years later, <b>William</b> married a second time, to <b> Jeanette Marentete</b>, and rebuilt further south, but still on the area of <i>Mansion Block</i>.  This tract extended entirely across the island, and the <b>Rucker, Keith</b> and <b>Smith</b> farms, later occupied the western portions.  <b> Jeanette</b> brought forth four children; a son, <b> Tronville</b>, who left home when he was quite young and was never heard from; and three daughters, <b>Jane, Archange</b> and <b> Catherine</b>, all of whom married and lived side by side until their deaths.  <b>Jane </b>, the eldest, married <b>Lieutenant Henry Brevoort</b>.  Their eldest son, <b>William</b> a lieutenant in the Civil War, met his death by Colonel Thornton Brodhead's regiment.  <b> Henry</b>, the second son, was a prominent lawyer in <i>Detroit</i> for many years. <b>Thornton</b>, the youngest, died before <b>Henry</b>, having lived as a resident of <i>Grosse Ile</i>.
<br><b>Archange</b>, the second sister, married <i>Colonel Thornton Brodhead</b> (the same man who's regiment killed <b> William</b>) and bore six children, <b>Josephine, Marian, John, Ellen, Katherine</b> and <b>Elizabeth</b>.  <b>Josephine</b> married a Canadian government officer, <b> Balfour</b>, and lived in Toronto.  <b>Marian </b> married <b>John K. Webster</b>. <b>John</b> married the niece of <b>Nathaniel P. Willis</b>, a author in <i>Detroit</i>, and <b>Elizabeth</b> married <b>Frederick Howard</b>.
<br>
<b>Catherine Macomb</b> married <b>John Wendell</b>, and had a large family:  <b>Oscar, Catherine, Mary, Susan, Jane, Edith, </b>, and <b>Lilian</b>.  Of these only 3 remained as residents of <i>Grosse Ile, <b>Edith, Oscar</b> and <b>Lilian</b>.
<br>
<b>William Macomb Jr</b> met his death from a kick by an ox, and was buried on land that his son would have inherited, had he returned.  When her children were grown, <b>Mrs Macomb</b> remarried to <b>Thomas Lewis</b>, and had one daughter,<b> Eliza</b>.  <b>Eliza</b> later married <b>Dallas Norvell</b>.
<br>About 3 miles below the <b>Macomb</b> Mansion House stood the old Stockade.  It was built on the eastern river bank, on land belonging to <b>Alexander Macomb</b>, who was then commander in chief of the Army in <i>Detroit</i>.  It extended from the river several hundred feet west, bordering on the north near the old <b>Lowrie</b> home, then south about 200 feet, and back to the river, enclosing several acres.  There was an entrance to the barracks on the north, and another leading down stone steps to the water on the east.  There were seven log houses within the enclosure; a large one with a hall extending through the center, running east and west, with three rooms on each side.  There were the officer's quarters.  Two smaller buildings at the rear, and two near the front formed the soldier's quarters.  Several of the buildings were put together with wooden pins and hanging doors.  Joining the larger building at the west was a frame part, added for a kitchen.  Wrought iron nails were used for this building.  A root house for vegetables stood on the northeast corner, and five poplar trees were planted along the front.
<br>This fort was built as a protection against the Native Americans, who frequently made raids on the livestock.  About 1815, the Native Americans had become so troublesome, terrifying the families, that it was considered necessary to provide a guard.  A boat load of soldiers, under <b>Corporal John B. Jones</b> of the 5th United States infantry, was sent to prevent further disorder.  One incidence concerning <b>William Macomb</b> was when a tribe of <i>Kickapoo</i> landed  and surrounded settlers, and starting taking prisoners.  One <i>Kickapoo</i> fired upon <b>Macomb</b>, however by being quicker, he had shot the Native first.  Old pioneers had said that this Native American was buried under a basswood tree, which stood on the bank, overlooking the ravine, and during construction of a road, a skeleton was unearthed on the hillside, where the fallen brave was said to have been interred.  This tree was known as the "Treaty Tree".  The old basswood itself is gone, but a small tree marks this spot, and some older residents claim to have pictures of this tree.

Denmark and Canton, in the old log books are proofs of some of his far journeys.  While in Washington he refitted the brig, "Wasp" and sailed it for some time.  Later this ship was to become famous in the War of 1812, at Perry's Victory, after which it disappeared.  In leaving it <b>Captain Keith</b> must have taken with him a keepsake, for in the garret of the old <b>Keith</b> home stood a ship's clock, on a glass door, with a tiny ship painted on it, marked "Wasp".
<br><b>Captain Keith</b> commanded the first revenue cutter on the Lake, and was sent to Mackinac Island to drive the British from it, but they had evacuated.  He returned in time to get into the Battle of Lake Erie, and fought through it.  His boat was taken for a hospital.  The Queen Charlotte, which carried the prisoners from <i>Detroit</i> to Toronto, after Hull's surrender, was also in the battle.  It was sunk and afterward bought and raised by a New York company, and <b>Captain Keith</b> sailed it for 5 additional years.  He then brought his family from Alexanderia, near Washington, to <i>Grosse Ile</i>, where a log house was built in 1819.  In 1829, their colonial house was built.  Six of his eight children were born there.  In the early 1850s, and after the death of <b>Captain Keith</b>, <b>Mrs. Keith</b> received a Land Grant from the Government, "for services rendered by <b>Captain Keith</b> at Perry's  Victory".
<br>The eldest son, <b>William</b>, died in infancy.  After him came <b>David, John, Margaret, Angus, Alexander, Edward, another William,</b> and <b>Jane</b>, the youngest who later became the wife of <b>John Rucker</b>.
