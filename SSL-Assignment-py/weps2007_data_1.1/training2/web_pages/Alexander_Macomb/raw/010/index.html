Macomb served as the Army's Adjutant General in 1812, and later as General in 
Chief of the Army from 1828 until his death in 1841. He was one of the first 
officers to receive formal military training at West Point. Maj. Gen. Macomb was 
a Soldier/ Scholar/General throughout his life publishing books and articles and 
becoming well known in his day for community involvement. He espoused the 
position that the commanding general should have active command of the whole 
Army including the staff bureaus, under loose supervision of the secretary of 
war; the increase of enlisted pay to discourage desertion; the augmentation of 
officers in the service branches to free line officers for field duty; relief 
for widows and orphans of regular officer victims of wounds and disease; and a 
system of officer retirement and replacement.</font></p>
