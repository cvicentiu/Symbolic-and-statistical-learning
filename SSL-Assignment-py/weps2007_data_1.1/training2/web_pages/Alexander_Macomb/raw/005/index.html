After the war, he was employed by the Khedive of Egypt, and made the first survey of Lake Albert Nyanza.  Gen. Gordon appointed him Governor of Equatorial Africa.  In 1877, he was sent to negotiate peace between the Soudanese and Abyssinians, and was at Kartoun with Gordon in 1878.  In 1884, he became Governor of the Soudan, by appointment of the Khedive; and he held many important positions there; including that of Director Genreal of Public Lands.
