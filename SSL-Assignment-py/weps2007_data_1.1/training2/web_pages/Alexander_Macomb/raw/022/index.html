<hr>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Early Mount Clemens was served by a number of rural school districts whose pupils were
housed in various quarters until 1857, when several districts in Mount Clemens and Clinton
and Harrison Townships were consolidated to form <strong>Union School District No. 1,
Fractional, of the Townships of Clinton and Harrison</strong>. This Union School District
was the forerunner of today's <strong><a href="http://www.mtclemens.k12.mi.us/">Mount Clemens Community School District</a>.</strong>
After the Union School District was formed, its leaders began to construct schoolhouses to
meet the needs of the growing community. The following school buildings have been a part
of the Union School District and/or Mount Clemens Community School District since 1857:<br>
<br>
<strong>CLEMENS SCHOOL </strong>- Originally called the Court Street School, the building
was erected at 141 Court St. in 1885. In about 1925 it was renamed in honor of <strong>Christian
Clemens</strong>, the founder of Mount Clemens. The old building was razed in 1958. A new
Christian Clemens school was opened on Stepnitz St., at the foot of Scott, in 1952. The
school was closed in 1988; in 1998 it houses the <strong>Salvation Army Harbor Light
Center</strong>.</font> </p>
