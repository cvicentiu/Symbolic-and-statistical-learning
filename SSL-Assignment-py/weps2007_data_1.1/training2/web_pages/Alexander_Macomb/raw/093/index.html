                for the position. Their quarrels scandalized the Army and drove

Macomb was commissioned in the Corps of
Engineers in 1802; spent 5 years in charge of coastal fortifications in the
Carolinas and Georgia; and served in the Artillery in the War of 1812. His
wartime service won him a brevet major generalcy and a congressional gold medal.
After commanding the Third Military District at New York and the Fifth at
Detroit, he became Chief Engineer in 1821.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Macomb’s tenure as Commanding General
(29 May 1828-25 June 1841) was marked by continuing uncertainty about the
responsibilities and authority of his position. To secure his seniority over the
other two-star brevet major generals, Macomb added a provision in the1834
Regulations that &quot;<i>the insignia of the major general commanding in chief
should be three stars</i>.&quot; In the same document he sought to define his
relationship to the Secretary of War and establish his primacy over the bureau
chiefs, including his successor as Chief of Engineers. This was easier said than
done. Most issues were not fully resolved until early the next century.</font>

        </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Macomb also advocated doubling Army
strength, increasing enlisted pay, relief for widows and orphans, and a
regularized officer retirement and replacement system. During his tenure (1840)
the Army adopted the castle uniform insignia and first described the Corps’
distinctive Essayons button. Macomb died in office on 25 June 1841. Major
General Winfield Scott, who had worked hard at mending fences in the intervening
13 years, was named his successor.

<br>
<br>
Four other Commanding Generals, or Chiefs of Staff as they became known after
the Army’s reorganization in 1903, held Engineer commissions early in their
careers. All transferred to other branches before rising to the top. They were
George B. McClellan, Henry W. Halleck, Douglas MacArthur, and Maxwell D. Taylor.</font>
