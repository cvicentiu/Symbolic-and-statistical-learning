   <dd>This building is described glowingly. "The edifice is one of the ornaments of the city of Macomb presenting in its front view the appearance of a palatial mansion of some railway magnate." Quoting further "The architectural design is modern, very neat and well proportioned, presenting on a whole, a light, cheerful appearance." This building as wonderful as a palatial mansion, was the new McDonough County Jail built in 1876. History of McDonough County 1885, pages 235-236.</dd>

   <dd>I remember the first Decoration service, May 30, 1869. The date fell on Sunday and there were some who objected to holding the service that day. It was held in the M.E. Church.

   <dd>John O.C. Wilson, born in 1804, was one of the pioneers of Macomb and served as a justice of the peace and a school commissioner. He was a humble farmer and good business man. He was the 'right kind of material for public places of honor and trust and called upon to fill many offices in the gift of the people.' He died in 1880, but this humble man judged honorably and trustworthy was chosen the first Mayor of Macomb. McDonough County History 1885, page 376.</dd>

   <dd>Local legend has it that in the early days of Macomb and McDonough County merchants would frequently refer naive young people wanting to tie the knot to the nearest postmaster saying that he was "duly government authorized." Sometimes a new postmaster would admit he didn't know all the rules and regulations but "if the merchant said he could, he supposed it was so." No official records record the matrimonial vows, but folklore says that many were pronounced "Mr. and Mrs. as provided by United States Postal regulations."

   <dd>C.V. Chandler was a prominent name in Macomb history. He was born here in 1843 and served in the Civil War. He was a bank president and business leader. One of his best known buildings was the Opera House at the southwest corner of Carroll and Lafayette. It was constructed in 1872 and served as the city's entertainment and culture center for almost fifty years. But this glittering edifice that could seat 800 and was beautifully decorated with a main floor and gallery was truly constructed on humble beginnings. The Opera House was built on the site where C.V. Chandler was raised. Images of the Past in McDonough County, Macomb Eagle - 10/19/04</dd>

   <dd>Abraham Lincoln visited Macomb, October 26, 1858. W.H. Champ, who was also born in a log cabin just south of Macomb, was there to hear Lincoln speak. It was a rainy day and the streets muddy. Everyone stood to listen because the wooden seats were too wet to use. Mr. Champ remembers Lincoln as a rapid talker who hit the nail on the head. Mr. Champ also remembers the day for another important event. It was the day he bought the first overcoat he ever owned. Macomb Daily Journal, October 26, 1914.</dd>

   <dd>In 1886 Macomb had its first fire department - the Hook and Ladder Company. The only piece of equipment was a hand drawn wagon loaded down with buckets. Those buckets could be filled with water whenever the cry of "fire" was raised. There was no fire alarm system in 1886, the members of the hook and ladder company could hear the fire cry almost anywhere in town. Remember When edition, October 6, 1993.</dd>

   <dd>In 1895 the Macomb Fire Department was charted and purchased a new chemical wagon to put out fires. Unfortunately they had no horses to draw the wagon. But they came up with an agreement with local draymen. At the cry of "Fire" the first drayman to get to the fire house and get hooked up to the hose wagon, draw it to the fire and back again would be paid. It was very competitive and often fist fights broke out among horse team owners. The princely sum for answering the fire call and supplying the horses was $5.

   <dd>Cooking in the kitchen as a Macomb pioneer woman was light years from today's microwave. In the fall and early winter, cooked pumpkin was added to dough for flavor. Venison and ham were fried and grains of corn made a frugal meal. Honey abounded in the woods. Measurements were anything but precise. The description for hoe cake says - take as much as could conveniently be held in both hands. History of McDonough County 1885, pages 73 & 74.</dd>
