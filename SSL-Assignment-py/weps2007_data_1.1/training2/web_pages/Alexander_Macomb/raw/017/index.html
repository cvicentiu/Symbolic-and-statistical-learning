      <P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=+0>Thomas Sully (1783-1872) was born in England and came to America with his family when he was ten. He received his early art instruction from an older brother and a brother-in-law, both of artistic talent, and after a formative period in Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia, he moved to New York City to enter the mainstream of his career as a portraitist. He met and received valuable guidance from Gilbert Stuart in Boston and Benjamin West in London, and his introduction to Sir Thomas Lawrence opened the way to commissions for portraits of a number of important people. He established his home base in Philadelphia, where he painted the Marquis de Lafayette among others, and reached the pinnacle of his career on a second trip to England to paint Queen Victoria. His portrait of Maj. Gen. Alexander Macomb is reproduced from the collections of the West Point Museum, United States Military Academy.</FONT>
