&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the spring and summer of 1814, military activities increased on Lake 
Champlain. On the American side, Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough and a work crew 
were building a naval fleet on Otter Creek in Vergennes, Vermont. An army of 
5000 American soldiers gathered in Plattsburgh under the command of General 
George Izard. Starting in May, the Americans began building fortifications on 
Cumberland Head and on the peninsula between Lake Champlain and the Saranac 
River south of Plattsburgh. These fortifications consisted of two blockhouses 
and three forts: Fort Scott on the lake shore, Fort Moreau (the principal fort) 
in the center, and Fort Brown on the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The British meanwhile began gathering a large army at Chambly, Quebec, just 
north of the border. This buildup, under the command of General Sir George 
Prevost, was made possible by the British victory over Napoleon in the Spanish 
peninsula. Wellington’s veterans were shipped directly to Canada. By August 
1814, approximately 16,000 had been landed. The British also began building 
ships in the Richelieu River.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The American cause very nearly suffered a disastrous blow at the end of August, 
when the War Department in Washington ordered General Izard and the major part 
of his army to Sacketts Harbor on Lake Ontario to meet what officials in 
Washington felt would be the main British attack. Brigadier General Alexander 
Macomb took command of the troops remaining in Plattsburgh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the time of all this activity, Plattsburgh was a community with 78 houses, a 
court house, four taverns, 13 stores, and 11 shops and offices, including two 
newspapers. Its industry consisted of a tannery, two saw mills, a grist mill and 
a fulling mill which produced woolen fabric. Militarily, Plattsburgh was the 
gateway to the Champlain Valley, and it contained large quantities of military 
supplies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
General Macomb developed a strategy to make the best use of his limited 
resources. He converged his whole command into a tight defense force around the 
village. To accomplish this, he abandoned the defenses on Cumberland Head and 
concentrated efforts on the three forts and two blockhouses south of the 
village. They had been placed to form an impregnable barrier across the narrow 
peninsula between the lake and the river. After manning the forts and 
blockhouses, Macomb divided up the remainder of the small army into two groups 
of 100 and 300 men. Their mission was to spy on the British and to harass the 
British advance by obstructing roads, destroying bridges and abatising the 
woods. (Abatis were barriers of felled trees.)<br>
<p align="center">The following is a day-by-day chronology of the actions leading to the Battle of 
Plattsburgh:</p><b>August 29: </b>General Izard departed for Sacketts Harbor with 4000 of his best men. 
He left 3400&nbsp;soldiers in Plattsburgh under the command of Macomb. Only 1500 were 
effective fighting men; the remainder were the remnants of departing units, the 
sick, and infantrymen serving as marines.<br><br><b>August 30:</b> British advance units crossed the border to Champlain, NY. Macomb 
urged Major General Benjamin Mooers to call out the militia. Initially Clinton 
and Essex Counties were ordered to report, with orders later extended to Warren, 
Washington and Saratoga Counties. Macomb also appealed to Vermont for militia.<br>
<br><b>September 1:</b> The British army began massing at Champlain. In subsequent days, 
the British&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
commandeered local teams and wagons and loaded them with heavy 
baggage and supplies for the march to Plattsburgh.<br><br><b>September 2:</b> The civilian exodus from Plattsburgh began. Many residents, 
including <a href="http://www.kentdelordhouse.org/Henry%20Delord.html">Henry Delord</a>, went to the Union, the Quaker settlement in Peru. 
<a href="http://www.kentdelordhouse.org/Elizabeth%20(Betsey)%20Ketchum.html">Betsey 
Delord</a> and their infant daughter <a href="http://www.kentdelordhouse.org/Frances%20Henrietta%20Delord.html">Frances Henrietta</a> had left Plattsburgh earlier 
to stay with relatives in Albany and Waterford.<br><br><b>September 3:</b> General Prevost and more than 11,000 men gathered in Champlain. 
Orders went out to all American forces to delay the British advance as much as 
possible in order to provide time for completing fortifications in Plattsburgh.<br>
<br><b>September 4:</b> Leaving a reserve and the heavy artillery in Champlain, General Prevost and an army of 8200 marched to Chazy. A group of 110 riflemen stationed 
in the Chazy area under Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Appling fell back, destroying 
bridges and abatising the route of march. They joined a group of 200 infantrymen 
under Captain John Sproull and created a fortified position at Dead Creek in the 
vicinity of what is now Plattsburgh municipal beach.<br><br>
<b>September 5:</b> The right wing of the British army marched on a route through West Chazy to an encampment about two miles north of Beekmantown Corners. The left 
wing took the State Road (today’s Route 9 North). The American forces on the 
Beekmantown Road were increased to 700 militia (from Clinton and Essex Counties) 
and 250 regulars under Major John Wool.<br>
<p align="center">THE FIGHTING BEGINS:</p><b>September 6: (</b>Beekmantown Road) A first skirmish occurred at dawn when the 
British right column met Wool’s detachment and the militia just north of Beekmantown Corners. Most of the militia fell back in great disorder and left 
the scene, but a portion stayed with Major Wool and contested the British 
advance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next engagement took place at Culver Hill, where Major Wool and some of the 
militia took a stand in short but severe fighting. At Culver Hill, Lieutenant 
Colonel James Wellington (no relation of the famous Duke) was killed in the 
fighting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Major Wool’s regulars and militia retreated to Halsey’s Corners, contesting the 
advance. There another stand was made by a force of 250 men behind a stone wall 
south of Boynton Road. About 8 a.m., as the British column advanced, the 
Americans fired their cannon and rifles, inflicting heavy damage on the head of 
the column. A second and third volley brought the British on the double with 
bayonets, causing the Americans to retreat hastily with their artillery. They 
headed to town on the main road, closely followed by the British. When the 
British army finally crossed Dead Creek, it was heavily pounded by American 
gunboats as it followed the beach road.<br>
<br>
<b>September 6: (</b>State Road (Route 9 North)) The advance of the British left column 
along the State Road was slower than that of the right column, owing to the 
swampy ground, the forests, delaying tactics of the American forces and the 
removal of the Dead Creek bridge. Because of the rapid advance of the right 
column, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Appling’s American forces withdrew from their 
position at the Dead Creek bridge. They arrived in Plattsburgh just ahead of the 
British, who emerged from the woods at what is now the intersection of 
Cumberland and Boynton Avenues. From this position, Appling’s forces fired on 
the British flanks. They then joined Major Wool’s forces and drew back through 
Plattsburgh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the American forces retreated, they crossed the Saranac River and formed 
their artillery into a battery to cover the retreat of the infantry. After all 
troops had crossed the river, General Macomb ordered the planks removed from the 
bridge (at today’s Bridge St. crossing) and formed into a breastwork to defend 
the crossing. The lower bridge was defended from the stone gristmill near its 
southern approach.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The British occupied houses near the lower bridge and fired on the Americans who 
were building fortifications. The Americans responded with hot shot, which set 
the houses on fire and forced the sharpshooters to retreat. As the British 
relocated in other buildings, the Americans continued firing hot shot. This 
process resulted in the destruction of about 15 buildings, including homes, 
stores, the courthouse and the jail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The British light artillery and baggage arrived at nightfall. The army camped on 
high ground west of the village, in an area that included the grounds now 
occupied by the CVPH Medical Center. The officers moved into the homes of 
Plattsburgh’s prominent citizens. Prevost made his headquarters in Edward 
Allen’s home on the hill west of the village (at the juncture of Broad and 
Cornelia Streets).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The losses on this day were the heaviest of the siege – about 45 Americans and 
between 200 and 300 British were killed or wounded.<br>
<br>
<b>September 7:</b> The British artillery companies began building four large batteries 
and three small batteries within range of the American forts. Shipbuilding crews 
continued to work on finishing the Confiance, the flagship of the British naval 
fleet on Lake Champlain. British soldiers built scaling ladders from horse racks 
they had gathered around the countryside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Americans continued working on their fortifications. Volunteers began 
crossing the lake from Vermont, reaching a total of 2500 by the day of the 
battle. They joined 700 New York militia who arrived to help defend Plattsburgh. 
Lieutenant Macdonough began perfecting his battle strategy, choosing a site in 
Cumberland Bay that would allow the Americans to anchor where they could use 
their short-range cannons to best advantage.<br>
<br>
<b>September 8: </b>British gun crews had their first practice on the Confiance. 
General Macomb began visiting the various groups of volunteers and militia 
arriving in Plattsburgh and issuing his battle strategy: the forces were to form 
in small separate bands rather than large groups; they were to constantly harass 
the enemy and allow him no rest; they were to pick up stragglers to get 
information about the enemy plans; and they were never to oppose a regular 
attack, but retreat as the enemy advanced and advance as he retreated; and 
especially they were to prevent crossings at the upper fords of the river.<br>
<br>
<b>September 9:</b> Americans and British continued building fortifications. Captain 
George McGlassin left his sick bed and led a group of 50 Americans on a daring 
middle-of-the-night raid on a rocket battery that the British were building at 
the bend of the Saranac River just 500 yards from Fort Brown. The noisy charge 
frightened off the work crew of 300 British soldiers, and the Americans spiked 
the British rockets and retired without the loss of a man.<br>
<br>
<b>September 10:</b> As battle preparations continued on both sides, General Macomb’s 
spies informed him of the impending attack.<br>
<br>
<b>September 11:</b> At dawn, the British fleet set sail from its anchorage off Chazy 
and arrived at Cumberland Head by 7:30 a.m. The fleet commander, Captain George 
Downie, and his officers expected General Prevost to launch his land attack at 
the first sight of the British ships. By capturing the American forts, the 
British planned to force the American fleet in between the British army and 
navy. A dying wind made it impossible for the British ships to get into the 
position they had intended. As they approached the Americans, about 8:00 a.m., 
they received heavy fire without being able to reply. At this point the British 
and American artillery began firing at each other as well. After approximately 
two hours of a pitched naval battle, the American forces emerged victorious.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On land, British troops, rather than attacking the American forts frontally, 
made their assaults at the two bridges, where they were repulsed by a determined 
American stand. More than half the British force forded the river a mile and a 
half above the upper bridge, at Pike’s Cantonment. The American militia was 
unable to hold back this massive assault. Instead, they withdrew and attacked 
the British with snipers on all sides.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, in the late morning, the British army commander learned of the 
victory of the American naval fleet (the Confiance had surrendered at 11 a.m.), 
and General Prevost gave an order to retreat. Although the artillery bombardments 
continued, the British forces began heading north. 
<p>&nbsp;<b>September 12:</b> By 2 a.m., 
the entire British army was in full retreat to Canada.<br>
The totally unexpected American victory had&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">
thwarted British attempts for controlling</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
</font>Lake Champlain and annexing portions of the northeastern United States. This 
victory led to the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in Belgium, by the United 
States and Great Britain, which ended the War of 1812 on Christmas Eve, 1814.</p>
