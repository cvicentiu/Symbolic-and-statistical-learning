<p><font size="4">The British replaced the French in control of Detroit in 1780 
  and renamed the military outpost, Fort Lernoult. But there were few British 
  troops or settlers in the area. A few English and American entrepreneurs joined 
  French colleagues as merchants and traders. The most successful trades arms 
  and supplies to the Indians for furs that were then sold to dealers in Montreal. 
  The Macomb family became one of the most successful trading families in the 
  Detroit area. At one point in the late 18th century, they apparently held title 
  to almost all of Macomb County, Belle Isle and Grosse Isle. Alexander Macomb 
  was born into this family in 1782 but opted for a military career. He distinguished 
  himself in the War of 1812 when he led US forces against the British in a battle 
  at Plattsburgh, New York. </font></p>
<p><font size="4"> This statue commemorates one of Detroit's hero in the second 
  war against the British. The sculptor, Adolph Alexander Weinman, used granite 
  and bronze to portray Macomb as a decisive, competent and dominating officer. 
  Note the stern face and firm jaw that we expect in a military leader who is 
  about to take his troops into battle.<br>
  Weinman also executed the William Maybury memorial in Grand Circus Park.</font></p>
