        <p align="left"><b><font size="5">SIR-</font>I have the honor to
        communicate, for the information of the war department, the particulars
        of the advance of the enemy into the territory of the U. States, the
        circumstances attending the siege of Plattsburgh, and the defence of the
        posts entrusted to my charge.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">T</font>he Governor-General of the
        Canadas, Sir George Prevost, having collected all the disposable force
        of Lower Canada, with a view of conquering the country as far as
        Crown-point, and Ticonderoga, entered the territory of the U. States, on
        the first of the month, and occupied the village of Champlain- there
        avowed his intentions, and issued orders and proclamations, tending to
        dissuade the people from their allegiance, and inviting them to furnish
        his army with provisions. He immediately began to impress the waggons,
        and teams, in the vicinity, and loaded them with his heavy baggage and
        stores; from this, I was persuaded he intended to attack this place. I
        had but just returned from the lines, where I had commanded a fine
        brigade, which was broken up to form the division of Maj. Gen. Izard,
        ordered to the westward. Being senior officer, he left me in command;
        and, except the four companies of the 6th regiment, I had not an
        organized battalion among those remaining; the garrison was composed of
        convalescents, and the recruits of the new regiments- all in the
        greatest confusion, as well as the ordnance and stores, and the works in
        no state of defence. To create an emulation and zeal, among the officers
        and men, in completing the works, I divided them into detachments, and
        placed them near the several forts- declaring, in orders, that each
        detachment was the garrison of its own works, and bound to defend it to
        the last extremity.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">T</font>he enemy advanced cautiously,
        and by short marches, and our soldiers worked day and night; so that, by
        the time he made his appearance before the place, we were prepared to
        receive him.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">G</font>en. Izard renamed the
        principal work Fort Moreau; and, to remind the troops of the actions of
        their brave countrymen, I called the redoubt, on the right, fort Brown;
        and that on the left, fort Scott; besides these three works, we have two
        block-houses, strongly fortified.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">F</font>inding, on examining the
        returns of the garrison, that our force did not exceed fifteen hundred
        men for duty; and well informed that the enemy had as many thousand; I
        called on Gen. Mooers, of the New-York militia, and arranged with him,
        plans for bringing forth the militia, <i>en masse</i>. The inhabitants
        of the village fled, with their families and effects, except a few
        worthy citizens, and some boys, who formed themselves into a party,
        received rifles, and were exceedingly useful.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">B</font>y the 4th of the month, Gen.
        Mooers collected about 700 militia, and advanced 7 miles on the Beekman
        Town road, to watch the motions of the enemy, and to skirmish with him
        as he advanced- also, to obstruct the roads with fallen trees, and to
        break up the bridges. On the lake road, at Dead-creek bridge, I posted
        200 men, under Capt. Sproul, of the 13th regiment, with orders to
        abattis the woods, to place obstruction in the road, and to fortify
        himself; to this party I added two field pieces. In advance of that
        position, was Lieut. Col. Appling, with 110 riflemen, watching the
        movements of the enemy, and procuring intelligence. It was ascertained
        that, before daylight on the 6th, the enemy would advance in two
        columns, on the two roads before mentioned, dividing at Sampson's, a
        little below Chazy village. The column, on the Beekman Town road,
        proceeded most rapidly; the militia skirmished with their advanced
        parties, and, except a few brave men, fell back most precipitately in
        the greatest disorder, notwithstanding the British troops did not deign
        to fire upon them, except by their flankers and advanced patroles. The
        night previous, I ordered Major Wool to advance, with a detachment of
        250 men, to support the militia, and set them an example of firmness;
        also Captain Leonard, of the light artillery, was directed to proceed
        with two pieces, to be on the ground before day- yet he did not make his
        appearance until 8 o'clock, when the enemy had approached within two
        miles of the village; with his conduct, therefore, I am not well
        pleased. Major Wool, with his party, disputed the road with great
        obstinacy, but the militia could not be prevailed on to stand,
        notwithstanding the exertions of the General, and staff officers,
        although the fields were divided by strong stone walls, and they were
        told that the enemy could not possibly cut them off. The state dragoons,
        of New-York, wear red coats; and, they being on the heights to watch the
        enemy, and fearing his getting in their rear. Finding the enemy's
        columns had penetrated within a mile of Plattsburgh, I dispatched my
        aid-de-camp, Lieut. Root, to bring off the detachment at Dead-creek, and
        to inform Lieut. Col. Appling that I wished him to fall on the enemy's
        right flank; the Colonel fortunately arrived just in time to save his
        retreat, and to fall in with the head of a column debouching from the
        woods; here he poured in a destructive fire from his riflemen at rest,
        and continued to annoy the column until he formed a junction with Major
        Wool. The field pieces did considerable execution among the enemy's
        columns.&nbsp;So undaunted, however, was the enemy, that he never
        deployed in his whole march, always pressing on in column. Finding that
        every road was full of troops, crowding on us on all sides, I ordered
        the field pieces to retire across the bridge, and form a battery for its
        protection, and to cover the retreat of the infantry, which was
        accordingly done, and the parties of Appling and Wool, as well as Sproul,
        retired alternately, keeping up a brisk fire, until they got under cover
        of the works.&nbsp; The enemy's light troops occupied the houses near
        the bridge, and kept up a constant firing from the windows and
        balconies, and annoyed us much- I ordered them to be driven out with hot
        shot, which soon put the houses in flames, and obliged these
        sharp-shooters to retire. The whole day, until it was too late to see,
        the enemy's light troops endeavored to drive our guards from the bridge;
        but they suffered dearly for their perseverance. An attempt was also
        made to cross the upper bridge, where the militia handsomely drove them
        back.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">T</font>he column which marched by the
        lake road, was much impeded by obstructions, and the removal of the
        bridge at Dead-creek; and, as it passed the creek and beach, the gallies
        kept up a lively and galling fire.&nbsp;</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">O</font>ur troops being now all on the
        south side of the Saranac, I directed the planks to be taken off the
        bridges, and piled up in the form of breast-works, to cover our parties
        intended for disputing the passage, which afterwards enabled us to hold
        the bridges against very superior numbers. From the 7th to the 11th, the
        enemy was employed in getting his battering train, and erecting his
        batteries and approaches, and constantly skirmishing at the bridges and
        fords. By this time, the militia of New-York, and volunteers from
        Vermont, were pouring in from all quarters. I advised Gen. Mooers to
        keep his force along the Saranac, to prevent the enemy crossing the
        river, and to send a strong body in his rear, to harass him day and
        night, and keep him in continual alarm. The militia behaved with great
        spirit after the first day, and the volunteers from Vermont were
        exceedingly serviceable. Our regular troops, notwithstanding the
        constant skirmishing, and repeated endeavors of the enemy to cross the
        river, kept at their work, day and night, strengthening their defences,
        and evinced a determination to hold out to the last extremity.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">I</font>t was reported that the enemy
        only awaited the arrival of his flotilla, to make a general attack.
        About 8, on the morning of the 11th, as was expected, the flotilla
        appeared in sight, round Cumberland Head, and at 9, bore down and
        engaged our flotilla, at anchor, in the bay, off this town. At the same
        instant, the batteries were opened on us, and continued throwing
        bomb-shells, shrapnells, balls, and Congreve rockets, until sun-set,
        when the bombardment ceased; every battery of the enemy being silenced
        by the superiority of our fire. The naval engagement lasted 2 hours, in
        full view of both armies; three efforts were made, by the enemy, to pass
        the river at the commencement of the cannonade and bombardment, with a
        view of assaulting the works, and had prepared for that purpose an
        immense number of scaling ladders; one attempt was made to cross at the
        village bridge; another at the upper bridge; and a third, at a ford,
        about three miles from the works;- at the first two he was repulsed by
        the regulars, at the ford, by the brave volunteers and militia- where he
        suffered severely in killed, wounded, and prisoners, a considerable body
        having passed the stream, but were either killed, taken, or driven
        back.- The woods, at this place, were very favorable to the operations
        of our militia; a whole company of the 76th regiment was here destroyed-
        the three Lieutenants, and 27 men, prisoners; the Captain, and the rest,
        killed.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">I</font> cannot forego the pleasure of
        here stating the gallant conduct of Captain McGlassin, of the 15th
        regiment, who was ordered to ford the river, and attack a party constructing
        a battery on the right of the enemy's line, within 500 yards of fort
        Brown- which he handsomely executed, at midnight, with 50 men; drove off
        the working party, consisting of 150, and defeated a covering party, of
        the same number- killing one officer, and 6 men, in the charge, and
        wounding many. At dusk, the enemy withdrew his artillery from the
        batteries, and raised the siege; and, at 9, under the cover of the
        night, sent off all the heavy baggage he could find transport for, and
        also his artillery- at 2, the next morning, the whole army precipitately
        retreated, leaving the sick and wounded to our generosity, and the
        Governor left a note with a surgeon, requesting the humane attention of
        the commanding General. Vast quantities of provision were left behind,
        and destroyed; also, an immense quantity of bomb-shells, cannon balls,
        grape shot, ammunition, flints, &amp;c. &amp;c.; intrenching tools of
        all sorts, also tents, and marquees. A great quantity has been found in
        the ponds and creeks, and buried in the ground- and a vast quantity
        carried off by the inhabitants. Such was the precipitance of his
        retreat, that he arrived in Chazy, a distance of 8 miles, before we had
        discovered he had gone. The light troops, volunteers, and militia,
        pursued immediately, on learning his flight; and some of the mounted men
        made prisoners 5 dragoons, of the 19th, and several others of the rear
        guard. A continued fall of rain, and a violent storm, prevented further
        pursuit. Upwards of 300 deserters have come in, and many are hourly
        arriving.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="6">T</font>he conduct of the officers,
        non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, of my command, during this
        trying occasion, cannot be represented in too high terms; and I feel it
        my duty to recommend, to the particular notice of government, Lieut.
        Col. Appling, of the 1st rifle corps; Major Wool, of the 29th; Major
        Totten, of the corps of engineers; Captain Brooks, of the artillery;
        Captain McGlassin, of the 15th; Lieutenants De Russy and Trescott, of
        the corps of engineers; Lieutenants Smyth, Mountford, and Cromwell, of
        the artillery; also, my aid, Lieut. Root, who have all distinguished themselves,
        by their uncommon zeal and activity, and have been greatly instrumental
