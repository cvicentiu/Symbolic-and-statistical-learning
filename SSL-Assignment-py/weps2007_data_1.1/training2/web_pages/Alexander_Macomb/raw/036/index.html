  <P class="story">The Macomb County Historical Commission has a full agenda for 2006:</P>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="story">A Grant-Writing Workshop was conducted by Dr. Holley of Wayne State University and held at the Chesterfield Public Library on February 11th. Many historical groups in the county sent representatives. This was done in response to a survey conducted at the Heritage meeting in April 2005. </li>
    <li class="story">The theme for the Commission&rsquo;s historical coloring book this year is transportation. There are still a few left from 2005, contact the Historical Commission if you are interested in a copy. </li>
    <li class="story">Congratulations to Betty Jane Wogen, esteemed local historian, who was the 2nd winner of the Alexander Macomb Award for History. Betty Jane was the winner for 2005; the winner for 2006 will be announced at the 2006 Bath City Festival held every year in Mt. Clemens in the last weekend of August. </li>
    <li class="story">The chairman of the historical commission, Karl Mark Pall, as well as other members, have worked in securing a greater role for Macomb County in the Heritage History Corridor, as well as the Local History Conference for Michigan, held each year in different locations. A meeting/symposium was held on March 24th at Macomb County Community College at which many commission members were on a roundtable discussion regarding the role of Macomb County in the history of the auto industry. </li>
    <li class="story">The vice-chairman, Don Green, received commendations from Macomb Co. Commission chairman Nancy White for his 80th birthday. Don also spearheaded the restoration of the commemorative cannons in downtown Mt. Clemens that were originally lost to World War II scrap metal drives. He is continuing to spearhead the move for a plaque and other commemoratives for the Macomb Co. Poor Farm site. </li>
    <li class="story">The commission is continuing to keep this website updated with new local history spotlights, updated information for the individual historical groups, guides to researching local history, as well as adding a section for &ldquo;Upcoming Local Events.&rdquo; </li>
  </ul>
    <ul><li class="story">Camille Silda and Marian Lynch of the commission are continuing their extensive survey of historical buildings of the county. </li>
    <li class="story">The new coloring book for the historical commission was a great success and very popular! With its subject as auto transportation, copies of the coloring book can be obtained by contacting the historical commission.</li>
    <li class="story">The Macomb County Historical Commission will continue to maintain a presence at many local historical events besides those directly spearheaded by the commission. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="story">For any additions, updates, or corrections of the material in the historical commission&rsquo;s pages, please contact <a href="mailto:macombhistory@yahoo.com">macombhistory@yahoo.com</a>. We are still looking for original stories detailing specifics on the history of Macomb County to post as Local History Spotlights. We appreciate your timely entries to our Upcoming Local Events page.
