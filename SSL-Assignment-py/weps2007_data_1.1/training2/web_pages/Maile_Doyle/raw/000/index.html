And that frightened people, Doyle said. <P>  Clymer wanted to impose the tax increase, Oman wanted to put it before the voters, and Spahr didn't seem to know which was the best plan, Doyle said. <P>  "It was a very scary time for a lot of people to think that deputies would have to be laid off, that they would not be safe," Doyle said. "All I could see from my perspective, from the outside looking in, was that the commissioners were not united in the common goal of keeping the people safe." <P>  Things should never have gotten that bad in the first place, she said. Somebody should have seen the revenue shortfall coming, back when the economy started to take a nosedive in September 2001, and taken steps to soften the blow to the county's wallet, she said. <P>  "It was not unforeseeable, maybe unpredictable but not unforeseeable," she said. <P>  Leaders of the public, private and nonprofit sectors of the community also need to come together to tackle what she calls "under employment" -- when local salaries aren't high enough to cover the cost of living. <P>  A key element in tackling the problem is to encourage developers to build more affordable housing in the area, she said. <P>  "I would like the people who work in Hancock County to be able to live in Hancock County," she said. <P>  A self-described "Army brat," Doyle was born on a military installation in Hawaii and grew up in places like Vietnam, South Korea and Germany. <P>  Doyle first came to Findlay when her husband's job with Marathon brought them here for a year in 1981. They were then relocated to Wyoming and Texas before coming back in 1990. <P>  She is the director of United Way of Hancock County Volunteer Center, chairwoman of the Ohio Community Service Council, and co-chairs the University of Findlay Campus Compact Board -- which oversees volunteer programs for university students and staff looking to get involved in the community. <P>  Doyle has a bachelor's degree in business administration from Bowling Green State University and was recognized for her accomplishments in October by the Findlay-Hancock County Business and Professional Women/USA association. <P>  She ran for Findlay mayor this year in the Republican primary election, finishing second to Tony Iriti. <P>  Now she is the fifth Republican to file for Clymer's county commissioner position. She will be competing in March with Roger Bower, John Motter, Bob Nichols and Emily Walton. <P>  The filing deadline is Jan. 2 for candidates who want to appear on the March 2 primary election ballot. <P>  Independent candidates for commissioner have until March 1 to file candidacy petitions.<P>----------<P> <P>Contact staff writer John Graber at:<P>(419) 427-8417<P>johngraber@thecourier.com<P><!--FM--><P><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="2"COLOR="silver"><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.thecourier.com/forum/forum.asp" target="_blank"><B><I>Comments?</A><BR><A HREF="#Top">Back To Headlines</I></B></font></A></CENTER></TD></TABLE><P><HR><P><TABLE BGCOLOR="#FEFEE2" CELLPADDING="5" border="1" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" bordercolorlight="#C0C0C0" bordercolordark="#C0C0C0"><TD><A NAME="story3"><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="+2"COLOR="#708090"><CENTER><B><!--Head-->Oman seeks 3rd term, cites economic growth </font></B><BR><B><!--By-->By JOHN GRABER<BR><!--FM-->STAFF WRITER</B></CENTER><P><!--Text--> The quality of life its residents enjoy makes Hancock County "the shining star of northwest Ohio," according to County Commissioner Stephen Oman. <P>  The county's tax and unemployment rates are among the lowest in the state, and Oman wants to be around to make sure they stay that way. <P>  That is why he's running for re-election in the Republican primary this March. <P>  He wants Hancock County to continue being "a great place to live, work and raise a family in," said the 54-year-old career farmer who was born and raised in Eagle Township. <P>  Hancock County tied Madison County last month for the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the state at 3.8 percent. The county's sales tax rate, meanwhile, weighs in at just three-quarters of a percent. <P>  That's no coincidence, Oman said. <P>  After talking to business representatives who are interested in moving to the area, Oman said he immediately contacts township trustees and school officials to get everyone on the same page. <P>  "You have to have jobs," he said. "You have to have good jobs." <P>  And he says he has worked hard to bring them here by creating enterprise zones and working to extend infrastructure like water and sewer lines to new and existing businesses. <P>  Working with Bluffton's Tower Automotive to secure a new product line for the plant brought a $7 million facility and 30 new jobs to Hancock County last year -- a perfect case in point, he said. <P>  "You've got to continue to grow ... your local economy," he said. "If you don't, you start going backwards and if you go backwards, that means higher taxes." <P>  The county's Job and Family Services Department is also a big part of enticing and keeping jobs here, by training a "world class work force," he said. <P>  But not all infrastructure expansions in the county are tied to economic interests, he added. A waterline installment from the city of Findlay to Van Buren greatly improved the quality of life in the village, Oman said. <P>  He admits a $1.5 million shortfall this year has put the county's finances on thin ice. <P>  "Whoever thought investment revenue would drop from $1.3 million-plus to $300,000?" he said. <P>  However, he feels things are turning around. <P>  A quarter-percent sales tax increase approved by voters in May is expected to raise about $2.5 million annually for two years. That money is strictly earmarked for departments in the county's criminal justice system, but it will ultimately ease the overall burden on the general fund, making it possible to build up a cash surplus to tide the county over until the economy picks up, he figures. <P>  "You've got to feel good about how we came out of this and how we look today," Oman said. <P>  He is also proud of the county's new Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Agricultural Service Center buildings on County Road 140. The county fronted the money for the buildings, but it is being paid back in rent by the agencies occupying them. Oman figures rent from the ag center actually nets the county about $40,000 after the annual debt payment is made, and he hopes for a similar situation with the BMV building. <P>  Many of the other candidates running for the commissioners' office have criticized the apparent lack of cooperation and communication that the board has with other elected officials, but Oman said they are simply trying to create "political buzzwords" to bolster their campaigns. <P>  "If there is a strength I do bring to the commissioners, I think it's the ability to bring people together," he said. <P>  Oman, who is in his second term as a commissioner, is currently facing Ed Ingold and Charlie Fisher in the GOP primary race for his seat. <P>  The filing deadline is Jan. 2 for candidates who want to appear on the March 2 primary election ballot. <P>  Independent candidates for commissioner have until March 1 to file candidacy petitions.<P>----------<P> <P>Contact staff writer John Graber at:<P>(419) 427-8417<P>johngraber@thecourier.com<P><!--FM--><P><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="2"COLOR="silver"><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.thecourier.com/forum/forum.asp" target="_blank"><B><I>Comments?</A><BR><A HREF="#Top">Back To Headlines</I></B></font></A></CENTER></TD></TABLE><P><HR><P><TABLE BGCOLOR="#FEFEE2" CELLPADDING="5" border="1" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" bordercolorlight="#C0C0C0" bordercolordark="#C0C0C0"><TD><A NAME="story4"><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="+2"COLOR="#708090"><CENTER><B><!--Head-->Tree recycling possible at six county locations</font></B><BR><B><BR></B></CENTER><P><!--Text--> Hancock County residents can dispose of their live Christmas trees, which will be recycled, at six locations around the county. <P>  The locations where trees can be dropped off, and telephone numbers, include: <P>  • Kaleidoscope Farms, County Road 54, Mount Cory, (419) 859-3378. <P>  • Homestead Country Store, 6850 Township Road 258, Alvada, (419) 894-6765. <P>  • Hancock County Sanitary Landfill, 10400 Allen Township Road 107, (419) 299-3638. <P>  • Brinkman's Turkey Farm, 16314 U.S. 68, (419) 365-5127. <P>  • Liberty Township House, corner of County Road 140 and Township Road 89, Findlay. <P>  • City of Findlay Reservoir, Marina Parking Lot, Marion Township Road 207. <P>  Live Christmas trees can be dropped off through Sunday, Jan. 18 at these locations. <P>  All decorations, ornaments, tinsel and plastic bags must be removed from the trees before they are left for recycling. <P>  The recycled trees will be used for a number of conservation practices, such as wood chips/mulch for landscaping, wildlife habitat, and in ponds for fish management. <P>  Further information about the recycling effort is available from the Hancock County Commissioners Special Projects Office at (419) 424-7210.<P><P><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="2"COLOR="silver"><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.thecourier.com/forum/forum.asp" target="_blank"><B><I>Comments?</A><BR><A HREF="#Top">Back To Headlines</I></B></font></A></CENTER></TD></TABLE><P><HR><P><TABLE BGCOLOR="#FEFEE2" CELLPADDING="5" border="1" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" bordercolorlight="#C0C0C0" bordercolordark="#C0C0C0"><TD><A NAME="story5"><FONT FACE="Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica" Size="+2"COLOR="#708090"><CENTER><B><!--Head-->Public Record</font></B><BR><B><BR></B></CENTER><P><!--Text--><!--Head-->Docket<P><!--FM--> The following incidents were reported to the Findlay Police Department and the Hancock County Sheriff's Office:<P>Police Department<P> A city resident said Thursday she was assaulted by her roommate at 1819 Park St. <P>  A man wanted on an active Wood County warrant was taken into custody for resisting arrest Friday, after police were summoned to a domestic dispute at a Fox Run Road residence.
