          Findlay and Hancock County residents find out more about what is going 
          on in the community. Organizations like the United Way, Arts Partnership 
          and Hancock Park District keep viewers up to date about the activities 
          everyone can be a part of. Debuting in the spring of 2002 as a monthly, 
          this season we will bring viewers a bi-monthly show to keep events more 
          fresh in everyone&#8217;s mind.</font>

              of the Volunteer Center, United Way of Hancock County since April 
              1996. Before joining the United Way, she was the Managing Partner 
              for KIDS II, a children's resale business in Findlay. <br>
              <br>
              One of seven children, Maile is an &#8220;Army brat&quot; raised 
              all over the world. She has lived in Panama, Vietnam, South Korea 
              and Germany, as well as many places in the United States. Her husband, 
              Bill Doyle&#8217;s job with Marathon Oil Company brought her back 
              to Findlay in September of 1990. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">She began her lifelong commitment to volunteerism 
              at the age of 14 when her parents encouraged her to help at a Vietnamese 
              orphanage with babies desperately in need of human contact. The 
              experience hooked her on the truly wonderful feeling derived from 
              helping another human being. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">She is married, the mother of two and the grandmother
