            </strong></em>While I admit that having the Volunteer Center as part 
            of the United Way has its drawbacks, I really wonder how an organization 
            like that would be funded otherwise, especially long term. Perhaps 
            the partnership with volunteering and the United Way is better than 
            nothing? My organization has received good services from our local 
            Volunteer Center, but we are a United Way agency. I am interested 
            to hear comments from non-United Way organizations to see how they 
            are fairing. </p>

            Here, Here!!!! Having been employed by two Volunteer Centers during 
            my career, I wholeheartedly agree that absorbing a center into the 
            United Way turns the focus away from what a volunteer center should 
            be - a full service community resource serving all not-for-profit 
            agencies with the freedom to explore issues and legislation that effect 
            volunteerism regionally and statewide. In my community - Tulsa, Oklahoma, 
            we have a seriously understaffed but amazingly effective Volunteer 
            Center. Tulsa's Volunteer Center is a program of our Community Service 
            Council and serves more than 400 non-profits while our United Way 
            funds about 75 agencies. Community Service Councils are probably better 
            resting places for volunteer centers than United Ways - if a community 
            cannot afford a free standing center. Any other Community Service 
            Councils house a volunteer center? </p>

            </strong></em>I live in the Philadelphia area and was not aware that 
            the United Way quietly dissolved the Volunteer Center. I used this 
            center and it proved helpful for my non-profit organization. This 
            was a great resource that people could turn to when they wanted to 
            know where they could volunteer. The center had info on lots of non-profits 
            that people could find out about. Now where do people go? The United 
            Way has been realigning itself but it seems to have gone in a wrong 
            direction. Bring back the Volunteer Center!</p>

            You sure know where to find the hot topics. I've just finished reading 
            today's United Way/Volunteer Center hot topic and found we finally 
            agree somewhere!</p>
          <p> A sponsored Volunteer Center was my experience. When the parent 
            company was in annual appeal mode or needed volunteers recruited, 
            the &quot;in house&quot; VC was expected to drop their own clients 
            and give priority to the new parent company challenge. The parent 
            company rarely if ever inquired about the VC's own clientele.</p>
          <p>VC clients were often expected to be pushed aside for sponsorship 
            projects and employees and volunteer support staff were left confused 
            and overwhelmed by additional work. Did we serve our own clients, 
            would we appear indifferent to the sponsors needs? All further complicated 
            by being an office of 2 with a support staff of 6 housed under the 
            same roof as our parent company.</p>
          <p> Management didn't want to address time management concerns often 
            enough to impact this cycle from reoccurring. VC clients were disappointed, 
            time lines on volunteer need would run out unfulfilled and staff was 
            left to work on projects thrust at them.</p>
          <p>Conflicts of interest would develop down the road as well. Once an 
            individual volunteered for the parent company they were almost perceived 
            as &quot;their volunteer&quot; from that point on. They were offered 
            new, more detailed fundraising committees, board membership, and most 
            certainly placed on the sponsors own mailing list.</p>
          <p>It wasn't easy to have a concise proactive debate on how and why 
            this hot topic is real and often the beginning and end all of a Volunteer 
            Center's independence.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Submitted on 4Dec02 by Laura J. Brown, Director of Volunteer 
            Resources, American Red Cross Washtenaw County Chapter, Michigan<br>
            </em></strong>My local area has no volunteer center. We had one once, 
            it was part of the United Way and it was downsized out of existence. 
            The downsizing occurred in response to some problems our United Way 
            had and they had to downsize to show the community that they were 
            fiscally responsible. The Volunteer resources are always the first 
            to go since they don&#8217;t raise money. It is a huge lack in our 
            community that many people are unaware of because it has been so long 
            since there was a volunteer center. </p>
          <p>My biggest trigger in your article was the Day of Caring. I also 
            dislike the focus on large group volunteering. It is a great way to 
            get to know an agency, but it is so expensive for small agencies to 
            buy the materials and try to supervise a group that may be 3 times 
            the size of it&#8217;s existing staff. I have had fabulous Day of 
            Caring experiences at my current agency (the American Red Cross) but 
            I have also had some Day of Caring events that have felt like something 
            other than a day caring!</p>

            </strong></em>This is interesting. We are trying to start a Volunteer 
            Center and 211 information center in our area. The United Way is involved 
            in the start up. Although I expect the Canadian United Ways are different, 
            Susan's point about Volunteer Centers serving a larger group than 
            what falls under the United Way's umbrella is interesting and food 
            for thought as we go forward looking for a &quot;home&quot; for our 
            volunteer Center.</p>

            Executive &amp; CEO - Palmetto Council, BSA, Spartanburg, SC<br>
            </em></strong>Having worked in the non-profit sector for the past 
            26 years in five different southern states I have personally seen 
            all sorts of &quot;volunteer center&quot; arrangements from free-standing 
            independent organizations to those funded by a local United Way to 
            those being housed in a local United Way to those being part of a 
            local United Way to none at all. To me the best arrangement is to 
            have &quot;none at all&quot; with the onus on volunteer recruitment, 
            training, placement, guidance, and direction being placed on the actual 
            agency where the volunteer works. This arrangement places the responsibility 
            directly in line with the benefit received. Should there be any struggle 
            for dollars or control it then becomes all intra-agency and resolution 
            to the concern becomes the local board's responsibility for action.</p>

            </em></strong>I have wondered why the Volunteer Center of the Capital

            from sight.. now I know why. Thanks for the enlightening article. 
            I plan to show it to our County Executive.</p>

            </em></strong>You've made lots of good points. I have to say that 
            I agree with you. I think the United Way does an excellent job in 
            many communities, but if a Volunteer Center is a part of the United 
            Way it will definitely be limited in scope. And volunteerism is certainly 
            a lot broader than the United Way. </p>
          <p><strong><em>Submitted on 4Dec02 by Aaron Spevacek, Executive Director, 
            Alexandria Volunteer Bureau VA/USA<br>
            </em></strong>I think that my organization might be a good example 
            of the ideal relationship between a volunteer center and local United 
            Way. We are an independent center that was started by the United Way. 
            The United Way&#8217;s support was very important when we were just 
            getting off the ground. But since that time (20+ years ago), we have 
            grown well beyond our initial role as a volunteer clearinghouse. And 
            now that the regional United Way has gotten its self into serious 
            trouble, with many layoffs expected, we are out of the fray. </p>
          <p>Incidentally, I believe very much in the role our United Way plays 
            in facilitating workplace campaigns and in doing community needs assessments. 
            I make a point of supporting their efforts in both regards. </p>

            As a VC internal to a United Way, I have to disagree with most of 
            the statements made, although I can see where many of them originate. 
            Our VC merged with the United Way in 1995, and has been undervalued 
            for much of the time since then. However, times are changing, and 
            we are now receiving more internal attention than ever before. In 
            the face of increased competition for donor dollars, our United Way 
            is positioning the Volunteer Center as one of the things that makes 
            us more than JUST a fund raiser. As the Volunteer Center, we serve 
            any not-for-profit, including governmental, environmental, animal, 
            arts, and other non-health and human service organizations. We have 
            overcome the competition for campaign dollars by researching the other 
            ways in which companies give--many of them have grant programs that 
            go over and above their corporate gifts and United Way giving programs. 
            We form better relationships with the donors (both individuals and 
            companies as a whole) by serving them in another capacity--through 
            volunteerism opportunities. Days of Caring has been an excellent vehicle 
            to get companies involved throughout the rest of the year, because 
            of their fantastic DOC experiences. We also have the advantage of 
            other UW staff assisting the VC--communications and marketing, campaign 
            connections to businesses, HR, etc. And even if the VC is being &quot;used&quot; 
            by the United Way organization to increase campaign dollars, so what? 
            It only benefits the VC in the end--through the exposure and the piece 
            of the pie that we get, as well.</p>

            United Way of Pierce County, Tacoma, WA</strong></em><br>
            This was a very good analysis of how Volunteer Centers USED TO BE 
            viewed by United Ways. Unfortunately, the article is about 5 years 
            out of date.</p>
          <p>Most United Ways in America are moving to a model with &quot;community 
            impact&quot; as their core business. Money is a key strategy, but 
            it's not the mission. Volunteering is a rapidly progressing key strategy 
            as well, and many United Ways are paying MUCH MORE attention to this 
            issue, not less attention.</p>
          <p>Campaigns are moving to a &quot;community conversations&quot; model 
            rather than a &quot;thermometer&quot; model...discussions are about 
            human needs, and how people can help....including &quot;here's how 
            you can volunteer.&quot; Many thousands are now hearing this message. 
            When leveraged this way, United Way may in fact be the BEST place 
            to house a community Volunteer Opportunities Center.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Submitted on 4Dec02 by Jackie Norris, Executive Director, 
            Metro Volunteers, Denver, CO USA</em></strong><br>
            In Denver, our United Way &quot;spun off&quot; the volunteer center 
            over 8 years ago (during a difficult financial time for UW), and merged 
            it with a technical assistance nonprofit, to form Metro Volunteers.They 
            have been our largest funder ever since, and their CEO has been a 
            board member of the volunteer center--and he really understand the 
            value and impact an effective volunteer center can have. </p>
          <p>We've been able to grow very differently than we would have if we 
            were still internal...but we have the best of both worlds. We actually 
            rent space in the United Way building, and they give us great support. 
            We are in the process of building a closer programmatic relationship 
            with them as they launch their 211 effort.</p>
          <p> I join you in being outraged at the closing of the Philadelphia 
            Center--and I wish folks in local communities would do more to support 
            our type of organization, but the problem is often that we are a well 
            kept secret and don't do an effective job of telling our story or 
            showing our impact. We exist today because a group of local volunteer 
            managers and other supporters didn't want the volunteer center to 
            go away, and put some energy and effort into finding us a new home.

            Volunteer Center of RI, Providence, RI</em></strong><br>
            I'm from an independent center which at one time was part of United 
            Way, then spun off as the organization focused more on fundraising. 
            The pluses are as Susan indicated, in that we are able to focus on 
            helping many organizations find volunteers (rather than focusing only 
            on UW agencies) and aren't impeded by the fundraising calendar from 
            doing our duties. On the other hand, we have found ourselves in competition 
            with UW as they handled Dare To Care (episodic volunteering) in house 
            and turned it into a campaign long activity. Also, UW is well known 
            and branded in our community, but a much smaller percentage recognizes 
            the Volunteer Center exists. This, in turn, makes it difficult for 
            us to raise the funds necessary to grow the Center and truly impact 
            outcomes in our community.</p>
          <p> UWA and many local UW's are embracing a new mission statement, which 
            eerily echoes the mission of the Points of Light Foundation and Volunteer 
            Center National Network, and talks about mobilizing the caring capacity 
            of people. UWA is also promoting Volunteer Solutions, which is an 
            online volunteer matching tool. It seems to me that perhaps the pendulum 
            is swinging the other way, and that UW is recognizing the need for 
            supporting volunteerism locally. After all, several studies have shown 
            that people who volunteer are much more likely to make donations, 
            and significant ones at that!</p>
          <p> An editorial aside, what really burns me up is the comment I hear 
            from funders in general that say &quot;Of course we see the value 
            of volunteerism&quot; and then continue to cut funds for just this 
            issue!!!</p>

            </em></strong>A number of good points, however many United Ways are 
            changing as have many Volunteer Centers in order to make more of a 
            sustained impact within communities. If a United Way sees its mission 
            as mobilizing the caring power of the community to improve the lives 
            of people in need (as is United Way of RI's), it must work cooperatively 
            with an independent Volunteer Center if it exists or have some capacity 
            to identify, recruit, train, orient, support volunteers and volunteerism 
            in order to have maximum impact. In our United Way of RI's transformation 
            to even more intentionally mobilize RI's community, our commitment 
            is to work together with our Volunteer Center to help it be as strong 
            and wide-present as possible. This is why we also are helping to fund 
            its acquisition of new software to help it function the way it wants 
            to which is more effective and more able to identify outcomes which 
            will also help it attract more funding. This is a healthy partnership.<br>
            <br>
            Excellent point to bring up for discussion because I have seen a number 
            of United Ways which are not working well with Volunteer Centers, 
            have incorporated &amp; killed them, or ended up solely focusing on 
            recruiting people for 1 shot events. </p>

            </strong></em>I could not disagree with you more on your impression 
            of the marriage between United Ways and Volunteer Centers. First, 
            you're looking at an old UW model - UW today do not fund agencies 
            but rather programs. We are know longer dependent on corporate campaigns, 
            but most our our funding comes from grants, parts of which are retained 
            by the UWVC to support the volunteer work needed to make the program 
            successful. </p>
          <p>Days of Caring - gone - large groups - corporate or others volunteer 
            year round and we match them to the needs of the community at dates 
            and times convenient to them and the agency. Lost identity - not a 
            chance - the VC is known as the VC - perhaps because our UW has several 
            different programs as part of its work - we look more independent. 
            The major advantage - a preexisting stand alone VC just couldn't raise 
            the dollars necessary to support itself. But by including the recruitment, 
            training, recognition, of volunteers into a broader grant proposal 
            e.g. a program focused on serving youth - we collaborate with a number 
            of agencies and all share in the funding - including monies for the 
            VC part of the project. Sure, a VC internal to the UW has a different 
            focus - we don't create volunteer driven programs just to support 
            the work of a VC - but provide a critical resource to a number of 
            agencies that rely on volunteers - we offer training for boards and 
            staff and offer a broader more enriched recognition program. Times 
            they are a changing - and that includes UW's and VC who co-exist. 
            Don't judge all UW's by history because there's a new model that works 
            great with an internal VC as part of its heart and soul.</p>

            The bigger issue is the partnering of 211 and United Way - The whole 
            Gifts in Kind project has taken over time, attention, and staff. Our 
            Volunteer Center was a wonderful resource in the late 90's - workshops 
            were regularly scheduled, there was a single employee who was the 
            &quot;face and voice&quot; of the VC. Now, the emphasis is on being 
            the official channel for items that used to be given directly to various 
            non-profits, and which now can only be obtained after paying a membership 
            fee, and &quot;handling&quot; fee. The cover, of course, is that the 
            restructuring is more cost efficient, serving a more diverse group 
            of non-profits.</p>

            </strong></em>In Edmonton Alberta the Volunteer Centre closed on the 
            eve of its 50th anniversary because the United Way withdrew funding 
            after a number of years where the relationship was turbulent. The 
            United Way immediately snapped up the annual Volunteer Centre Fund 
            Raiser and started running it themselves &quot;to ensure that it continued 
            to serve the community.&quot; They then funded a limited recruitment 
            and referral service with another human service agency.<br>
            <br>
            The community has been struggling to find a new model for a volunteer 
            centre and recently called the United Way (and other funders) to task 
            for dragging its heels on moving the discussions forward. It may seem 
            to some that the United Way didn't want to create a new entity. They 
            have not yet offered to form a United Way Volunteer centre but I know 
            the thought has crossed their minds.</p>

            I believe Susan has hit the nail on the head. The Indianapolis area 
            had a Volunteer Center in the '90s and it, too, went by the wayside 
            as United Way funding challenges came on the horizon. During the heyday 
            of the center, there was some local television partnership providing 
            on air spots about volunteering and volunteer opportunities. When 
            the sponsorship/partnership dried up, the Volunteer Center dried up. 
            Although the Volunteer Center is still part of the United Way, the 
            activities are very limited with little and/or no publicity. And it 
            seemed as though the United Way agencies had preferential treatment 
            with regards to volunteer referrals than other organizations using 
            volunteers. </p>

            In San Diego, the Volunteer Center became independent from the United 
            way a few years ago. In January 2002 they merged with San Diego Cares 
            (an affiliate of City Cares)to form Volunteer San Diego (www.volunteersandiego.org). 
            In less than a year, we have become a dynamic, growing, proactive 
            agency that has become the premier volunteer organization in the San 
            Diego Area. We are still supported financially by the United Way, 
            but are gradually being weaned off that. We have a great staff and 
            board and lots of enthusiastic volunteers in our flexible program. 
            We also maintain close ties with our national affiliates, Points of 
            Light Foundation and City Cares. We feel we have a great thing going 
            here and would encourage other Volunteer Centers to do the same, if 
            possible. </p>

            The United Way and Volunteer Center in Bergen County formed a partnership 
            in 1998 for the purpose of establishing a single volunteer program, 
            while recognizing that we are separate organizations.</p>
          <p> Days of Caring are joint projects that are open to any not-for-profit 
            and volunteer group; the Volunteer Center handles placement of volunteers 
            from the community and the workplace; the Volunteer Center maintains 
            a searchable online database of volunteer opportunities to which we 
            have a direct link from our web site; we have a joint annual fundraiser; 
            and together formed the Northern New Jersey Business Volunteer Council 
            which boasts 28 corporate members.</p>
          <p> Through this partnership we have created a collaborative marketing 
            model that not only promotes volunteerism, but has contributed to 
            the fundraising and relationship building goals of both organizations.</p>
          <p> A key to our success is both organizations commit themselves to 
            co-branding so that the community sees a single response and the fact 
            that we both realized there was no value in an adversarial relationship 
            that frequently results in the United Way bringing their volunteer 
            activities &#8220;in-house&#8221;. Regardless of where volunteer activities 
            are placed, what needs to be remembered is what is best for the community.</p>

            has its challenges, I do not agree that &#8220;only when independent

            What becomes important is educating the parent organization&#8217;s

            the groundwork to work successfully with our parent organization without 
            compromising the purpose of Volunteer Central, which is to serve and 
            engage our community, both individuals and organizations, and to champion 
            meaningful volunteerism in Greater New Orleans. The key is we helped 
            our management understand that the success of Volunteer Central, functioning

            wagon vs. an Edsel. Volunteer Centers are quaint referral service 
            agencies (mainly) and as such do a lot of talking about volunteer 
            work but don't produce much in the way of sweat. And given their affiliation 
            with the government -- CNS, POLF -- would you really expect more? 
            United Ways are about as cutting edge as Volunteer Centers. Look at 
            who or what agency in any given town is engaging citizens in active, 
            hands on , flexible volunteering and build relationships there; leave 
            the dinosaurs to the natural history museums. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Submitted on 6Dec02 anonymously</strong></em><br>
            First and foremost--United Ways are in the business of raising money. 
            And let's not be so naive as to say it's all about the community. 
            The management staff at most UWs are paid VERY well. Meanwhile, they 
            fudge accounting figures info about their actual admintrative costs 
            and continue to fund their sweetheart agencies. Some UWs have not 
            taken on new agencies/programs for funding in ten years or more. The 
            Volunteer Centers are a threat to the continued monopoly UW has enjoyed 
            within the coporate sector conducting workplace campaigns. The more 
            pro-active VCs become in partnering (or attempting to) with business 
            and industry, the more agressive UW will become in absorbing them. 
            UW wants to be viewed as THE authority on issues and solutions in 
            each community. To achieve this, they need to be able to have the 
            VCs as a &quot;feel good&quot; image-builder so that the community 
            sees them involved in more than just asking for $ all the time--if 
            they are gung-ho on volunteering, they can't be all about $, right? 
            I am almost amused by the excuse making of the UW professionals who 
            have responded here. Come on, guys. Let's be honest. Sounds like you 
            actually believe all the UW brainwashing about &quot;community Impact&quot; 
            and the &quot;We fund PROGRAMS not agencies.&quot; Please. We all 
            know what the deal is. I'm glad Susan spoke up.</p>

            Our Volunteer Center was begun with In-Kind support from our United 
            Way in 1991 and funded by Corporate and Community Foundation gifts. 
            It was formed from the beginning to serve all nonprofit and governmental 
            organizations in our community. In 1995 after a wild 4-year ride from 
            great succcess to down-sizing by the UW CEO, a new CEO asked the UW 
            Board of Trustees to give the Volunteer Center a three year window 
            to become successful again. That worked! The key to the survival of 
            a Volunteer Center internal to another organization rests with the 
            leadership of both the Volunteer Center and the parent organization. 
          </p>
          <p>This center has grown in service to the entire community, has created 
            an annual fundraiser that is 44% of its budget and involves a segment 
            of our community that did not traditionally give to United Way, the 
            Home Builder Industry. This becomes a win-win situation for both UW 
            and the Volunteer Center.</p>
          <p>I have seen our Volunteer Center struggle with the issues of continued 
            growth demanded by the community, yet inhibited by the parent organization. 
            The solution has been to form a task force of all the community stakeholders 
            to recommend to the United Way Board of Trustees a solution both for 
            program and for additional funding. The Task Force recommendations 
            have been endorsed by the board.</p>
          <p>Currently the Volunteer Center enjoys a great relationship with our 
            parent organization, United Way of Hancock County. The Volunteer Center 
            is considered the &quot;Friendraising&quot; Arm of United Way and 
            provides the year-round visibility necessary to &quot;Building A Caring 
            Community&quot;--our vision statement. </p>
          <p>It would be extremely difficult for the Volunteer Center to raise 
            the funds in our rural community as an independent organization. We 
            need the United Way and it needs the Volunteer Center.</p>

            and that has been an incredible blessing. Has it always been easy, 
            no. But with the right leadership, the VC can flourish. Our BOD and 
            ED had enough insight to include fundraising, volunteerism, and community 
            building into our mission. Its not just lipservice, but a reality. 
            As the director I have the creative freedom to serve the community 
            at large not just UW member agenices. All of our services are open 
            to the agencies we serve. This VC has its own marketing, website, 
            programming, membership. . . But at the same time has stable funding, 
            the ability to use the good name of the UW when it suits, exist without 
            competetion, and the permission to be not just a resource but an area 
            expert on volunteerism. We use the benefits of our parent organization 
            just as they use our benefits. Its a win-win-win, for the UW, the 
            VC, and the community. Its not about sticking the UW nose where it 
            doesn't belong but where its needed in our community. </p>

            </strong></em>This is a very facinating conversation that is full 
            of only partial truths. I must be confused because I thought addressing 
            volunteer and community needs were best done at the local level. The 
            make-up of this entity should be driven locally whether it is a separate 
            or internal entity. I take offense to the notion that an internal 
            UW volunteer center isn't as strong as an independent. <br>
            <br>
            Volunteerism is a powerful, diverse business. Individual communities 
            focus on volunteer programs that meet their community needs. The gentlemen 
            from Memphis is addressing his community needs with only episodic 
            volunteers to answer their call. I'm not sure Michele Nunn will agree 
            with that narrow-minded approach but this is America and speech is 
            free. Here in Prince William, Virginia, The Voluntary Action Center 
            (an independent volunteer center) addresses our community volunteer 
            needs with a strong partnership with our United Way, episodic programs 
            for busy people, contracts with local government for Welfare to Work 
            and court mandated community service, contracts with local schools 
            for career building, hosting a federally funded RSVP program for seniors 
            and a I&amp;R program as our core value. These volunteer center programs 
            are by no means dinosaurs. We are pro-active in addressing our local 
            needs for both the volunteer perspective and community need. Let's 
            continue to share our best-practices. Let's never think we all have 
            to look alike. And please, no more generalizations.</p>

            form a VC. The project wasn't succussful until United Way volunteers 
            recommended the formation of a VC in a 1999 UW Stratigic Plan. They

            internal to our United Way, and like many others, serve all organizations

            over 185 organizations and the number increases monthly. The VC program 
            is fully supported by our Board. I love going out to employee campaign 
            meetings, because I get to speak to people about volunteerism. It's 
            a natural fit to us here. Volunteerism is not treated, as Susan put

            I should mention that the UW didn't &quot;suck up&quot; our Volunteer 
            Center, but rather agreed to the merger in order to save the Center.)</p>
          <p> Being internal to the UW has great advantages and very few disadvantages. 
            I am not restricted to working only with UW-funded agencies and have 
            the opportunity to work with any nonprofit agency that wants our help. 
            In fact, only about 1/3 of the Day of Caring projects completed each 
            year are at UW-funded agencies, and our projects include arts &amp; 
            cultural organizations, environmental groups, schools and community 
            parks in addition to the traditional health &amp; human service agencies. 
            I do have limited campaign responsibilities, but I view the employee 
            meetings as a great opportunity to promote volunteerism and talk about 
            what I do. When I get a call from an agency who needs a board members 
            with a special skill, or a client that desperately needs help with 
            Christmas, or even help with some plumbing or computer problems, I 
            have companies I can call on for help thanks to my affiliation with 
            the UW. And most importantly, my co-workers -- both campaign and community 
            building colleagues -- are my strongest supporters and do a better 
            job of promoting the Center than I do. So, if indeed the conditions 
            described by Ms. Ellis really do exist for some Volunteer Centers, 
            I'm sorry for them. But please, don't assume that all Centers internal 
            to a UW no longer are able to do what we set out to do: make our communities 
            a better place to live through volunteerism!</p>

            As the founder of The ManaTEEN Club, the nation's largest teen volunteer 
            program...and a program of the Volunteer Center of Manatee County, 
            Inc., I agree with you 100%!</p>
          <p> I am asked to speak to VCs around the country about replicating 
            our teen program and, without exception, only VCs that are independent 
            have been successful in developing a program similar in nature to 
            ours. Those VCs that are &quot;internal&quot; to United Ways or other 
            parent organizations tend to simply be a &quot;department&quot; of 
            the agency and the staff designated to manage the Volunteer component 
            usually aren't given much lead way in terms of budget, direct service, 
            etc.</p>
          <p> Our independent VC has grown during the last 10 years from a $40K 
            annual budget to one of more than $2million thanks to our innovative, 
            creative ways to get people of all ages to volunteer. I encourage 
            all internal VCs to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and take steps 
            toward independence! </p>

            I too am very concerned about the relationship between United Way 
            and Volunteer Centers. As an independent volunteer center we were 
            created by the United Way some 26 years ago and this year sustained 
            a 63% cut in support from them. The chairman of the United Way of 
            Southwest Alabama Board called me and said, &quot;We just don't value 
            your services.&quot; We will survive in spite of United Way, however, 
            I think the recent decision to break the agreement with the Points 
            of Light Foundation National Network of Volunteer Centers concerning 
            technology is a clear indication that we are no longer in an environment 
            with the United Way to collaborate or partner. </p>

            </em></strong>Way to go Susan. As a former director of a United Way 
            Volunteer Center I have first hand knowledge of what you have described. 
            Those who do not believe it will happen to them need to read &quot;Generations&quot; 
            by Strauss and Howe. This book delves into the attitudes and beliefs 
            of the past, present and future volunteers in this county. The current 
            volunteer pool, the Baby Boomers, do not believe in collective solutions 
            (for example, United Way) and will not support them in the traditional 
            manner of handing over money to let United Way do what it pleases 
            with it. They (the Boomers) demand more control and accountablility. 
            United way figured this out years ago, thus the Community Building/Community 
            Impact phase. What really is going on is they are now going after 
            the same grants, providing the same services and thus have become 
            the competition to the same agencies they profess to raise money to 
            support.</p>
          <p> As a Mangement Consultant, I work to educate agencies to realize 
            they are capable of supporting themselves if they understand who they 
            are, who their competition really is and how to survive in this volatile 
            changing climate. They need to know they are a business that can earn 
            their needed assets, not a chaity groveling for a hand out.</p>
          <p> As far as the Volunteer Center I directed. It now is a 211 phone 
            number or an online list of places to volunteer. I will admit there 
            has not been an out cry from the community or is there a local group 
            willing to support a Volunteer Center.</p>

            I manage more than 20 Youth Volunteer Centers in my community and 
            will grow to manage almost 30 by the end of this school year. I work 
            within a local nonprofit agency and have a relationship with United 
            Way. While our program has only been in existence for 5 years and 
            is the first of its kind in our county, we have already supported 
            an average of 60,000 youth service hours per year. Our local United 
            Way gives us financial support and linkages to some community agencies. 
            We are not a part of them and we will not become a part of them, because 
            what we are doing now works. We motivate over 16,000 youth per year 
            to get involved in their community through service; many of them are 
            first time volunteers. Our success is owed to my training in the field 
            of volunteerism, my growing relationships with local schools, agencies, 
            and churches, and support from philanthropic agencies and businesses 
            (including, but not limited to, the United Way). We're doing what 
            works. You should all do what works. Every community is different 
            and every United Way is different. (Thank goodness for that!) Stop 
            the generalizations and the &quot;we're the best&quot; speeches. Susan, 
            you make some excellent points applicable to many of your readers. 
            United Way responders, you do the same. But none of the views apply 
            to us all. As long as we continue to motivate volunteers towards community 
            service and do so in a way that is ethical, inclusive, well-managed 
            and effective, then we can all be successful. Enough said. </p>

            I had to laugh when I read this. It was almost as if Susan has been 
            sitting on my shoulder for the last six months. For the story she 
            told...is our story. Trust me I rarely agree with what Susan has to 
            say but every word of this is true.</p>
          <p> We were an independent center almost 20 years ago and floundering...then 
            UW came in swooped us up, saved us and helped us grow...sort of. The 
            VC was allowed to do it's work about 50% of the time and the other 
            50% were pulled off to concentrate on UW projects. Fair enough, they 
            funded us...kind of. We were an allocated program, our own mission, 
            vision, Steering Committee. We reaped the benefits and pitfalls of 
            being internal to a United Way...just as Susan says--growth was mostly 
            in Day of Caring...the kickoff to the CAMPAIGN.</p>
          <p> Take heed all of you out there internal VC's the winds of change 
            are upon us. This new direction for United Ways of &quot;impact&quot; 
            not just a fund raising pass through, will impact you. And Susan is 
            right folks....United Way business is Fund Raising and if you are 
            VC internal to a UW, if it's not your business now...it will be soon.</p>
          <p> Peter Drucker in the Drucker process has you determine...who is 
            your primary customer. Well, all of you UW's...that customer is the 
            donor--the donor gives money. For VC's, the customer is the volunteer...who 
            the UW wants to give MONEY</p>
          <p> So....for us, under a new strategic plan---with &quot;community 
            impact&quot; as the UW's goal, the VC has been realigned--mission 
            changed...to match the UW's; the goals, corporate volunteers--get 
            them to volunteer to...yes you can say it-- DONATE DOLLARS; the opportuntites, 
            in the critical issues area; Day of Caring, focus on critical issues 
            and member agencies--we're big folks, 230 agencies particpate on DOC, 
            7000 volunteers. Want to know how many of the 230 are &quot;member 
            agencies&quot;...less than 10%. Gonna change.</p>
          <p> The pendulum swings...for those of you who vehemently disagreed 
            with Susan and said, not true, not true, lucky you....for those like 
            us...right on Susan. </p>

            Thank you for a &quot;Hot Topic&quot; which inspires our community 
            to take inventory and share experiences. As a fellow member of Susan's 
            DOVIA, I would like to respond to her questions about our experience, 
            role and responsibility regarding a Volunteer Center in the Philadelphia/Delaware 
            Valley area. Conscious of the organizational changes underway at United 
            Way of Southeastern Pennsylvania, our DOVIA invited UW representatives 
            to attend or membership meeting in September 2000.We received a positive 
            response from our affiliate, a member of their staff attended and 
            our members had an opportunity to ask questions. Your observation 
            that formal references to a Volunteer Center have disappeared prompt 
            me to realize that follow-up invitation to our UW colleagues is now 
            in order to understand how their organizational changes have an impact 
            of volunteerism in our region. As the local DOVIA, our responsibility 
            is to provide our membership with the opportunity to gather information 
            and ask questions.<br>
            <br>
            Our experiences with local United Way staff have been very positive. 
            We count several local staff as members. One staff member who trains 
            volunteer program mangers routinely donates her time to do workshops 
            at our meetings and conferences. In the past, UW staff have served 
            as our officers and offered their office facilities for our meetings 
            and programs.<br>
            <br>
            While acknowledging our appreciation for this support, your topic 
            brings to our community's attention that as organizations and needs 
            evolve, those of us entrusted volunteer program administration have 
            a responsibility to constantly re-examine our own participation in 
            this process. Resources of all kinds will always be limited;let us 
            ensure that our imagination and commitment are not.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Submitted on 11Dec02 by Tracey Mann, Manager, Volunteer 
            Regina, United Way of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada</em></strong><br>
            I was disappointed Susan to read your article maligning those volunteer 
            centres that exist within their local United Way's. Since merging 
            in 1994 with the United Way here (after 17 years as an independent 
            centre), Volunteer Regina has enjoyed enhanced status in the community, 
            financial stability, and the luxury of being able to dedicate 100% 
            of staff resources to the delivery of volunteer centre services. Those 
            services are available to ANY community-based organization -- 95% 
            of the organizations we work with are NOT United Way funded agencies 
            -- and include sport, culture, recreation and health organizations.</p>
          <p> Contrary to the opinions you have expressed, United Way board and 
            staff are extremely supportive of Volunteer Regina, and in fact have 
            recently increased centre staffing by 100%. Volunteer centre programs 
            and services are as equally important as fundraising initiatives and 
            never have centre staff been asked to set aside volunteer centre commitments 
            in lieu of campaign (centre staff spent a grand total of 6 hours on 
            campaign this year). Our reality is that United Way staff contribute 
            far more time to support Volunteer Regina than the reverse.</p>
          <p> In an environment where we have seen the number of community-based 
            organizations exploding in recent years, our community has indicated 
            its support for the volunteer centre being housed within the United 
            Way, thereby reducing financial requirements to support another infrastructure 
            and volunteer commitment for yet another board. It is erroneous to 
            assume that all volunteer centres located within a United Way will 
            suffer as a result -- as always it is ultimately the community, not 
            the United Way, that will determine the value of a centre and how 
            it is best supported.</p>

            Susan, you have impressed me again for being not only up-to-date but 
            ahead of our time! My local community has struggled with this issue 
            for years because of the Director of our local United Way. She is 
            very controlling and doesn't welcome the community and volunteers 
            as part of the United Way except those hand-picked friends of hers 
            who serve on her board year after year. However, times may be changing 
            because of the recession. She will no longer be able to have her loaned 
            executives pressure folks into giving to something they don't see 
            helping their community, because these folks are not working now. 
            They are among the unemployed. We are all waiting for her retirement, 
            but worry that HER board will replace her with the same kind. </p>

            25 years has been a United Way Agency. However,this year the local

            I was pleased to read Ginger Murphy's response to Susan Ellis. It 
            is very balanced. I would also refer Susan to the Greater Philadelphia 
            listing on VolunteerSolution.org. More than 700 agencies advertise 
            their volunteer opportunities there- and there are over 1000 opportunities 
            listed. Those agencies that have United Way funding are clearly marked. 
            Many, many organizations do not receive UW funding but have the same 
            opportunity to list their offerings. Perhaps a bit more research before 
            spouting off would have helped the Hot Topic.</p>

            As chair of the Volunteer Center National Network Council, I feel 
            compelled to add my two cents to this discussion. I agree with some 
            of Susan's comments but would not go so far as to say the only viable 
            Volunteer Center is one that is independent. There are many good, 
            strong and effective Volunteer Centers that are internal to United 
            Way or some other organization and several folks from those centers 
            have chimed in here.</p>
          <p> At the same time, I have seen first hand how several internal Volunteer 
            Centers have been shut down by United Ways in North and South Carolina. 
            With the advent of 211 these United Ways have chosen to allocate their 
            increasingly limited resources to this new initiative. It's happened 
            even in larger cities like Raleigh and Columbia - both state capitals!</p>
          <p>Some mistakenly think that 211 can take the place of Volunteer Centers 
            - that's a laugh. It's true, 211 can give someone the contact information 
            for an agency looking for volunteers, but 211 is surely not going 
            to train volunteer managers, promote volunteerism, help someone select 
            a volunteer opportunity that meets their skills and interests or organize 
            a Corporate Volunteer Council. 211 is not and will never be a substitute 
            for Volunteer Centers and I sincerely hope United Ways will recognize 
            they are not serving the community when they think it can.</p>

            </em></strong>It is wonderful that so many different people have responded 
            this month and with so many perspectives. Generally, I avoid jumping 
            into the hot topic &quot;discussion&quot; since I feel I had &quot;my 
            say&quot; in the original post of the Hot Topic. However, several 
            people have questioned my knowledge of this topic and I feel a need 
            to give some explanation of my research.</p>
          <p><em>First</em>, I am very aware of what is going on in Philadelphia. 
            I have carefully reviewed VolunteerWay.org and I telephoned and spoke 
            at length with several people in Philadelphia in a position to know 
            what happened at our United Way and why.</p>
          <p><em>Second</em>, I am in the unique (and privileged) position of 
            being able to travel throughout the U.S. to learn about &quot;hot&quot; 
            trends. I assure everyone that I have personally discussed this month's 
            subject with at least two dozen people in the last year alone, in 
            cities both large and small (Volunteer Centers are often my hosts, 
            so I see this Hot Topic as trying to support, not hurt, them).</p>
          <p><em>Finally</em>, I have a long history on this subject with the 
            United Way of America, having written their publication, <em>Volunteer 
            Centers: Gearing Up for the 1990s</em>, which is out of print but 
            which UWA allowed me to continue making available for free on line.

          <p>Having a difference of opinion does not make either party ignorant. 
            It is possible to have the same facts and draw different conclusions.</p>

            (This goes both to Susan and to all who posted on this and other hot 
            topics). What a great Hot Topic even for us, so far away from your 
            reality and your challenges. As a national volunteer center manager, 
            working to support the development of existing and new volunteer centers 
            in my country, I find this discussion truly inspiring. We have both 
            self-incorporated volunteer centers and internal ones (not to UWs 
            - because we don't have this organization, but to various social service 
            agencies.) All your comments have provided such useful food for thought. 
            <br>
            As usual, your work and your experiences are our main inspiration, 
            given that volunteerism has not got much of a tradition in Romania. 
            So congratulations for being so communicative- thus allowing the rest 
            of us to avoid reinventing the wheel! And thank you. </p>

            Our United Way and Volunteer and Information Center merged into one 
            organization in 1992. The Executive Director's position is to recruit, 
            place, refer, recognize volunteers throughout community non-profit 
            organizations and at the same time fund-raising for selected agencies/programs. 
            Our community is small (16,000); therefore, we can efficiently and 
            effectively work with both programs. The Board of Directors govern 
            the complete operation of the office. Our Advisory Board is the sounding 
            board for community issues. I believe we have a win-win situation 
            and encourage other small communities to try it on for size. Larger 
            communities may not find it works as well. </p>

            </strong></em>What a fascinating hot topic! United Way agencies take 
            in a great deal of money, with very little public accountability. 
            Their access to employees with payroll deductions is brilliant. Any 
            not-for-profit could have sold itself in this way. I am always concerned 
            that United Ways are able to drive programs in local agencies because 
            of the strings attached to the funds. I would hope that not-for-profits 
            would become smarter about raising their own funding, diversifying 
            their funding streams and weaning off the Unity Way dole. That way 
            they could attract their own volunteers and not rely on the winds 
            of change. </p>

            In my opinion, contingency theory is alive and well and living in 
            this topic! In other words, &quot;it depends.&quot; I've lived through 
            most of a six-year reduction of United Way funding from 66% to 20% 
            of budget. It was certainly not much fun, and we were darn lucky that 
            the agency had cash reserves to continue programs and services to 
            the community. That said, I have also lived under new leadership, 
            for the past three years, that respects our capacity as an independent 
            agency, is our major funder at about 25% of budget, and with whom 
            we have a terrific reciprocating partnership based on mutual respect. 
            It all depends upon the leadership and motivation of the local organization. 
            If their agenda is truly community building, they can be the finest 
            partner a volunteer center has. If their agenda is based narrowly 
            upon their own organizational success, this can spell trouble for 
            a volunteer center, particularly one that's on shaky financial ground 
            and has become dependent on a single funding source. I believe the 
            contingency concept likely carries over to internal centers also--it 
            depends on the motivation of the leadership whether the partnership 
            works or not. I do, however, agree that the primary customer of a 
            volunteer center is the volunteer and the primary customer of a United 
            Way is the donor. This is tough to reconcile, and therefore I believe 
            the more effective structural model is the independent organization.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Submitted on 17Dec02 by Michael D. Call, President and 
            CEO, United Way of Rock River Valley IL<br>
            </em></strong>It's obvious that every community is unique. I've read 
            through the opinions expressed, and the full range of responses is 
            present. Here's mine. First, each United Way is independent. While 
            I acknowledge that some United Ways exist primarily to raise money, 
            others, including ours, exist to improve the community. Raising and 
            allocating funds is only ONE way we do this.</p>
          <p>Second, most Volunteer Centers have a mission that is in step with 
            their local United Way. Here in Rockford, Illinois, our Volunteer 
            Center is internal to our United Way. We view the Volunteer Center 
            as an integral part of our mission. On the campaign side of the business, 
            we recruit financial resources and distribute them. On the Volunteer 
            Center side of the business, we recruit human resources and &quot;distribute&quot; 
            them.</p>
          <p> Third, simply because of the name recognition, United Ways are often 
            the source for community and volunteer information. Volunteer Centers 
            generally don't enjoy a high level of community awareness. When the 
            Volunteer Center is internal to United Way, we (meaning United Way 
            AND the Volunteer Center) are able to provide better customer service.</p>
          <p>Fourth, most United Ways bring a high level of corporate and media 
            support, which we have found greatly benefits our internal Volunteer 
            Center.</p>
          <p>In the end, each community has determined--and will continue to determine--what 
            works best when it comes to not only referring volunteers, but also 
            promoting volunteering, making volunteering more effective, and building 
            strategic community coalitions to solve the most pressing problems.</p>
          <p>For us, having a Volunteer Center which is internal to United Way 
            works best.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Submitted on 17Dec02 by Betty Sue Cliff, Director, Volunteer 
            Center of Bi-County United Way, Inc., Missouri, USA<br>
            </strong></em><em> Re: United Way limits Volunteer Center effectiveness 
            and operations.</em><br>
            Rather than the United Way limiting a Volunteer Center&#8217;s effectiveness, 
            there are frequent examples of assistance given by United Ways to 
            Volunteer Centers, such as computer updating, training, etc. Praise 
            for Volunteer Center functioning within the community is part and 
            parcel of the good relationship between United ways and their Volunteer 
            Centers.In addition, United Way opens the door to a source of corporate 
            volunteering that is not easily available to independent entities, 
            thus removing the need to reinvent the wheel.<br>
            <em>Re: Volunteer Center staff being required to give priority to 
            United Way internal work.</em><br>
            The establishment of a free-standing status could easily offset this 
            so-called man-hour deficit by promoting an urgent need for man-hours 
            spent in individual fund raising from the community. The latter could 
            easily become the main focus of the Volunteer Center, rather than 
            being involved in helping to solve community problems. The Volunteer 
            Center would, of brutal necessity, need to focus on fund raising as 
            a matter of sheer survival.<br>
            <em>Re: Volunteer Centers being ruled by the United Way Board.</em><br>
            United Way Volunteer Centers are not ruled by the United Way Board, 
            except as being required to adhere to the same standards that apply 
            to qualifications for United Way funding of service agencies. Rather, 
            there is an Advisory Council whose chairman also sits of the United 
            Way Board to facilitate coordination and planning.<br>
            <em>Re: Volunteer Center&#8217;s being independent and doing fund 
            raising for them selves.</em><br>
            The whole idea of United Way funding a Volunteer Center is to provide 
            &shy; at no additional cost to the community volunteer placement for 
            the non-profit agencies within a said community. The purpose of volunteering 
            is to save individual agencies the expense of hiring additional staff, 
            which would cause them to need additional funding from the community 
            &shy; thus creating a vicious cycle of financial burdens on the community 
            they &shy; and the Volunteer Centers serve.<br>
            <em>Re: Day of Caring providing opportunities for United Way funded 
            agencies only.<br>
            </em> Agencies, in order to qualify for either funding or volunteer 
            placement services need only be 501(c)(3) and adhere to the non-discriminatory 
            requirements United Way demands of itself. The Day of Caring involves 
            many agencies who are not United Way funded, and who, as a matter 
            of record, have their own independent sources of funding. </p>

            </em></strong> While Susan&#8217;s comments may apply to certain communities, 
            they cannot be applied as blanket statements to all UWs, internal 
            VCs or communities. It is simply not valid to take one example and 
            project that to all communities.</p>
          <p>As Director of an Volunteer Center (VC) internal to United Way (UW) 
            and as chair of a Points of Light Foundation task force, focusing 
            on the Volunteer Center/United Way relationship with the goal to promote 
            models where VCs and UWs have developed ways to leverage the strengths 
            of each, we have found a number of examples where the internal VC 
            is a valuable and essential component of impact in the community. 
          </p>
          <p>In addition: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within the 1400 UWs there exists a wide variety of missions, goals, 
              programs &amp; services, etc. Statements such as &#8220;Volunteering 
              is so much broader in scope than the human service agencies within 
              the umbrella of a United Way&#8221;, &#8220;In most communities, 
              it is only United Way-funded agencies which are asked to develop 
              a volunteer project&#8221;, &#8220;As staff of the United Way, Volunteer 
              Center workers can &#8211; and usually are &#8211; diverted and 
              deployed to &#8220;priority work&#8221; when necessary&#8221; does 
              not ring true in any of the internal VCs that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>Given any community&#8217;s limited resources does it really make 
              sense to demand that there must be two separate organizations serving 
              similar if not compatible missions? What about all the independent 
              VCs that have had to close their doors? Being internal to UW can 
              provide stability and access to resources that many of the independent 
              VCs would love to have; resources from internal HR, MIS, Marketing 
              professionals etc. </li>
            <li>&#8220;&#8230;to keep internal costs down, an in-house Volunteer 
              Center is expected to stay small. Becoming an internal program of 
              a United Way is the kiss of death to future growth&#8221;; the opposite 
              may actual be true. In IL we have a number of small independent 
              VCs that have not been able to add staff or increase their budgets, 
              most have remained part-time single staffed offices while my Center 
              has been able to add both.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each community must decide how best to provide the necessary resources 
            to get and keep its citizens involved. This may mean a VC housed in 
            a UW, an independent with a UW partnership, or a VC internal to another 
            organization. Our national network needs to include a variety of structures 
            that can meet the specific needs that exist in each community and 
            not be restricted to a &#8220;One Size Fits All&#8221; model.</p>

            Good piece. The start of something? Who knows? It's a classic case 
            of the organization's survival and related self-interests trumping

            Institute in Cornwall, ON hosted by Volunteer Canada. 200 representative 
            from Canada's Voluntary Sector participated in this Institute. Contrary 
            to Alberta, I learned that many of Canada's Volunteer Centres are 
            internal to United Ways. Based on comments I heard about their experiences 
            and those of the respondents to this hot topic...I truly believe that 
            it comes down to what is best for that community - how services are 
            BEST delivered in THAT community. I see the benefits and challenges 
            of both sides.</p>

            I agree with Susan 110%. As the Vice Chairman of a privately funded 
            volunteer center in Philadelphia and a member of the Points of Light 
            Foundation, we feel that we have been squeezed by the Points of Light 
            Organization in favor of the United Way of SE PA. The Points of Light 
            Organization gives the United Way of SE PA a very broad territorial 
            area and now wants us to leave the POLF or change our geographical 
            location. How can the United Way of SE PA take such a large &quot;slot&quot;, 
            I am not sure, but I think the POLF has become a United Way concession.</p>

            WOW! The United Way in our area has an integral Volunteer Center. 
            Our YMCA is a member. Thankfully, our local United Way does put a 
            higher emphasis on the Volunteer Center than it sounds like other 
            UW's do. However, we (the YMCA) do recruit our own volunteers AND 
            raise our own funds, in addition to our annual allocation. I think 
            this is important to note. We collaborate with the United Way, but 
            we are still self sufficient both in our financial and our human resources. 
            United Ways have their place, but woe to the agency that &quot;puts 
            all their eggs in one basket&quot; by relying solely on their funding 
            and volunteer service through the United Way. </p>
