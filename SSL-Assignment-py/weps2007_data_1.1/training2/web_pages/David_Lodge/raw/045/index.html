<h3>Ginger, You're Barmy</h3>


<P><I>When it isn't prison, it's hell.</I>

<P><div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that's the heartfelt belief of conscripts Jonathan
Browne and Mike 'Ginger' Brady. For this is the British Army in the days
of National Service, a grimy deposit of post-war cynicism. It consists
of one endless, shambling round of kit layout, square-bashing, shepherd's
pie 'made from real shepherds', P.T. and drill relieved by the occasional
lecture on firearms or V.D. Reckless, impulsive Mike and the more pragmatic
Jonathan adopt radically different attitudes to this two-year confiscation
of their freedom ... and the consequences are dramatic.
</div>
<P><I>'This novel has all the ring of complete authenticity ... the mingling
of horror and farce are all brilliantly evoked'</I>


<DIV ALIGN=right> - A. N. Wilson in the Spectator</DIV>

<br>
<br>
<I>'Vivid, funny and with a compassion made all the more moving by the
harshness of its military setting'</I>

<P><DIV align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions of a wartime childhood in London
and subsequent post-war shortages have done little to enrich Timothy's
early youth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But everything changes when his glamorous older sister
Kath invites him to spend the summer at Heidelberg. Kath, who has long
since left home to work for the American army, introduces her sixteen-year-old
brother to a lifestyle that is deliriously fast, furious and extravagant.
Dazzled by the indulgent habits of the American forces, but at the same
time sensitive to the broken spirits of the German community beneath this
sparkling surface, Timothy will find that his summer holiday is in more
ways than one an unforgettable rite of passage.</div>

<P><I>'Mr Lodge has brilliantly dramatized a kind of Anglo-American encounter
... to have made so well-ordered and humanly engaging a work of fiction
in the process is a striking achievement'</I>
