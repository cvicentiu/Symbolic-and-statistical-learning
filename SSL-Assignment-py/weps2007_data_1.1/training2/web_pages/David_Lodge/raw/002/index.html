<h1>David Lodge</h1>
<p class="subtitle">1935-</p>
<hr />
<!-- PROFILE -->
<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>Critic and novelist. Born in Dulwich, south London and was a
pupil at St. Joseph's Academy, Blackheath, a Catholic school. He
attended University College, London (UCL) from 1952 until 1955,
where he read English. Following his graduation he undertook
national service and this is recalled in his novel <b>Ginger,
you're barmy</b> (1962). He then returned to UCL to complete a
large MA thesis on catholic fiction. He held posts at the School
of English, <a href="http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/birmingh.htm#unibirm">University of
Birmingham</a> , from 1960, subsequently becoming a Professor in
1976 until his retirement in 1987. He was made Honorary Professor
of Modern English Literature at the University following his
early retirement which he took in order to devote all his time to
writing.</p>
<p>He has published eleven novels, the latest <b>Thinks</b> ,
appearing in March 2001. A further novel, <b>Author, author</b>, about the success and failure of Henry James, is due in September 2004. His style in fiction has swung between
realism and parodies of literary styles and his knowledge of
academic circles has often been used to great effect. One of his
most enduring works is <b>Nice work</b> (1988) which is a
re-working of the popular nineteenth century industrial novel of
<a href="http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/gaskelle.htm">Elizabeth Gaskell</a> and others, and is
set in the West Midlands. Other well known novels include the
satirical campus novels <b>Changing places</b> (1975) and its
sequel, <b>Small world</b> (1984) which have been compared with
the work of Kingsley Amis in <b>Lucky Jim</b> (1954) and early
Malcolm Bradbury. David Lodge's thoughts on religion in 1970's
Britain forms the the background to <b>How far can you go</b>
(1978), a study of moral and sociological change.</p>
<p>During his long career at the University of Birmingham he
wrote several critical studies on modern literary trends and on
specific literary figures, including Graham Greene and <a href="http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/people/waugh.htm">Evelyn
Waugh</a>. <b>Language of fiction</b> (1966) remains one of his most
important critical works. More recent work includes <b>The
novelist at the crossroads</b> (1971) and <b>Write on</b>
(1986).</p>
<p>He has also written for the theatre and television,
with several plays and screenplay adaptations of his own novels,
such as <b>Nice work</b> for television in 1989. His first full
stage play, <b>The writing game</b> , was performed at the
Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1990. His second play, <b>Home
truths</b> was also produced at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre
in 1998 and subsequently turned into a novella, published in
1999. He had a notable success with his television adaptation of
<b>Martin Chuzzlewit</b> by Charles Dickens in 1994.</p>
<p>David Lodge's work has attracted much attention and he has won
many awards. In 1980, <b>How far can you go?</b> was proclaimed
Whitbread Book of the Year. <b>Small world</b> was shortlisted
for the Booker Prize in 1984, as was <b>Nice work</b> four years
later, going on to become the Sunday Express Book of the Year.
<b>Changing places</b> (1975) gained both the Hawthornden Prize
and the Yorkshire Post Fiction Prize. In 1998 he was awarded the
CBE (Commander of the British Empire) for his service to
literature.</p>
<p>David's latest book of essays, published in the autumn of
2002, is entitled <b>Consciousness and the novel: connected
essays</b> and includes discussion of <b>Therapy</b> and
<b>Thinks</b> .</p>
