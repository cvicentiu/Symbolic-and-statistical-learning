<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LIDIA VIANU:</font></b><font size="4"> 
You have written novels that escape into what you call ‘comic’, novels feeding 
on the reader’s smile and building irony into their plot and characters, as a <i>
sine qua non</i>. David Lodge could not be conceived of without his irony. But 
could he be understood if the reader banned lyricism altogether? When we least 
expect it, there are outbursts of warm insight, embedded in the comic framework, 
in the ironic mood. Is tenderness one of your weapons, or is it just an 
undesired effect of a sensibility that sometimes runs uncontrolled? Have you 
ever written poetry? Novels like <i>Out of the Shelter, Nice Work, Paradise News</i>, 
are the iron fist of irony within the velvet glove of sympathy. Your irony is 
not cold, but emotional. When you bite, it is done with soft teeth. You are a 
considerate comic novelist, if you accept this label. How much of your lyricism 
went into other kinds of writing than the novel?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DAVID LODGE:</font></b><font size="4"> 
These questions are so closely connected that I will answer them together.&nbsp; 
Certainly my novels are full of irony, both dramatic irony, and rhetorical 
irony, which is associated with comedy and satire.&nbsp; But you are right that there 
is also&nbsp; a softer, more emotionally tender (and some of my critics would say, 
sentimental) aspect to my work.&nbsp; I don’t see any contradiction in this. One of 
my great artistic heroes is Dickens who is both ironic and emotional to the 
point of sentimentality in different aspects of his work.&nbsp; I would not reject 
the description ‘considerate comic novelist’.&nbsp; ‘Compassionate’ might be a better 
word. I don’t think I am a savage, misanthropic satirist, and certainly not a 
tragic writer.&nbsp; In my later work particularly the ironic posture of the implied 
author towards the story is qualified by a more sympathetic (‘tender’, if you 
like) attitude towards the characters.&nbsp; <i>Nice Work</i> is a kind of 
transitional novel in that respect.&nbsp; The opening chapters take a very ironic, 
authorially mediated view of the two principal characters. But as the novel 
develops, the characters take over the novel, they become more rounded and 
sympathetic, and they change as a result of their interaction, while the 
authorial voice becomes less overt.&nbsp; <i>Changing Places</i> and <i>Small World</i> 
were&nbsp; generically conceived as ‘comic novels’ – comedy dominates the structure 
and texture of both, and licences a certain element of caricature in the 
characterisation and of farce in the action.&nbsp; <i>Nice Work</i> and its 
successors have comic elements, but I wouldn’t describe them as comic novels. 
They are just novels, literary novels.&nbsp; I’m not quite sure what you mean by 
lyricism, but lyric is&nbsp; first-person discourse, and I have used first person 
narration a lot in my last three novels (including the forthcoming <i>Thinks…)</i> 
&nbsp;perhaps in order to deal with the ‘tender’ emotions associated with love and 
death.&nbsp; Like most people with literary interests I wrote some poetry when I was 
very young, but I have only written a handful of poems in adult life, and none 
for many years now.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. What is 
your idea of the ideal ending for a novel? You smash the old happy end, the 
happy couple living happily ever after. The stream of consciousness writers did 
the same. The difference is you do not do that solely as an innovating trick. 
You actually see life that way, inconclusive and forever to be continued. How do 
you decide when a novel should end?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; This 
question links up with the preceding two, because how you end a story crucially 
affects the impression it leaves on the reader about the implied author’s 
attitude to life. I am fascinated by this question of endings, and have written 
about it in several critical essays.&nbsp; As modern literary novelists go, I think I 
am more drawn than most to the old-fashioned ‘happy ending’, and have sometimes 
been criticised for it, though you don’t seem to agree.&nbsp; I tend to leave my 
characters in an open-ended situation, but a hopeful one, with the major 
problems they have confronted in the story resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; This resolution of the 
issues raised by the narrative is a constant preoccupation while writing the 
novel for me. I always have a provisional idea of how the story is going to end, 
but usually this is modified as the composition of the work proceeds.&nbsp; This is 
because there are so many ‘codes’ involved in writing a novel – the codes of 
narrative coherence, psychological plausibility, thematic significance, formal 
elegance, etc etc. and the ending must satisfy on all these levels. Also, you 
discover so much of what you want to say in the process of writing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. One of your 
characters in <i>The Picturegoers </i>(1960), Harry, touches upon the major 
issue of teenage violence, which was the concern of Lessing, Burgess, Golding 
and others. You do not write about this again. It is a dystopic interest that 
might characterize a Desperado. Is the issue important to you? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. <i>The 
Picturegoers </i>is a very early, immature novel,&nbsp; and reflects the influence 
Graham Greene had on me at that time. Harry is somewhat derivative from the 
character of Pinkie, the teenage gangster in Greene’s <i>Brighton Rock. </i>&nbsp;He 
is not really based on experience or observation.&nbsp; I have never been much drawn 
to the depiction of violent or psychopathic behaviour, like the writers you 
mention, for temperamental reasons touched on above.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. In <i>
Ginger, You’re Barmy</i> (1962), another kind of violence, the political one, 
caused by the IRA, is woven in the relaxed irony of the plot. You undermine the 
idea of positive hero, placing the bad student who ruins his life on a pedestal. 
The traditional pattern of the novel seems deliberately forced to turn upside 
down. Is it more important to you to smash known patterns with irony, or to 
sound an earnest alarm? Are you ironical before anything else, or alongside with 
an interest in politics, problems of religious belief?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. <i>Ginger
</i>is another novel written under the influence of Greene. It has a similar 
structure to that of&nbsp; <i>The Quiet American. </i>&nbsp;I wanted to write a novel that 
would sum up the institution of National Service (i.e. two years’ compulsory 
military service for young men) as I experienced it,&nbsp; not long before it was 
abolished in Britain because it had ceased to serve any useful purpose.&nbsp; My own 
response shifted from a shocked resistance to the military ethos (I declined to 
try for an officer’s commission in Basic Training) to pragmatic resignation and 
a determination to make life as comfortable as possible for myself. I developed 
these two responses into two separate characters and contrasted their fortunes.&nbsp; 
I suppose the novel reflects my own aversion to risky, romantic gestures, but 
also a certain grudging admiration for those who make them.&nbsp; Like Fowler in <i>
The Quiet American </i>Jonathan has ‘won’ in the end but feels as if he has 
lost. I think it’s a novel about morality and values rather than politics or 
religious belief as such.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. Your novels 
take the reader by surprise, prove his taste in romance old fashioned. Do you 
aim at surprise? Is it a major concern with you? What is your relationship with 
your reader?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; I think 
any good story should surprise the reader. If its development is totally 
predictable, there’s not much point in reading it (unless it’s a true story).&nbsp; 
How this can work when you re-read a fictional story is an interesting question 
– but it does; somehow you suppress your own knowledge to increase the pleasure 
of the text.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the basic satisfactions of narrative is peripetia,&nbsp; a 
development that is both surprising and convincing, which accords with our 
experience that life is essentially unpredictable but governed by cause and 
effect. Frank Kermode has written very well about this in <i>The Sense of an 
Ending.&nbsp; </i>One aspect of the craft of fiction is to disguise the evidence that 
will retrospectively make your surprises convincing when they occur.&nbsp; 
Traditional romance as a genre tends to just pile on the surprises without 
bothering to make them convincing.&nbsp; The realistic novel tries to make them seem 
part of the representation of the real.&nbsp; One’s ‘contract’ with one’s reader 
depends partly on the genre of the work, the implicit rules by which it is 
governed. I called <i>Small World </i>an ‘academic romance’ to licence myself to 
incorporate a lot of improbable twists and coincidences in the plot. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. <i>The 
British Museum Is Falling Down</i> (1965), not unlike <i>Souls and Bodies</i> 
(1990), focusses on a religious approach to life, which you contradict in <i>
Paradise News</i> (1991). What does religion mean to you? How serious are you 
when you mock at its effects on everyday life? How moralizing?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. I think if 
you read my novels in sequence you will see a gradual waning of orthodox 
religious belief in the ‘implied author’.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t propose to comment here on 
the ‘real author’s’ religious position.&nbsp; <i>The British Museum is Falling Down</i> 
satirised Catholic doctrine, especially as regards sex, from within orthodoxy.
<i>How Far Can You Go? </i>(called <i>Souls and Bodies</i> in the US) takes a 
more detached, more ironic view of the decline in orthodox belief and practice 
and questions its survival.&nbsp; <i>Paradise News </i>is written from an implied 
post-Christian perspective – which is not the same as non-Christian or 
anti-Christian.&nbsp; Simple belief in the transcendental is almost impossible, but 
the fundamental problems that religion addresses remain.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. In <i>The 
British Museum Is Falling Down</i>, and even more in <i>Out of the Shelter</i> 
(1970), the theme of America returning to her English origins, to Europe even, 
is obvious. The approach is totally opposite to Henry James. Americans are 
ridiculed. You have taught at Berkeley, yourself. Your trilogy, <i>Changing 
Places</i>, shows how familiar you are with American academics’ life. Do you 
view this theme of the American superiority with the same relaxed irony, with a 
sociologist’s concern, or with a touch of bitterness? What did your American 
experience mean to you?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; America 
and American culture are certainly key elements in my life and work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t 
think Americans are ‘ridiculed’ by contrast with British or European people in 
my novels. All races are impartially mocked and satirised.&nbsp; I have always 
considered myself as generally sympathetic to America.&nbsp; To someone who was a 
child in World War 2, America was the powerful ally who helped us win, and its 
culture as mediated by films, magazines etc., epitomised the kind of 
materialistic good life for which Europe longed in the aftermath of war, and now 
enjoys.&nbsp; So I have used America as a way of exploring&nbsp; the theme of the pursuit 
of happiness ( a very American theme) by bringing my repressed Brits into 
contact with it.&nbsp; For what America has meant to me see my essay ‘The Bowling 
Alley and The Sun’ in </font><i><font size="4">Write On.</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. In <i>Out 
of the Shelter</i> (1970), you are, it seems, more autobiographical, which is 
something you do not usually do. You also win the reader’s sympathy 
deliberately, which again you are unwilling to do openly in the other novels. 
Humour is your main character, most often than not. How much does your private 
life interfere with your imagination? Do you allow yourself to get lyrically 
involved when you write a novel?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; <i>Out of 
the Shelter </i>was a novel specifically sourced from my first actual encounter 
with American culture, and with Continental Europe, as a youth of 16.&nbsp; I think 
in retrospect it cleaves too closely to my own experience (not in the story, but 
in the detail of the setting) so remains a limited, but I think truthful piece 
of work.&nbsp; I think&nbsp; most novelists write more directly from their own experience 
in their earlier work, then, perhaps when they have ‘used it up’, deliberately 
research their novels.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. Do you have 
a favourite type of criticism? What critics do you hate (as a category)? What 
should the ideal critic do when faced with one of your texts? What is your 
favourite critical approach? The Desperado critic, in my view, is the critic who 
makes ample use of all critical approaches he knows, determined to understand 
the text but rejecting any device which would become an obstacle (see 
Deconstruction, which Bradbury so wonderfully deconstructed in <i>Mensonge</i>). 
Like the Desperado novelist, he returns to the pleasure of the narrative. Do you 
accept scholarly criticism? Should criticism be an enigma, to be decoded in its 
turn, in order to decode the work afterwards? Criticism is literature in itself, 
but should it make use of confusion as its peculiar suspense?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. There are 
different kinds of criticism which have different functions, from the 
journalistic to the scholarly. All have their place. Whatever type it is, I 
think criticism should be a pleasure to read by those who have an interest in 
it.&nbsp; I deplore the tendency of much (though not all) post-structuralist 
criticism to cultivate mystification deliberately.&nbsp; A good critical essay has a 
kind of plot – it has satisfying surprises in it.&nbsp; Reviewing has a special 
responsibility to be fair, because it affects the first reception of the work.&nbsp; 
Academic criticism is usually written when the book already has some kind of 
established currency, and so can follow its own agenda without doing much damage 
to the book or its readers.&nbsp; However I generally avoid reading academic 
criticism of my own work – its tendency to display mastery over the text can 
seem oppressive to the author.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like criticism which judges what the writer 
has done with his subject, rather than quarrelling with the subject, and which 
gives evidence to support its judgments.&nbsp; I dislike criticism which is 
motivated&nbsp; primarily by literary politics, or personal animus, or personal

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. You are not 
very fond of the academic world, and use it to create humorous patterns which 
support your plots. The basic idea is that academics get themselves into 
situations which are hilarious, and even when you are not directly mocking at 
them, when the novel is more or less in earnest (see <i>Nice Work</i>), you 
cannot help creating ironical parallelisms. Bradbury has the same attitude, and, 
just like you, he was an academic. You taught for a while together in 
Birmingham. How do you feel about your status as an academic? Does it help 
novel-writing? Or criticism? Do you still teach? What? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; I was a 
university teacher from 1960 to 1987 (part-time in the last 3 years), then I 
took early retirement to write full-time.&nbsp; I enjoyed my work as an academic, 
especially the first two decades, and took it seriously, as both teacher and 
scholar.&nbsp; I published a novel and a critical book in alternation in these years. 
I never felt any creative or intellectual tension between these two activities: 
they complemented each other. But on the social-psychological level it was a 
kind of schizophrenic&nbsp; existence.&nbsp; I did not operate in the University as a 
novelist – I did not read my work on campus or discuss it with my students or 
teach creative writing (at Birmingham – I did elsewhere).&nbsp; I operated as a 
serious, committed academic.&nbsp; The novels, which often satirised or carnivalised 
the academic world,&nbsp; belonged to a separate compartment of my life.&nbsp; It was a 
rather artificial distinction, and I was quite glad when I was able to take 
early retirement in 1987 to become a full-time writer. I am an Emeritus 
professor now. I don’t teach any courses – for one thing I am getting hard of 
hearing – but I do very occasionally give a lecture or reading.&nbsp; Malcolm 
Bradbury and I were colleagues occupying adjacent offices for some years in the 
early 60s, and very close in every way. I valued our friendship, which continued 
after he moved to East Anglia,&nbsp; enormously and I was desolated by his untimely 
death last November.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. Your novels 
help the reader find himself and learn how to read. You are a critic and a 
novelist at the same time. How do you feel about clarity, the return to the 
story and characters? Do you feel like innovating, or merely entertaining your 
readers, in no sophisticated way?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. I think you 
can tell I am a teacher and critic in my novels, because I am careful to give 
the readers all the information and clues they need to follow and understand my 
meaning. Some critics think I try too hard to control the reader’s response. It 
is not for me to say.&nbsp; I certainly see writing as essentially communication, as 
a rhetorical activity.&nbsp; And in the highest sense I think art must entertain, or 
give delight.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. <i>Changing 
Places</i> (1975) ends with a suggestion that a movie might do more than a 
written story. I do not think you really favour the film over the book, as what 
you say must always be taken with a grain of salt, but I will ask all the same: 
What do you think will be the future of the book? Can the screen (cinema, 
computer, television, ‘telescreen,’ etc.) supersede the pleasure of reading?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. A big 
question. Brief answer: no, I don’t think visual and electronic media will make 
reading and the book obsolete.&nbsp; But the interaction between them will increase.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. Do you have 
a plan for your plot from the very beginning, and enrich it with details as you 
go along, or do you start with a mood and invent the story each day, as it 
comes? Is plot important?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">. I have a 
provisional outline plot before I start writing, but it has a lot of blanks, 
like white space on old maps, which I fill up as I go along and that usually 
entails changing the outline I started with.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">LV</font></b><font size="4">. What kind 
of writer would you say you are: comic, reflexive, deeply moral, tricky, 
innovative, involved, ironical? Does your writerly self bear any semblance to 
your everyday self? What is essential in the daily life of the author David 
Lodge?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4">DL</font></b><font size="4">.&nbsp; It is not 
for me to describe ‘David Lodge’ the implied author of my books – it is for 
readers and critics.&nbsp; </font></p>
