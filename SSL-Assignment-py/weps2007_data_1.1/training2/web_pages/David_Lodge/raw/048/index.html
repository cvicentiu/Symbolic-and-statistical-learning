      <h2><em>&quot;Author, Author&quot;</em></h2>
      <p>(Reviewed by <a href="http://mostlyfiction.com/about.html#guy" target="_self">Guy Savage </a> AUG 26, 2006)</p>
      <p class="style3">Henry liked to keep his friends in watertight  compartments, sometimes singly, sometimes in groups, so that information about  himself should not leak from one to another. Writing fiction, however artful,  was inevitably to some degree an exposure of the author&rsquo;s own self, his own  soul, and the fewer facts about one&rsquo;s private life that one&rsquo;s friends and the  general public had in their possession, by the light of which to make  comparisons and inferences, the better.</p>

      <p>The novel <strong>Author,  Author</strong> is an ambitious departure from David Lodge&rsquo;s normal tales of  academia, but the novel works, and it works quite brilliantly. Lodge explores  the psyche of his subject- Henry James --a quiet, introspective man who had many  acquaintances but only a few close friends, and he rarely placed any true  confidences into the laps of even those he counted part of his innermost circle.  He had a horror of the exposure of his private life, and also many conflicting  feelings about those he was closest to--fellow writer, Constance Fenimore  Woolson and dear friend George Du Maurier.</p>
      <p>The novel begins in December 1915--a few months before  James&rsquo;s death, and then goes back to the 1880s. This was an extremely difficult  period for Henry James. To date, his books were not selling, and while James  had the ambition to be the century&rsquo;s equivalent of Dickens or George Eliot, he  was beginning to realize that this would not be achieved. For those of us who  love the work of Henry James, the novel&rsquo;s often intimate exposure of this  brilliant author&rsquo;s deepest insecurities is at once painful and tragic. Today,  James finally has the reputation he longed for and deserved--but which so  cruelly eluded him during his lifetime. </p>
      <p><strong>Author, Author</strong> is  a glittering presentation of the literary talent and culture of the times.  David Lodge drops the names of the famous, and the infamous of the  fin-de-siecle period lavishly throughout the text--George Bernard Shaw is seen  as a hard-working theatre critic: &ldquo;I am incorruptible. And besides I need the  money&rdquo;--rubbing shoulders with H.G Wells--who&rsquo;s just sold his first short  story. Also scattered on these pages are glimpses of Alma-Tadema, Lord  Leighton, Christina Rossetti, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, Edith  Wharton, Stephen Crane, Dreyfus and the notorious Oscar Wilde. </p>
      <p>James has reached a point in his life when he has begun to  accept his relative &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as a novelist. <strong>The Tragic Muse</strong> just sold for the embarrassingly small sum of  seventy pounds, the publisher of <strong>The  Bostonians</strong> and <strong>Princess Casamassima</strong> lost money on the venture, and James has just received a rejection slip for a  submitted short story. James realizes that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not that it was getting more  difficult for novelists to become rich--quite the contrary--but they were the  wrong ones.&rdquo; Rider Haggard&rsquo;s novel <u>She</u> enjoys vastly superior sales to  anything written by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Stevenson&rsquo;s sales look  positively healthy when compared to the anemic numbers sold of anything written  by Henry James. His books remain out-of-the-mainstream, and while a few  literary critics recognize James&rsquo;s talent, his books are not popular and do not  sell. With pressing financial concerns--plus a need to assuage his damaged ego,  James turns to the stage--hoping to write a best-selling play. Ironically, his  closest friend George Du Maurier, a popular cartoonist for Punch Magazine is  rapidly losing his sight, and turns to literature as a means to feed his  boisterous, talented family. The novel methodically and with an amazing amount  of detail follows Henry James through his attempts to capture fame as a  playwright. Devoting years to his goal, James suffers several humiliating and  frustrating experiences before adapting <strong>The  American</strong> to the stage. At the same time, Du Maurier produces a mediocre  book, <strong>Peter Ibbetson</strong> before he  writes the phenomenally successful <strong>Trilby</strong>.  Lodge explores the ironies of Du Maurier&rsquo;s and James&rsquo;s parallel career shifts,  as Du Maurier notes: &ldquo;we are both old troupers now &hellip; compelled to learns new  tricks and perform them wherever an audience can be found.&rdquo; To James, the  success of <strong>Trilby</strong> remains a  puzzle--the secret of which he cannot analyze to his satisfaction, and he  suffers from pangs of envy at his friend&rsquo;s success. It is as if in unlocking  the key to Du Maurier&rsquo;s success, James believes he can duplicate it. </p>
      <p>The novel follows James&rsquo;s dogged determination to produce a  successful play, and the final result--<strong>Guy  Domville</strong> while exploring the problems of maintaining objectivity about  one&rsquo;s own work, and James&rsquo;s intense identification with his play&rsquo;s aesthetic  hero. James&rsquo;s lack of objectivity is in contrast to the astute observations of  actress Elizabeth Robins--a professional who is a &ldquo;great admirer of Henry as a  novelist and as a critic&rdquo; but has serious reservations about &ldquo;whether he really  had the dramatic gift.&rdquo; She realizes that his plays &ldquo;lacked something she could  best describe as a real passion for the theatre as a medium of artistic  expression. He was fascinated by it, but at the same time he despised it, and  brought only his second-best ideas to it.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Obviously James&rsquo;s private thoughts, if never articulated,  remain pure speculation, but in Lodge&rsquo;s capable hands, it is a speculation that  works. Fans of Lodge&rsquo;s works will definitely be surprised by his change of pace  in this novel, and some fans will necessarily be disappointed--after all this  novel does not resemble Lodge&rsquo;s entertaining, humorous pokes at the lives of  privileged, often insensitive academics. <strong>Author,  Author</strong> is an intense read, and it is an excellent one. The novel is laced  with traces of ideas that led to later novels--<strong>The Spoils of Poynton</strong>, <strong>The  Awkward Age</strong>, <strong>Wings of a Dove</strong>, <strong>The Golden Bowl</strong> and <strong>What Maisie Knew</strong>. Ultimately, Lodge  portrays James&rsquo;s attempts to write a successful play as the catalyst for  insecurities that begin the terrible trend to constantly revise. On another  level, the novel is also a testament to the Du Mauriers--a talented but  ultimately tragic brood. For James fans, <strong>Author,  Author</strong> is a feast. Lodge manages to successfully enter the mind of his  subject and presents a sympathetic portrait of this difficult, elusive subject. </p>
