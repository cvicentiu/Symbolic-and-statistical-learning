<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" color="#CCCCFF">A Brief History of King 
David's Lodge No. 209</font></b></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Academy Engraved LET" size="6" color="#CCCCFF">O</font>n May 16, 1861, a Masonic 
Lodge was chartered in San Luis Obispo with the title of San Luis Obispo Lodge 
#148. Due to the drought of 1862-1864, the Lodge had to surrender its charter. 
All records of this Lodge were lost in the San Francisco fire of 1906. Masonry 
expanded in the County when San Simeon Lodge #196 was chartered December 12, 
1869.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<font face="Academy Engraved LET">T</font></b>he need for another lodge in 
the county was felt when a number of Masons met at the funeral for Alexander 
Murray in May 1870. They took necessary steps for forming a Lodge in San Luis 
Obispo and King David's Lodge #209 was the result. Its charter dated October 13, 
1870.</p>

<img border="0" src="lodge.JPG" align="left" width="293" height="350"></font><b><font face="Academy Engraved LET">I</font></b>n its early years, King 
David's Lodge had its share of troubles and problems. These were caused by great 
differences in background and temperament of the brethren; post-Civil War 
allegiances and feelings; and, of course, ever-present money difficulties. They 
were rough days.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<font face="Academy Engraved LET">I</font></b>ncreasing population of San 
Luis Obispo and growth in membership of the Lodge made it necessary to find 
suitable facilities for a meeting place. Several locations were utilized over 
the years, finally settling on the present location at 859 Marsh Street. The 
Hall Association and the Lodge built its present building at a total equipped 
cost of $57,093.16. The building was dedicated December 19, 1913.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<font face="Academy Engraved LET">S</font></b>ome years ago, interest was 
felt in selling the present property and erecting a new building at the edge of 
town where parking would be less of a problem. After discussion and 
consideration, it was decided that the brothers loved this building and it was 
decided to retrofit it for earthquake and fire resistance. This was done and we 
continue to occupy the building at 869 Marsh Street.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<font face="Academy Engraved LET">T</font></b>he Lodge has had a continuing 
involvement in the affairs of the city. As an example, it has taken Hawthorne 
School under its wing, doing some tutoring of students in reading and helping 
financially from time to time. Recognition of police and fire departments in 
appreciation of their services is done regularly.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Academy Engraved LET">K</font></b>ing David's Lodge continues 
to be a factor in the community of San Luis Obispo, and we welcome new members 
who will help us to continue our work.</p>

with King David's, bringing more members into the No. 209 F. &amp; A.M.</p>
