She founded the Center for Italian Studies in the Palm Beaches, Florida, and was Director until the end of 2000. She authored many articles on Italian art, literature, and culture and published 11 books, including a definitive Italian grammar, major works on Futurism, and Italian art history. Dr. Clough was knighted in 1972 and 1996 by the Italian government, receiving the title of ''Commendatore, Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana.'' In 1995, she was elected to the Hunter College Hall of Fame. She was an educator with boundless energy whose accomplishments are evident in the success of her students. She is mourned by many friends, by her two sons, Shepard A. Clough of Lexington, MA., and Peter N.

A memorial service is planned at the Ann Norton Sculpture Gardens in West Palm Beach on December 1. Tax deductible donations may be made to the Rosa T.
