        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"></font><font size="-1">The essays in <i>Powers of Good and Evil</i> contribute primarily to a tradition within anthropology of studies of conceptions of evil and their relation to political economy that perhaps began around 1980 but that has roots in classical social theory. Jon Mitchell, in his introduction to the volume, identifies the collection’s focus as the problem of excess and the repercussions in religious life of the experience of being socioeconomically peripheral. Those repercussions are diverse and include changes in religious representations, increase in witchcraft accusations, and fissioning of religious organizations.<br><br> “Dangerous Creatures and the Enchantment of Modern Life” by Bonno Thoden van Velzen and Ineke van Wetering is a comparative study of concepts of evil spirits among the Ndyuka Maroons of Suriname and witchcraft in 17th-century Sweden and New England. Thoden van Velzen and van Wetering employ a concept of collective fantasy (“products of the imagination . . . always related to the realities of power, but in a loose and non-deterministic way” [p. 18]) that draws directly on Freud’s concepts of dream processes. Peter Geschiere also takes a comparative approach in “Witchcraft and New Forms of Wealth: Regional Variations in South and West Cameroon,” concluding that witchcraft is not always “a ‘traditional’ barrier against change and innovation” (p. 65) and that there is great variation in magical responses to new forms of wealth among the peoples he discusses. Jon Mitchell examines “The Devil, Satanism and the Evil Eye in Contemporary Malta” in the context of a tension between “tradition” and “modernity,” finding that the devil is associated with modernity and the evil eye with local conceptions of “tradition.” Bodily experience of the devil, Mitchell asserts, accompanies some of the trends of modernity and collectively expresses the same sort of ambivalence toward accumulation observed by other contributors to the volume. Birgit Meyer’s “‘You Devil, Go Away From Me!’ Pentecostalist African Christianity and the Powers of Good and Evil” explores the relations among evangelical Christianity, socioeconomic change, and the increasing salience of images of Satan in Ghana. Meyer argues “that recurrence to images of Satan . . . should not be regarded as a residue of traditional thinking, but as part and parcel of people’s engagement with modernity. The image of the Devil is at the centre of an imaginary space through which people may address modernity’s temptations and malcontents” (p. 105). Nadia Theuma moves away from the central theme of the powers of good and evil in “Modernity, Crisis and the Rise of Charismatic Catholicism in the Maltese Islands,” a discussion of gender and hierarchy in the context of recent religious change. Hildi Mitchell returns to the focal concerns of the volume in “Good, Evil and Godhood: Mormon Morality in the Material World.” The Mormon case contrasts sharply with others presented in the volume. In providing a view of material accumulation as unambiguously positive, Mitchell concludes that “Mormon economics is at a basic level a <i>moral</i>--as opposed to immoral--economy in which engagement with the material world is essential to make mortals more God-like” (p.182). In “The State and the Empire of Evil,” Jojada Verrips examines horror films (and other films judged to be potential sources of evil) and attempts to censor them. Like van Velzen and van Wetering, she makes a psychodynamic argument, asserting that these films have a necessary ego-defensive function (not her terms), but she does not take the thesis very far and its onus is carried in the sources she cites. Verrips also argues that these films have an ideological function, though this thesis, too, is not well developed. Isabelle Borg, in “The Iconography of Evil in Maltese Art,” examines material representations of the devil through time, relating them to practices and doctrine in Maltese Catholicism as well as the idiosyncratic conceptions of artists.<br><br>	Paul Clough comments on the volume’s contributions in “Conclusions: The Political Economy behind the Powers of Good and Evil.” Clough faces a challenging task given the topical diversity of the essays, but he finds five common themes in them “concerning the forms of both religious imaginings and the social organization of ‘force’” (p. 233). He notes first that most of the the authors examine societies often regarded as peripheral or modernizing. Second, Clough observes that they consider “to what extent are Peripheries mentally and conceptually dependent on, or subordinate to, the value-and-thought systems of the Centre?” (p. 234). I find the phrase “conceptually dependent” inadequate and prefer to view the interaction in terms of concepts deriving from the “Center” encountering ideas from the “Periphery,” with a relationship of economic dependence linking the two sectors. The third theme Clough finds in these essays, one that overlaps awkwardly with the second, is that of power, both intrasocietal and intersocietal. Here he highlights some of what he considers the more important observations in the contributions, such as Thoden van Velzen and van Wetering’s demonstration that “In societies very differently situated in time and space, accusations of witchcraft or demonic possession intensify when communities feel their marginality in relation to an economic growth pole in world trade” (p. 234). The fourth theme Clough detects is violence. He observes that “the <i>global economy is a commodity market structured by political and military power. The capitalist economy is only one pole of that market</i>” (p. 240). The fifth theme he discerns is that of “the action of local individuals ‘with strength’ [quoting Taussig] who carve out human domains of religious influence” (p. 240). He arrives at a few general conclusions. One is that “‘globalization’ contributes to rather than diminishes the diversity of social beliefs . . . The world remains a strangely eclectic, enchanted place . . . We . . . need to consider in what ways the the technical possibilities of global trade and communication empower conceptual and relational diversity” (p. 241). I think the extent to which this can be seen as valid depends on what one wishes to consider diversity. Clough also considers the volume’s contributions in light of Foucault’s conception of power and concludes that “the long-term, gradual, and successful translation of ecclesiastical-sovereign power (Foucault) or industrial organization (Marx) into a unified ‘conceptual apparatus’, dampens down the proliferation of supernatural entities” (p. 244). He regards Malta as a “liminal case” between Core and Periphery. Perhaps his most general conclusion is that “where consciousness of a power gap exists, the local, feverishly preoccupied with its religious imaginings and its efforts to exert influence over others, always acts as a counter-claim on human minds against centralizing groups and elites” (p. 248).<br><br>	One finishes reading this volume with a strong sense of the complexity of historical contingencies in the relations between religious life and socioeconomic change. This volume has much to offer those with an interest in transformations of religious life in late modernity, especially from its anthropological perspective on local responses in the context of the world political economy. Some of the chapters are excellent; Thoden van Velzen and van Wetering’s, Meyer’s, and Geschiere’s are especially stimulating and will be useful in classroom discussion. Some of the writers are apparently nonnative speakers of English, and there are some distracting errors of usage as well as many typographical errors, but this does not detract from the overall value of the volume. As we begin another violent century, conceptions of the powers of good and evil are much in evidence and demand our attention.<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font></font><font size="-1"></font><font size="-1"></font><font size="-1"></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"></font></p>
