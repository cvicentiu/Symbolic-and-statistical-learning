Descendants of: John Clough          

1 John Clough b. 1614 d. 26 Jul 1691 
  m. Jane ________ d. 16 Jan 1679 
  m. Martha Cilley m. 15 Jan 1686 d. 1692 
    Jane: 
  Ref.  BT09-30-39, LCKnowels 
  Martha: 
    		Ref. LDS-BT09-30-39, EOrcut Martha may have had two children from a previous
		marriage.  The Cilley name is one of early settlers of Hampton and Rye, NH
  2 Elizabeth Clough b. 16 Dec 1642 d. 30 Sep 1707 
    m. William Horne d. 28 Jun 1689 
    Ref. DBStevens, DDSouthall (Desc. of John Clough)
    
        	Elizabeth , being educated, was the only woman able to sign her name to a
		petition February 20, 1689/90.  She was taken by indians and probably killed 
		September 30, 1707.  A Reverand John Pike wrote: "Old Widow Horne was taken 
		by indians near the lower corner of Capt. Gerrishes field.
  
   William: 
    Ref. DBStevens, DDSouthall
    
    William was killed by indians during a raid on the Waldron Garrison House.
    
    Ref. HWHorne (source ?)
      
           William Horne, the first of the name in Dover, NH was in Salisbury, MA as
		early as 1658.   On Sept. 20, 1661, William bought land of Elder Edward
		Starbuck, 240 acres between Cocheco (Dover) embracing what is known as 6th
		Street, Dover on Horne's Hill.  William was killed in the Indian massacre in
		Dover, June 28,1689.  His widow was killed by indians while walking the road.

            William Horne was the son of Johannes Horne of London.  He was Christened at
		St. James, Clerkenwell, June 9, 1609.  The family tradition is that he and his
		brother, John, came to America at the same time, 1630.  John settled in Salem,
		MA and William probably stayed there for a while.  Nothing has been recorded
		about him until he is first mentioned in Dover, NH in 1659.

            Johannes Horne was a descendant of Reginaldis Horne of Pachsley England.
		William Hornes English background has been traced by Mrs. Leland Gile (Bessie
		Allen) of Alfred, ME, who is also a descendant of William Horne.  The English
		records trace William's ancestry to about 1450.

    3 Mary Horne b. 1667 - 1672 
      m. John Hayes m. 28 Jun 1686 d. 25 Oct 1708 
      John: 
      Ref. DDSouthall, GBPickup 
      
      Emigrant from Scotland abt 1680 (DDSouthall).
      
            "It is a family tradition that John came to America as a refugee after the
		defeat of the Scot Covenanters at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, but
		this has never been proved.  He was at Dover, NH in 1680 and is referred to in
		Dover history as the "Scotsman" and as the "Covenanter".  Some branches of the
		Hayes family use the Hayes coat of arms (Burke's Peerage 1935 p. 913) but it
		cannot be proved that the descent from him supports any claim to its use.  The
		earliest town records of Dover now in existance begin with the year 1694 and
		from then on he is frequently mentioned as receiving grants of land and his
		signature is on many colonial documents.  He died very suddenly, leaving no
		will."  (GBPickup)
      4 John Hayes b. 1686/7 d. 3 Jul 1759 
        m. Tamsen (Wentworth) Chesley m. abt. 1711 b. 1687 d. 30 Dec 1753

        m. Mary Roberts m. by 1718 
            Ref. DDSouthall, GBPickup Was called "Deacon John" The inscription on his
		gravestone reads: "Deacon John, the first born of the Pilgrim Fathers of the
		New England Hayes family. In deeds he is referred to as house-wright and
		carpenter, was constable, deacon of First Church, did Scout duty in the Indian
		Wars.  He accumulated extensive land holdings and his name appears among the
		proprietors in securing charters for formation of nearby towns.

        Tamsen: 
        Ref. DDSouthall, GBPickup
        
		Gardner Pickup's mother and father-in-law records relate the following:
        
            "The Wentworth family was without doubt the most prominent of the colonial
		familes of New Hampshire.  In about a hundred years proceeding the Revolution
		the affairs of the province were administered by Wentworth governors.
		Intermarriage of the two familes (Wentworth & Hayes) was frequent. The Hayes
		family by its industry, integrity and ability, together with the Wentworth
		family, has made a alrge contribution to the upbuilding of the state and
		nation. "   "John HAyes - A Book of His Family"

            "John Hayes married Tamisen Wentworth widow of James Chesley, who was killed
		by the indians 09-17-1707."

          m. Tamsen Drew m. by 1762 
                    Gardner Pickup's data on Paul and Mercy's marriage has the marrage occuring
			sometime between April 18, 1741 and 1744.

          Mercy: 
          Ref.  GBPickup, DDSouthall
          
		Her name also recorded as Marcy. 
          
            DDSouthall's records state that Mercy was "not in father's will" but  GBPickup
		states that his mother's records indicate "Joseph Evans will, 3 Dec. 1750
		mentions "my daughter Mercy Hayes" to have œ100 out of my estate".

				November, 1997, "Uncle Richard died yesterday...    He was a very successful
				man.  He designed and manufactured automobile parts.  Although he sold the
				business quite some time ago, the business still carries his name.  The motto
				is: "If it's Fairbanks - it's fast."  The company was in upstate New York but
				has since relocated to Florada.  Althoughhe had a ninth grade education, he
				was allowed to attend Wentworth Institute here in Boston.  He very much loved
				automobiles and made that his life's work.    He was a very devout husband and
				was with my Aunt Jeannie for 64 years.  He died at home in Wildwood, FL of a
				massive coronary.  He was a very nice man, I miss him already.  He was my
				favorite uncle.

                       Jenny: 
                        	Although she was given the name Jenny at birth she always used Jean or
					Jeannie.  Jean & Richard didn't have any children.

				his parents died while he was a child.  During the Mexican War he was a
				bodyguard for General Santa Anna, Commander of the Mexican Forces.  He was
				taken ill at New Orleans on the way home and died there.
              		Virginia Schofield wrote to me in a letter of Jan. 16, 1998 the following:
              
              "....
                        I also spent hours reading library books on the Mexican War and General
				Santa Anna.  Although the books did not refer to Charles Brown Clough, it was
				interesting to find that the Northern U.S. was not in favor of the war as the
				South was.  Also now I know why he was not buried with his family.  I had been
				wondering where he was!  The fact that he was an orphan and married Abbie
				Breed, the daughter of a very rich man in Lynn, seems to me to be the reason
				he joined the Mexican forces.  Santa Anna promised land and money to Americans
				who would join him.  Charles Brown Clough probably wanted to make money to
				provide for Abbie and his only child.  Rather a pathetic ending to their life.
				I have his portrait as a handsome young man."

                        The name Celinda is a weak link for Phyllis M. Lumb.  In her letter to me
				(George W. Estey), she states that she is trying to prove Malinda and Celinda
				are one and the same person.  The Malinda Clough in the JCGS book has the same
				birthday as Celinda Clough in the Mills genealogy.  The Mills book has Celinda
				marrying James Miller.  The JCGS Book only states that Malinda and James
				Miller had 6 to 8 children.  With the Lumb records also having  a spouse of
				Joseph Mills could she have married twice?
              James:

                		An obituary for James T. Sloggy written some time shortly after his death. 
 
                HOLD SERVICES FOR JAS. SLOGGY
                
                        "Funeral services for James Theodore Sloggy, 83, a former employee of the
				city at the LaGrande power plant, who died early in the week, were held
				Thursday  at 1:30 p. m. at the Piper chapel, Rev. E. E. Tuck presiding;
				burial was at Mountain View burial park.  He was a member of Rev. Tuck's
				church.

                        Mr. Sloggy returned July 3 from a visit with a daughter, Mrs. George Estes
				in Los Angeles, where he went in November, and his wife, Emma Virginia Sloggy,
				came from Seattle the same day, where she had been visiting with a daughter,
				Mr. Jeff H. McNichol, and they re-established their home at 5931 South I
				Street, where they had lived for 25 years.  Then came the end of the veteran
				resident after a week of illness.

                        Mr. and Mr. Sloggy were married in St. Paul years ago, and came to Tacoma
				seven years later.  Besides the daughters, a son, David, of Seattle survives."

                        Note the spelling of the Estey name; a common error made by people and one
				we Estey's, no-doubt, will continue to endure.    (George W. Estey, June 17,
				1998)

                        Yesterday my son Gregg and I located I Street mentioned in the obituary
				and found 5931 South I Street;  a small bungalow style house of the 1900 era
				which has had some work done on the exterior to modernize it.  It looks as if
				the people who live there now take pride in the upkeep of the home.  (June 17,
				1998)

                        Wife Emma Virginia was James' second wife and  they were married  about 1901
				using the data from the obituary (25 year resident of Tacoma and married 7
				years before moving from the St. Paul area).  This would be some 10 years
				following the death of his first wife, Lydia.  The daughter, Mrs. Jeff H.
				McNichol, is the daughter of Emma and we do not have information as to who her
				father was.  It could have been James which would make her a half-sister to
				Mae Lydia,  David, and John.  (GWE June 17, 1998)

                    Ref. MCDonald papers, GWEstey, MSEstey
                    
                        Sometime around 1921, when she was about 13 years of age, Violet took ill with
				jaundice or what today is called hepatitis.  She suffered from the effects of
				this for a long period of time.  Due to the need for constant care and her
				mother being burdened with the chores of boarding people in the home, Violet
				went to San Marino, CA to live for a time with her Uncle John and Aunt Gurtie
				Abel.  This is where my mother learned to sew, knit  and crochet.  This was
				the time when she played in the historic adobe house which stands by the
				swimming pool at the San Marino High School.  Violet made many of her clothes
				including her wedding dress.  She also learned from her Aunt Gurtie how to
				paint green pottery and china and glaze the same.

                        My memories of my mother while I was growing up are of a woman who had many
				talents and from her, I believe I gained the attitude that nothing was
				impossible to do.  (George Warren Estey. 1997)
