            <br>
            Speaking before the Prime Minister travelled from Downing Street to
            Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament, Mr Howard
            put his party on the front foot with a promise to &quot;do the best
            for Britain&quot; with an action programme that would reward the
            hardworking law abiding majority, while delivering improved school
            discipline, cleaner hospitals, more police on the streets and
            controlled immigration.</font></p>
            <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 60; margin-right: 60; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <br>
            Kicking off the party campaign in the courtyard of a central London
            hotel, he declared: &quot;The choice before the voters on May 5 is
            very clear: they can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of
            broken promises and vote for another five years of talk; or they can
            vote Conservative, to support a party that's taken a stand and is
            committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working
            Britons.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Insisting that the Labour government has &quot;lost the plot&quot;,
            Mr Howard accused Tony Blair of taking honest hardworking people for
            granted, and failing to recognise how worried NHS patients are about
            hospital infections, how pensions are fearful of rising crime, and
            how parents fear that their children cannot learn in class because
            of the lack of proper school discipline.<br>
            <br>
            Denouncing the way Labour has frittered away huge tax incomes with
            little improvement in public services, Mr Howard offered a
            &quot;better way&quot; which would help those who &quot;do the right
            thing and play by the rules&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            He said the Conservative timetable for action would build a
            brighter, better future for the country, with more value for money
            and lower taxes, with discipline restored to schools, with hospital
            matrons given the power to close wards infected with MRSA; with
            reduced crime, and an extra 5000 more police officers on the streets
            each year backed by tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers;
            and controlled immigration with an annual limit on the number of
            people who can settle in Britain.<br>
            <br>
            He declared: &quot;Some people say I shouldn't talk about difficult
            issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who
            stick two fingers up to the law. But we cannot make Britain a better
            place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet. Everyone knows
            you won't fix a problem if you aren't even prepared to discuss
            it.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Mr Howard said he was not prepared to appease special interest
            groups, and wanted all Britons to play by the same rules.<br>
            <br>
            Buoyed up by improving opinion poll surveys and a party brimming
            with confidence and enthusiasm, Mr Howard said that while the Prime
            Minister was already secretly grinning about the prospect of his
            third victory, there was no reason why the country had to deliver
            Labour a third term in Downing Street.<br>
            <br>
            And in a clear message to the electorate he embarked on a vigorous
            four week nationwide campaign declaring: &quot;If you're thinking
            what we're thinking, it's time for urgent action on the things that
            really matter: reward for hardworking Britons; school discipline;
            cleaner hospitals; more police; and controlled immigration. So I say
            again, the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear. They
            can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken promises and
            vote for another five years of talk. Or they can vote Conservative,
            to support a party that's taken a stand and is committed to action
            on the issues that matter to hard working Britons.&quot;</font></p>

              <br>
              We will cut crime by each year putting 5000 more police officers -

              <br>
              People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of
              it.<br>
              <br>
              Mr. Blair promised that he had no plans to increase tax at all.<br>
              <br>
              But he has put taxes up 66 times - mostly by stealth.<br>
              <br>
              And it's hurting.<br>
              <br>
              According to the independent Institute for fiscal studies average
              incomes have started to fall for the first time in ten years.<br>

              It's not the rich getting soaked.<br>

              It is normal, hard working families trying to make ends meet.<br>
              <br>
              And if Mr. Blair gets in again  taxes will go up again.<br>
              <br>
              Rarely in the history of politics has a government spent so much,
              taxed so much and achieved so little.<br>
              <br>
              People work hard, they pay their taxes and they deserve value for
              their money.<br>
              <br>
              But today, families are paying an average of £5,000 in extra tax
              a year - and what have they got to show for it?<br>
              <br>
              Everyone knows there is no such thing as a free lunch.<br>
              <br>
              With Mr Blair you pay for lunch  and it never seems to turn up.<br>
              <br>
              Britain cannot carry on indefinitely spending more than it is
              earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates.<br>
              <br>
              If we are to secure our future economic prosperity, government
              must once again start to live within its means.<br>
              <br>
              There are two Britains today: private sector Britain, where people
              are working harder just to stand still, struggling just to make
              ends meet.<br>
              <br>
              And bureaucratic Britain, where money is no object, you spend what
              you like, you employ who you like.<br>
              <br>
              For every job the private sector lost last year, the public sector
              took on almost two more. Britain cannot carry on like this without
              storing up huge problems for the future.<br>
              <br>
              You know a country is living on borrowed time when government is
              the fastest growing industry in town.<br>
              <br>
              So we have a plan to get a grip on government spending.<br>
              <br>
              That's why a Conservative government will cut waste.<br>
              <br>
              There'll be 20 per cent fewer MPs, and 20 per cent fewer
              government ministers.<br>
              <br>
              Over 160 quangos will disappear.<br>
              <br>
              235,000 bureaucratic posts will go.<br>
              <br>
              We'll scrap the New Deal.<br>
              <br>
              There'll be no new Supreme Court.<br>
              <br>
              And as for those unelected, unaccountable regional assemblies, the
              playthings of John Prescott, we'll get rid of them too.<br>
              <br>
              Yes, these decisions are tough - but they are right.<br>
              <br>
              Right because they'll get resources to the front line - to our
              schools and hospitals - giving taxpayers value for their money.<br>
              <br>
              Right because they'll help pay of debt and avoid Mr. Blair's tax
              rises.<br>
              <br>
              And right because they'll enable a Conservative to lower taxes.<br>

              I believe that families are better at spending their hard earned
              cash than any politician.<br>
              <br>
              That is why Conservatives will cut taxes.<br>
              <br>
              The hardest hit by Labour's stealth taxes have been the older
              generation.<br>
              <br>
              If you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their
              older relatives.<br>
              <br>
              And if you want to know about a country, look at how it cares for
              its older generation.<br>
              <br>
              How a country treats the older generation is a test of its values.<br>
              <br>
              Many served our country in her greatest hour of need, fighting for
              liberty, freedom and Britain's independence for future
              generations.<br>
              <br>
              We must never forget the contribution they have made - and
              continue to make to our communities.<br>
              <br>
              But in Britain today too many pensioners are not shown the respect
              they deserve or given the dignity that is their due.<br>
              <br>
              The older generation don't seem to feature in Mr Blair's New
              Britain.<br>
              <br>
              New Labour's Britain is a country where the older generation has
              been airbrushed out.<br>
              <br>
              As Frank Field, Mr Blair's own former social security minister,
              has said Labour took one of the best pensions systems in Europe
              and turned into one of the worst.<br>
              <br>
              People who saved for their retirement suddenly found that the
              money they'd put aside simply wasn't there - that the value of
              their pensions had been destroyed by Mr Blair's stealth taxes.<br>
              <br>
              And Labour have forced nearly half all pensioners are onto means
              testing.<br>
              <br>
              Pensioners quite rightly resent means testing.<br>
              <br>
              It is at total odds with the values of the forgotten majority -
              the people who work hard, who take responsibility for themselves
              and save for their retirement.<br>
              <br>
              Means testing is wrong.<br>
              <br>
              It penalises people for doing the right thing - saving for their
              retirement.<br>
              <br>
              It sends a clear signal to the younger generation: &quot;Don't
              bother to save. Spend whatever you can before you retire, because
              your future is one of dependency on the State&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              Means testing is humiliating - forcing pensioners to go cap in
              hand to the State for what they are due.<br>
              <br>
              And means testing is complicated. That's why over one and a half
              million eligible pensioners don't even claim what they are owed.<br>
              <br>
              I want our country to honour our senior citizens, cherish their
              wisdom and care for their needs - a country where they can live in
              security and with dignity, respected and protected.<br>
              <br>
              To those who have given so much, we must surely give what is their
              due.<br>
              <br>
              I will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings,
              making pensioners up to £11 a week better off after four years.<br>
              <br>
              By increasing the basic pension, we will free hundreds of
              thousands pensioners from the tyranny of means tested benefits -
              restoring their dignity, independence and self-respect.<br>
              <br>
              I will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a
              fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of £500. This
              will ensure that Council Tax bills for five million pensioners are
              cut.<br>
              <br>
              Taken together these proposals will mean that pensioner households
              will be up to £1,000 a year better off - it's a thousand pounds.<br>
              <br>
              And I will stop the disgrace of elderly people being forced to
              sell their homes, saying goodbye forever to their independence, to
              pay for their residential care.</font></p>

              <br>
              It's important that government rewards people who work hard and
              have contributed to our society.<br>
              <br>
              And it's important too that government upholds the law.<br>
              <br>
              Some people say I shouldn't talk about difficult issues like the
              abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two
              fingers up to the law.<br>
              <br>
              But we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult
              issues under the carpet.<br>
              <br>
              Everyone knows you won't fix a problem if you aren't even prepared
              to discuss it.<br>
              <br>
              I'm not prepared to appease special interest groups because I
              believe passionately in fair play.<br>
              <br>
              We are all British and we should all have to play by the same
              rules.<br>
              <br>
              Nor will I be distracted from doing what I believe is best for
              Britain by the smirking politics of Mr Blair or the woolly
              thinking of the Liberal Democrats.<br>
              <br>
              So on each of these issues - on rewarding those who work hard and
              have contributed to our country, on schools, on hospitals, on
              crime and on immigration - we have a detailed, published Timetable
              for Action so you can hold us to account.<br>
              <br>
              Look for this commitment in your paper, check it on the net, put
              it up on your fridge door - hold me to it.<br>
              <br>
              And beware yet another election where Mr Blair says one thing to
              get your vote on polling day and does something quite different
              afterwards.<br>
              <br>
              Mr. Blair is already secretly grinning about the prospect of his
              third victory.<br>
              <br>
              Imagine five more years of him.<br>
              <br>
              Well you don't have to settle for it.<br>
              <br>
              If you're thinking what we're thinking, it's time for urgent
              action on the things that really matter:<br>
              <br>
              - Reward for hardworking Britons;<br>
              <br>
              - School discipline;<br>
              <br>
              - Cleaner hospitals;<br>
              <br>
              - More police; and<br>
              <br>
              - Controlled immigration.<br>
              <br>
              So I say again, the choice before voters on May the fifth is very
              clear.<br>
              <br>
              They can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken
              promises and vote for another five years of talk.<br>
              <br>
              Or they can vote Conservative, to support a party that's taken a
              stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard
              working Britons.&quot;</font></p>
