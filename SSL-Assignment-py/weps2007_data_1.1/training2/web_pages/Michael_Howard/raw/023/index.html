                  village of Waldringfield aimed at holiday home owners and people 
                  who are planning now for their retirement.<br>
                  The stunning three-bedroom property offers luxury accommodation 
                  for homeowners who may enjoy good health and mobility now, but 
                  who may need their accommodation to be more versatile as they 
                  get older.<br>
                  Genoa Lodge in Waldringfield is spacious and luxurious and does 
                  not compromise on quality, but also takes into account the needs 
                  of people getting older. There would be no need to move again 
                  should circumstances make the owners less able.&#8221;<br>
                  The ground floor of Genoa Lodge features a large bedroom with 
                  en suite shower room and a spacious, open plan living area with 
                  a feature vaulted ceiling. This area would enable self-contained 
                  ground floor living should it ever be required. Upstairs there 
                  is a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, and a second bedroom 
                  with an en-suite shower room.<br>
                  An integrated vacuuming system has been installed so there is 
                  no need to carry a heavy vacuum cleaner around the house. Each 
                  floor has connections for a lightweight hose and the system 
                  connects to a cylinder in the garage, which only requires emptying 
                  two or three times a year.<br>
                  In keeping with the Colonial New England style, the property 
                  features a maintenance-free cladding exterior finish, steep 
                  roof slope and dormer windows.<br>
                  Genoa Lodge at Waldringfield is on a large plot with mature 
                  trees and features a single cart lodge garage. Genoa Lodge is

        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">Environmentally-conscious 
        property developer Michael Howard Homes is pulling out all the stops to 
        ensure that two mature holm oak trees are protected during the 
        construction of a luxury four-bedroom house in the village of Holbrook.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">The Dedham-based developer 
        has called in a specialist team of tree experts to carry out advanced 
        new tree treatments, using the very latest in technology, to protect the 
        roots of the holm oaks (<i>quercus ilex</i>) during the construction of 
        a driveway to the new £435,000 property which is due to be completed in 
        the summer.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">Mike Dewhurst from Eastwood 
        Tree Services in Coddenham said: “Taking the driveway over the root 
        system of the trees is normally detrimental to the structure of the 
        roots, but with new technology and materials the damaging effect can be 
        dramatically reduced.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">“We will be feeding the 
        root system by injecting into it special products that will develop the 
        root system to become more efficient in extracting water and nutrients 
        from the soil, thus enabling the trees to overcome the stress of the new 
        entrance.”</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">The root system of a mature 
        tree can extend between one and two times the height and spread of the 
        tree. The main feeding roots of a tree are located within the first 
        200mm of the soil level so any compaction or soil removed will cause 
        damage without specialist equipment being used. </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">“We will be using a special 
        air spade that allows us to excavate within the root system without any 
        long-term damage to the health of the tree,” added Mike Dewhurst. “This 
        is cutting-edge tree care and our staff our fully trained in this new 
        approach and we are specialists in this field.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
        <font color="#7F8FA8" style="font-size: 9pt">“Builders are not normally 
        sympathetic to trees and Michael Howard Home’s taking the trouble and 
        expense to protect <br>
        these holm oaks is an excellent example of a professional builder 
        working with a professional tree company.”<br>
        The driveway being installed over the root system will <br>
        spread the weight of the vehicles by means of a very strong mesh 
        allowing the weight to be spread over the roots. <br>
        It will be constructed of a porous material enabling the <br>
        water to percolate into the root system and air and <br>
        gases to be exchanged.</font></span></p>

<br><br><span class="text">A controversial piece of contaminated and potentially 
    dangerous land in the village of Dedham has been cleaned up by local 
    property developer Michael Howard Homes and work has begun on building a 
    brand new £1 million plus luxury home on the site.

<br><br>

    The land, the site of the old gas works in Mill Lane, was so contaminated 
    that it had become potentially harmful to the environment. Michael Howard 
    Homes demolished former The Mallard restaurant on the site and cleared some 
    1500 tonnes of contaminated waste from the area to make it safe and suitable 
    for development. 

<br><br>

    “This was a very difficult and hugely expensive clean-up operation due to 
    the extent of the contamination and the fact that the site is close to a 
    river,” said Adrian Mann, construction director of Dedham-based Michael 
    Howard Homes.

<br><br>

    Michael Howard Homes consulted closely with Colchester Borough Council 
    planners and the Dedham Vale Society to produced agreed plans for the new 
    property, Millstream House, which will be a five-bedroom house featuring a 
    four-car lodge and 1,000-bottle wine cellar. It will be built using 
    traditional methods and incorporating locally reclaimed materials.
