          </div>
      <div class="body">America as a nation and America as a people face great challenges in the years ahead. Those challenges, and the way in which they are handled, will determine not only our future but the future of the entire world. Never in the course of human history has there been a global force as powerful politically, socially and economically as the US is today. For better or for worse many of the decisions made by the US government have global implications, implications that reach far beyond our borders, far beyond any Americans realm of experience and knowledge. From the fight against AIDs on the ground in Africa to the global war on terror to corrupt governments in less developed nations to the growing global environmental crisis that threatens civilizations as a whole, the actions and inactions of the US government are felt through out the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
***An Educated Population Leads to Good Government:<br />
<br />
This is an awesome amount of power and the responsibility lies squarely at the feet of the American people. No matter that few of us realize it, our government governs with our consent and we, by default, consent to the way in which it governs. The actions of the US government should reflect the needs and views of the people and it is the responsibility of the people to be educated enough on the issues to recognize real needs and form intelligent views; an informed population controls government, an uninformed population is controlled by government. Those of who look at history with a critical eye have seen it time and time again and those who look at current events see it happening now: North Korea and China, with their state controlled media which attempts to suppress any news that might cast doubt on the motivations of their respective governments are prime examples of governments keeping the population uninformed in an effort to control that population.<br />
<br />
It is the duty of every American to, at the very least, educate themselves on the more important issues facing the nation and world. It is the duty of the government to provide the population with avenues to higher education: An uneducated population benefits only an oppressive government. It is for this reason that increases in education spending is absolutely necessary. Improved performance and opportunity at all levels of education, from preschool to graduate school, is vital to America’s future and, by default, the future of the world. Greater educational opportunity for all Americans should be a clearly stated and aggressively pursued goal of our government. Not a talking point, not a hollow promise trumpeted more loudly as Election Day draws near, but an absolute national priority given full funding and the full attention of governing bodies at the local, state and national level. Our nation’s education system is in crisis, and, again, by default, so is our nation’s future and the future of the world as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
***Good Government Serves the Interests of the People<br />
<br />
The sooner the American population realizes that the fate of the world’s population rests, while not entirely but certainly disproportionately, with us and our elected leaders, the sooner we will begin to take this into consideration when choosing our leaders. We must ask ourselves: Whose interests are being served in Washington DC? It is imperative that we, the people, see to it that it is our best interests being served; that we are fairly, competently and honestly represented. Not the lobbyist and the interests that they represent, not corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton for whom the Iraq war has been an unimaginable windfall with the bill being handed to the American taxpayer an unfathomable source of revenue. The influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC. The business community and the general public have competing interests, and what is good for one is not necessarily, perhaps even rarely, good for the other. Politicians should not be businessmen, and businessmen should not be politicians. Among the ideas upon which America was founded was the separation of church and state. There was good reason for this; historically the union of church and state resulted in diminished freedom, diminished rights and diminished opportunity for the general public. The framers of our constitution were well aware of this fact; however, had they known that the influence of the business community on government would have resulted in the current climate of corruption and greed in which the interests of the American people take a backseat to the personal financial gain of elected officials and their business partners, would they have included similar restrictions on business-government relationships? <br />
<br />
Again, the influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC. The method and manner in which campaigns are financed must be drastically altered and new standards of ethics must be imposed upon those that seek political office. When a corporation benefits from the actions of an elected official and then, in turn, that elected official benefits from the actions of that corporation the appearance of impropriety, if not the fact, are inescapable. The business community and the government must be separated whenever and wherever they meet. The opportunity for corruption, the allure of ill-gotten gains, is too great and human nature is too fallible to leave our government and our future to promises of good judgment and altruistic motives. When campaigns are financed by taxpayers, when each campaign is given an equal amount of financial resources and outside funds are prohibited then and only then will the interests of the people of this nation be served. If this requires an amendment to the constitution to strip corporations of what they deemed to be their right of free speech, so be it. If given the choice between a corporation’s right to free speech and Americas right to a government that is free of corruption, a government that will serve the interests of its people I can only think of one group that would side with the corporations and that would be the corporations themselves. <br />
<br />
Our future, the future of our nation and, by default, the future of the world rests in the hands of our elected officials and being that it is our vote that elects those officials I ask you this question: What is your responsibility?</div>

          </div>
      <div class="body">I can always hear a *but* coming in a speech, in a news report, even in casual conversation. I can even hear the unspoken *but*s; the implied *but*s. I cannot believe that such a talent is genetic but my father was very much the same. I could not watch a movie with him, he always, without fail, knew the ending long before the plot began to wind down. He was forever anticipating, forever futuring into the storyline. In my experience he was never wrong. Unlike me, he was not overly political. Having been born in 1933, and raised in an era where the media was a completely and totally different beast. He died during Clintons first term before the true nature of the beast was to be revealed. I wonder, though, if he saw that coming. I would like to think that he did.<br />
<br />
But, I can always see a *but* coming, even when one is hiding (and they often hide). For Instance: *The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations and labor organizations from using their general treasury funds to make contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections. In spite of this broad prohibition, there are many ways in which a corporation or labor union my legally participate in federal election activities.* So says the FECs Campaign Guide. There is no *but* in there, but the *but* is clear as day. If *In spite of* and *but* are not interchangeable in this instance stop reading now because the rest of this will not make any sense to you. According to dictionary.com (my preference in linguistic reference material) the phrase *in spite of* can be defined as *in disregard or defiance of; notwithstanding*. Rarely does one see a more accurate usage of a colloquialism then in the above legalese. The *in spite of* above refers, of course, to SSFs (separate segregated funds) or, PACs. Political Action Committees are funny things and I am not sure that Mr. and Mrs. America really know what they are and what they do. They are a product of the *but* hidden in the FECs opening statement as noted above. Apparently corporations like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T cannot involve themselves in campaign finance, but the Comcast Political Action Committee, the AT&T Inc. Federal Political Action Committee and the Verizon Communication Inc Good Govt Club can. Maybe I am not as sophisticated as many of those that dwell in the Hall of Power but I would greatly appreciate some clarification on this because I am not seeing the distinction (I consulted dictionary.com and wikipedia to no avail). I will lay that bit of confusion aside and reach for another. <br />
<br />
One might think that a PAC would have a discernable political agenda. As it turns out, believe it or not, this is not necessarily the case. In an effort to ascertain an overt political agenda let us consider the three behemoths mentioned above and how they have exercised the FECs *but*. In the 2005-2006 campaign cycle Comcasts PAC donated to a total of $757,665 to 207 congressional candidates; 98 Democrats and 109 Republicans. AT&Ts PAC donated a total of $1,268,533 to 299 candidates; 115 Democrats and 184 Republicans. Finally, Verizons PAC donated a total of $851,050 for 297 candidates; 122 Democrats and 175 Republicans. Clearly neither Comcast, Verizon nor AT&T recognize party lines. Now, I have always been under the assumption that party lines and politics go hand in hand. Apparently the giants of the telecommunications industry are more interested in fair play then party lines. A level playing field in the game of politics? Again, I might not be as sophisticated as some, but I just cannot believe that. If that were the case why not just keep your money and build a park or two? Maybe lower your service rates a few pennies. The truth is that nobody spends a dime unless they think they are getting a dimeÃ¢??s worth of something in return (preferably a quarters worth, but good luck with that one.). So, obviously, Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and all other PACs feel they are getting something for their money and that something is access. They care nothing for party lines and therefore nothing about politics; they care only about geographic lines, those lines that encompass Washington DC. While candidates are voted into office by the people they do not become candidates without financing. The big picture indicates that big business picks the candidate and leaves the election in our hands. We get to choose which one of their guys gets to the capitol. The money matters more then the vote. What is my effort and my vote worth when faced with the millions of dollars that these corporate PACs can throw behind a hand picked candidate? This *American-style Democracy* has no future. It is up to the party of the people to change this and it looks like the party of the people will wrest a measure of control away from the GOP in the coming weeks. Do we put it out of our misery now and work towards publicly funded campaigns or wait for a future generation to clean up the mess?</div>
