KALIBU ACADEMY - MALAWI


MICHAEL  Means  WHO is LIKE GOD?

MICHAEL KNOWS ISLAM! MUSLIMS!

Sudan:  Kalibu Academy - In the heart of the civil war,
in the midst of war, famine, horrible stories of oppressions,
continual bombings by Khartoum, recent missile attack, there is
ONE place in New Sudan that stands out as a source of hope, a 
lighthouse for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the new Bible School
located in Yei. 

When GOD told Michael to move to Sudan to preach Jesus Christ,
Michael said  "Find sommeone else!"

GOD said ..    "There IS no one else"
so Michael moved to Sudan and started a Bible School

He's won many to the Lord, and has  witnessed MANY miracles.

Michael is a VERY INSPIRING speaker! Powerful  man of GOD.

The TRUTH you DON'T HEAR!

Michael Howard was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Africa. He made his
commitment to the Lord while in high school & shortly before
completing college he decided that his life was to be totally
dedicated to the Lord and to the salvation of souls. He was ordained
under Assemblies of God in Zimbabwe & pastored for 4 years before
moving to Chipinge on the eastern border with Mozambique. It was
there that God gave the vision for a missionary organization and
Shekinah Ministries was birthed in the Spirit. Michael, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, began to operate in the areas where no
others would go. Michael takes his teams to bring life out of death
situations and hope to the helpless. The life and hope that only the
Lord Jesus Christ can bring.

Michael is a fascinating, captivating, and inspiring speaker! 
Someone MUST! make a documentary of this man's experiences, they
are graphic!  He gives personal testimony, his personal experience
of God's miracles in the Sudan!  He deals with muslims and has seen
them saved and filled with Jesus Christ!  Our LORD is REAL to this
man, as Jesus is not this real to most Christians!  

Here is a report, a couple of my brief notes.  I can NOT do justice
to this human dynamo, on whom God's Hand rests!

MICHAEL HOWARD speaking and My comments on what Michael said

Michael lives in the Sudan.  Southern Sudan is not all arab.
The muslims have asked China to come kill all non-muslims in the
south Sudan where Michael's bunch are.  China wants LAND so muslims
will give China a 100 year lease if they get rid of them! 
Michael Howard started a Bible School there, and these guys will
DIE for Jesus Christ!! 

Allah is NOT OUR GOD!!
Allah is a demon prince!  Perhaps the prince of Persia who 
withstood Daniel.  There are 10 million muslims in America.
This means there are 10 million TERRORISTS in our land!

If the leader of Islam declares a jihad (holy war) against the USA,
we will see suicide bombers in America as Israel is experiencing 
now!   Bill Clinton fought on the WRONG SIDE in Kosovo.  He bombed
the christians and saved the muslims and brought terrorists into 
the USA.  Who is responsible?  CNN's Christiana Amanpour, who is 
Iranian, made the Kosovons so pathetic!

NOTE:  June 6, 2001 the arab leaders in the MidEast did
declare the USA an enemy!  Link below.

HOW DO YOU FIGHT ISLAM?? 
They say - You christians are afraid to DIE for Jesus!
 Libya's QUADAFI actually said the ONLY thing he'd fear is 
the Church of Jesus Christ IF it woke up - but it's fast asleep!" 

Muslim soldiers captured Michael saying
"We KILL you!  We KILL you!"  

Michael said 
"You CAN'T kill me, I belong to JESUS!" 
His LACK of fear of death frightened this troup of soldiers, and
he gave each of them a Bible, and they knelt and received Christ 
right there!  PRAISE OUR GOD!  HALLELUJAH!  I want to tell you how
inspiring Michael is, as a speaker! 
God protects them! 

The muslims dropped two bombs right on top of their Bible school!!
Michael watched them fall and said GOD DO SOMETHING! 
God said - hush, I have this under control.  Watch.  I will show
you a miracle.  (God showed many miracles to Michael). 
The bombs headed straight down for the school.  Suddenly one veered
at a right angel to the RIGHT, and the other to the LEFT, both 
fell OUTSIDE the zone, and exploded, leaving the school untouched! 

The Sudanese are afraid of Michael and his people!  They are afraid
of our GOD!  Michael's people drove back n forth across mines, 
none went off, for 3 months.  When a badguy drove across after 
3 months, BOOM!  The word went out DONT TOUCH THESE GUYS! 
GOD is with them!  Several such occurences!

That Sudan 'aspirin factory' did indeed make chemical weapons. 
Every day these chemical bombs are dropped on Sudan, so that
Michael and his students sleep with a wet towel (I think he said)
wrapped around their faces.  The chemicals settle down
around them at night. 

The US is - and must! - stand by Israel.  Islam may well include
America in jihad.  I could go on and on with his stories!

CHRISTIANS  in AMERICA!!  JESUS CHRIST is the SAME!!
YESTERDAY!  TODAY!!  and  FOREVER!!!!!  REMEMBER THIS!

Our HOPE is in the LORD!  Psalm 91 tells us we are safe in Him!

As a believer, you were created not only to influence people for
Jesus as you shared the good news, but also to pray & expect the
power of God to touch their lives when you prayed with them.  It
was the signs and miracles that helped those whom were touched 
understand the awesomeness of God's love & compassion toward them.
It was the heart of compassion, not spiritual pride that led Paul 
to pray and obey and do what Jesus did - preach expecting miracles,
signs and wonders to follow. As Paul obeyed the Lord and expected 
the power of God to follow what He ministered, his faith grew, his
compassion grew, lives were saved, delivered, healed & made whole.

RECKLESSLY ABONDONED
A true story of an ordinary person who believed & obeyed his 
extra-ordinary God.  Set in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) during
the terrorist war, it gives the accounts of miraculous deliverance
from the forces of evil.  "It is a simple matter not only to 
believe in the bigness of a big God, but to obey Him.  There is no
unknown dimension with God, as He is the God of the UNKNOWN.  
All that is required is for us to step out on the water and 
walk with Jesus."

THE PERVERTED GOSPEL
This controversial book looks at the different messages so popular
in Christian circles today.  These seemingly "good" teachings are
becoming "gospels" to the multitudes, when, in fact, their design 
is only to pervert the one True Gospel.  This book will challenge 
you to take a serious look at what you believe and to confirm the 
TRUTH as written in the Word of God.

<img src="church2.jpg">

The PRICE of DISOBEDIENCE
A study on the price paid by a person, people, church or a whole 
nation when they do not obey God's Word.  It is a powerful
exhortation for the Body of Christ in these last days especially 
in America, where the spirit of independence and allegience to 
worldly standards reign.

The author will call you to walk in TRUE freedom.

<b>THIS IS THE JUDGMENT</b>
that the Light has come into the world, 
and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, 
for their deeds were evil.  

GOD so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have
Eternal LIFE. For God did not send his Son into the world
to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

He who believes in Him is not judged;
he who does not believe has been judged already, 
because he has not believed in the name of the only 
begotten Son of God.  John 3:16-19
