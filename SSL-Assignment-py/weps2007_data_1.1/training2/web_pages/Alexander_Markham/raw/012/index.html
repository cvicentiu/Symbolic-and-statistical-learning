    <p>&quot;Superlatives don't do WestWind Airlines true justice. Where to begin? Their web
    site has had over 4 million hits this past year. They operate nearly 2 dozen hubs (in
    North America, Europe, Asia and Australia). They support over 500 pilots. They fly over 2
    dozen aircraft types ranging from Piper Cubs to the Boeing 777-200. Their home page may be
    a bit unwieldy at first, but theirs is a solid, well organized airline offering a supreme
    value to the pilot who wants to enjoy the hobby, from the casual pilot to the dedicated
    simmer. A major airline, but not an unwieldy airline, they offer a wonderful combination
    of activities (fly-ins, contests or something is always going on), diversity (a variety of
    passenger, cargo and charter flights), technical excellence (superior aircraft flight
    models) and humor (they have a &quot;widows club&quot; for their pilots' wives and
    girlfriends!). Add in a policy of logical growth in operations, roster and route
    structure, and WestWind does everything so well! An obvious choice, we're very honored to
    make them the first airline ever to win both the VADU Featured Aircraft of the Week Award
    (1 Mar 1998), and now the latest winner of the VADU Featured Airline Award.
    Congratulations, gentlemen! Fantastic work.&quot; </p>

<p><font color="#800040" size="5"><em><strong>GA Team <a name="2000">2000</a> Recognizes
WestWind...</strong></em></font></p>

<p>The February '98 issue of <em><strong>GA Team 2000 News</strong></em> mailed recently
and WestWind Airlines was prominently featured on its cover -- complete with a web site
screen shot. In an article entitled &quot;A Web of Support,&quot; recognition was given to
WestWind's continuing support of GA Team 2000's campaign to increase non-virtual student
pilot starts. Specifically mentioned, was WestWind's <a
href="Products/BAPClub/bapclub.htm">&quot;Be A Pilot&quot; True Blue Club</a> which lists
the names of WestWind virtual pilots who took advantage of GA Team 2000's $35 introductory
flight and details their impressions of the experience.</p>

<p>The article said...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;One such enthusiastic on-line supporter [of the GA Team 2000 Campaign] is
  WestWind Airlines (www.flywestwind.com). You've heard of fantasy baseball? This is the
  aviation equivalent. WestWind pilots fly virtual aircraft and even develop and manage
  their own virtual airlines. These folks are Flight Simulator whizzes, trading stick and
  rudder software secrets and testing the latest plug-in scenery and aircraft. Most of
  WestWind's subscribers are non-pilots who simply enjoy electronic aviation. But thanks to
  WestWind's enthusiastic promotion of GA Team 2000 through the hard work of Sean Reilly and
  its on-line <a href="Products/BAPClub/bapclub.htm">&quot;Be A Pilot&quot; True Blue Club</a>,
  several have taken $35 introductory flights, and at least two have soloed and are pursuing
  their Private Pilot certificates.&quot;</em></p>

Congratulations to WestWind airlines on their 1 million hits. This is a huge amount of
hits for a Virtual Airline. WestWind is one of the world's largest VA's and it has hubs in
many locations. A good thing about this airline is its fleet diversity, it has a large
fleet of aircraft painted in their colours which is sure to please any Virtual Pilot.</p>
