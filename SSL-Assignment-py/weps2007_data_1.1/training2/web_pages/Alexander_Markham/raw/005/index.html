      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Norman C Nevin (Chairman),<br>

        Dr. Elaine Godfrey (MCA).</font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1. Welcome and Apologies.</b><br>
        The Chairman welcomed four new members to the committee: Professor Alexander 
        Markham at the University of Leeds, Professor David Harrison at the University 
        of Edinburgh, Dr. Andrew Lever at the University of Cambridge and the 
        Reverend Dr. Lee Rayfield, a Church of England Vicar and member of the 
        Society of Ordained Scientists. Apologies had been received from Professors 
        James Neil and Ian Hart, Mr. David Crosby, Ms. Sohaila Rastan, Mrs. Marcia 
        Fry and Dr. Lincoln Tsang. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2. Minutes of 27th Meeting.</b> 
        <br>
        These had been circulated and with minor amendments, were accepted as 
        a true record. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3. Matters Arising.</b> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Adenovirus Working Party.</b><br>
        Following a patient death in an adenoviral gene therapy trial in the USA, 
        a GTAC working party was convened to survey all adenoviral trials in the 
        UK. No evidence of any Severe Adverse Events (SAE's) in UK studies was 
        found. The Working Party gave specific recommendations for appropriate 
        patient monitoring in a minority of studies where the route of administration 
        was the same as that of the US trial. The Working Party report was sent 
        to all GTAC members and will included in GTAC's 6th annual report.</font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>New Guidance.</b> <br>
        The draft Guidance for gene therapy trials was given to members for comment. 
        Members were informed that GTAC had introduced a register to monitor all 
        patients from gene therapy trials, as will as any offspring from those 
        patients up to the age of 16 years. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4. Protocol: A phase I study 
        of Trovax in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</b><br>
        The Chairman summarised the background to members. The protocol received 
        favourable external review, though a number of issues concerning patient 
        participation and information leaflets were raised. Following extensive 
        discussion with the proposers, conditional approval was given subject 
        to a number of amendments to the original protocol. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>5. Protocol: A phase I study 
        of DNA.Mel3 in patients with melanoma</b>. <br>
        The members were given background information for this study. Following 
        favourable external review, conditional approval was given subject to 
        modifications to the patient information leaflets, patient inclusion criteria 
        and requirements for staff protection. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>6. Protocol: A phase I/II 
        study of polyHER2 neu vaccine in the treatment of epithelial cancers</b>. 
        <br>
        The Chairman summarised this protocol. It was suggested that the study 
        should be limited to a more specific patient group and that the proposers 
        might take into account new pharmaceutical treatment, which could be available 
        for this condition. The proposal was rejected by the members. Members 
        agreed that; subject to additional pre-clinical data, more selective inclusion 
        criteria and amendments to the patient information leaflet; a resubmission 
        could be invited. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>7. Protocol: Phase I study 
        of Onyx-015 in bladder cancer.</b> <br>
        Background to this study was discussed by the GTAC. While the protocol 
        had received favourable external review, several issues were raised including 
        the need for approval from HSE and LREC. Conditional approval was given 
        subject to modification of patient information leaflets.</font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>8. Any Other Business.</b> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Approval by Chairman's Action.</b> 
        <br>
        A list of Chairman's actions since the last meeting was tabled for information, 
        including approval for an HIV study. It was agreed that correspondence 
        between the GTAC secretariat and the proposers would be distributed to 
        the members.</font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Change of Membership.</b> 
        <br>
        Letters of thanks had been sent to the exiting members. A letter of thanks 
        from Professor Anthony Dayan was read to members. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Date of Next Meeting.</b><br>
        It was agreed to hold the next meeting on Wednesday, 11 October. The Chairman 
        informed members that the Secretariat would arrange a further half-day 
        meeting to finalise New Guidance for clinical trials. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>. <br>
        <b>All gene therapy is research and recruitment of patients into research 
        trials takes place under strict rules set out by GTAC, under principles 
        elaborated by professional bodies and only after review of clinical protocols 
        by GTAC. </b><br>
