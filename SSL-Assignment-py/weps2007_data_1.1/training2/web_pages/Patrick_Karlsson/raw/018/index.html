									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">By Rip Cook<br>
									Staff reporter<br>
									The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is a large, flightless bird, similar to the ostrich. Scientists believe the Australian native, which can reach up to six feet in height, roamed the Outback some 80 million years ago, making it close kin to the dinosaurs.<br>
									You can imagine, then, the shock of some Shane Creek residents, near Columbus, when they saw an emu strolling on their property last Wednesday.<br>
									The Stillwater County Sheriff's Office was summoned, and the chase was on, with help from Adam Olivas of the Montana Highway Patrol. Upon seeing the emu leap a fence, Deputy Woody Claunch exclaimed that it was a &quot;deer with feathers.&quot;<br>
									Over a police scanner, one officer was heard to say, &quot;I've just spotted an emu, is that the one we're looking for?&quot;<br>
									<br>
									Several officers managed to corner the bird at ranch, where they pushed, pulled, and generally herded it into a barn.<br>
									They were probably lucky that they weren't chasing a cassowary, a close relative of the emu, also from Australia, which has been known to attack humans and disembowel them with their long toe nails.<br>
									An emu rancher from Edgar, about 22 miles away as the crow flies, laid claim to the bird. How it got to Columbus is a mystery.<br>
									According to a story by ABC News, titled, &quot;Emu: It's what's not for dinner,&quot; the birds were originally imported to the United States as breeding stock for zoos. In 1960, Australia implemented an exportation ban on emus, but emu farming using the original zoo stock became popular in the 1980s, and was one of the fastest growing segments of alternative agriculture. Emu meat is low in fat and cholesterol, high in iron and vitamin C.<br>
									Alas, emu steaks are hard to process, and not attractive to the American dining public. According ABC News, membership in the American Emu Association dropped from around 5,500 in 1992 to about 1,000 in 2001. The emu industry has shown sign of recovery, however, as a market has developed for emu oil, which has been shown to relieve arthritis pain, muscle soreness, and joint stiffness, and is used in shampoos, conditioners, and anti-wrinkle cream.</font></p>

										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Lee Dunn and his search dog, Sky, a 7-year-old border collie, from Fishtail, were asked to assist with the recovery of the remains of the seven astronauts who died when the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Earth Feb. 1.<br>
										Dunn and Sky are with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Colorado Task Force One (CO-TF1) and have a Type II canine search specialist certification for disaster search. However, the search for human remains required that Sky also be trained and certified to find a different scent, that of a deceased human.<br>
										To accomplish this, Sky had a training program designed to teach him the difference. &quot;If we are in a disaster, we want these dogs to find live human scents first,&quot; Dunn said. &quot;This discipline must be tested and trained on a regular basis.&quot;<br>
										Sky has a distinctly different way of telling Lee he has found live human scent vs. human remains. &quot;On the live buried human, Sky will bark at the source of the scent and stay there until I climb across the rubble and I am able to identify the spot where searchers can begin extrication,&quot; Lee explained. &quot;Sky will lay down near the scent of human remains and has been taught not to disturb the source.&quot; Lee says. &quot;This different alert is very important because Sky must know the difference and react appropriately. It isn't an easy job, and not every dog makes the grade to disaster certified dog.&quot; FEMA estimates that there is a need for at least three times as many disaster certified dogs to make up for a current shortage. FEMA disaster trained search dog teams with these qualifications are rare in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Idaho. Dunn and Sky have joined CO-TF1, the nearest task force, and travel to Denver on a regular basis for training. Dunn and other search dog handlers are working to add more of these specialty trained canines to this area.<br>
										<br>
										Dunn and Sky are also members of search and rescue in Stillwater County, and comprise a search dog team with Beartooth Search Dogs. The pair volunteers thousands of hours in training, searching and travel to assist others. Through community support and donations Dunn and Sky will be able to continue with this work, Dunn said<br>

									<p><font face="New Century Schlbk" color="#00ced1" size="5"><b>Woes continues at Stillwater Mine </b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Stillwater Mining Co. confirmed that slowed production of platinum and palladium and higher costs at its new mine near Big Timber led to fourth-quarter losses that capped a troubled year for the business.<br>
									The company, which is in the process of selling a majority interest to a Russian metals giant, reported losses of $600,000 for the three months that ended Dec. 31, compared with earnings of $4.9 million during the same period a year earlier.<br>
									The news comes only one week after 200 plus union workers from the Stillwater Mine demonstrated in front of the company's office in Columbus over three days, protesting loss of benefits and the pending sale of controlling interest to a Russian company.<br>
									Just recently in Russian, MMC Norilsk Nickel had to deal with a hunger strike by Russian miners.<br>
									The Columbus-based company said it expected to increase production at its new East Boulder Mine over 2002 levels and aimed to clear regulatory hurdles and gain shareholder approval of its pending deal with MMC Norilsk Nickel.<br>
									As part of a long-range plan focused on cutting costs, the company said it would scale back its overall production goal for palladium and platinum to 615,000 ounces - slightly off the high hit in 2002.<br>
									Expecting lower production and continued operating costs, the company is likely to ask its lenders for changes to its credit agreements, Francis McAllister, the company's chairman and CEO, told shareholders and others in a conference call Tuesday.<br>
									``Our mines and ore reserves are valuable assets,'' he said, adding that new equity and a revamped capital structure will leave the company ``significantly strengthened.''<br>
									Officials see the deal with Norilsk Nickel as being ``in the best interest of the company and stockholders,'' McAllister said.<br>
									Overall in 2002, Stillwater Mining reported earnings of $31.7 million, which compared with $65.8 million the previous year.<br>
									Revenues for the year were $275.6 million, compared with $277.4 million in 2001, the company said.<br>
									Sales, it said, were offset by lower metals prices. John Pearson, investor relations representative, described the year as positive. Platinum and palladium production was up 22 percent from 2001, to a company high of 617,000 ounces, he said.<br>
									Fourth-quarter revenue was $58.6 million, compared with $59.3 million during the same period in 2001. The company attributed the<br>
									dip to costs at East Boulder, lower market prices for metals and lowered production at Stillwater Mine near Nye. The company needed to address such concerns as the noise level of machinery and some equipment was taken out of service, disrupting production and leaving the company short of its production target for the quarter, officials said.<br>

									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">(The following is an enhanced fantasy transcript from Stillwater County&#146;s imaginary talk-radio station, KROK.)<br>
									A-Man: Answer Man here. I&#146;ve got my war paint on, and I&#146;m ready to do battle not only with the despicable despot of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, but also with those bleeding-heart-liberal namby-pambys in our own country protesting the possibility of war! I am ready to bomb, strafe, burn, and otherwise immolate Saddam and his followers! I&#146;m tired of the United Nations dragging this scenario out, I don&#146;t care if there is a lack of evidence that Saddam is manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, the guy is a jerk and deserves to die! Let&#146;s go to the phones!<br>
									Caller: Well, hello there Answer Man, cheers. This is Prime Minister Tony Blair on the trunk line from Great Britain...<br>
									A-Man: Mr. P.M.! What an honor this is, welcome to the show...<br>
									Tony: I&#146;m afraid you&#146;ll have to speak up, A-Man... I have about 200,000 of my bloody constituents outside, complaining about my siding with U.S. policy on Iraq. It&#146;s utter chaos around here!<br>
									A-Man: Well, I did read that something like 70 or 80 percent of your countrymen and women oppose armed conflict in Iraq. Too bad you don&#146;t have the enlightened electorate that we have over here. You&#146;d better start getting them in line, and while you&#146;re at it, you&#146;d better talk to your fellow leaders in France and Germany, and get them on the bandwagon!<br>
									Tony: I know, how very tiresome of them. (Crash!) Oh no, another bloody brick through the window with a note attached. Ho hum, it&#146;s another cartoon characterizing me as George W&#146;s puppet. I can tell you this, there&#146;s no strings attached to my commitment, ha ha. I&#146;ve got to ring off now, A-Man, it&#146;s tea time. Cheers!<br>
									A-Man: Now there&#146;s a man with more guts than brains! No one in England or Europe supports obliterating Iraq, yet he&#146;s still sticking to his guns, despite the fact that it might cost him his job! We could use more like the P.M. here in this country. Next caller.<br>
									Caller: Answer man, hi. It&#146;s Bob McGuire from the KTVQ weather center...<br>
									A-Man: Well, Liar McGuire... what can we do for you today?<br>
									Bob: I just wanted to let everyone know that we&#146;ve developed the new Accu-Terrorist Forecast (tm) system. We can now give a five-day forecast on suicide bombers, biological attacks, holy jihads, etceteras...<br>
									A-Man: Oh really... what&#146;s the current forecast?<br>
									Bob: Let me take a look. Hmmm... uh, you don&#146;t live or work in a high-rise building, do you?<br>
									A-Man: No.<br>
									Bob: Well then, you&#146;re in luck. That&#146;s all the time I have for today. Bye!<br>
									A-Man: What will they think of next? We have a caller on the line from Columbus...<br>
									Caller: Howdy A-Man. I just want to let all the listeners out there know that I&#146;m having a Special Truck-Load Sale on duct tape at the Stillwater County Fairgrounds. Don&#146;t get caught short when that nerve gas cloud is headed your way. Only seven dollars a roll...<br>
									A-Man: Seven dollars? That&#146;s outrageous! I was in Stillwater Hardware the other day, they&#146;re selling duct tape for only $3.29 a roll...<br>
									Caller: That&#146;s before I bought up every roll in the county. We&#146;re currently running an Orange Alert Special... ten rolls for $69.99!<br>
									A-Man: That&#146;s enough free advertising for one day. I just cannot believe that any American would try to profit from terrorism hysteria! Next caller...<br>
									Caller: This is President Saddam Hussein from the Democratic People&#146;s Republic of Iraq...<br>
									A-Man: Get out of here! This must be some sort of crank call...<br>
									Saddam: Do you have caller ID? Check and see what it says...<br>
									A-Man: Hmmm... &#147;Iraqi Presidential Palace Bunker #5.&#148; Well, I guess you&#146;re legit... what does a murderous, human-rights-violating, dogmatic, heathen thug like you want to say to the American listening public?<br>
									Saddam: I just want to dispel all these false accusations. I am a peaceful man, and this is a peaceful country. I&#146;d like to personally invite you and your friends to visit me in Baghdad. I&#146;ll personally give you one of my wives... I mean secretaries... to act as tour guide in our beautiful city. And while you&#146;re here, be sure to stop by Honest Saddam&#146;s Used Car Lot. We have great deals on once-owned Mercedes that we picked up real cheap in Kuwait a few years back...<br>
									A-Man: Do you really expect me to step foot in your country, you dictatorial dog? Peaceful people my eye! What about all those empty missile warheads they found recently over there?<br>
									Saddam: Mere party favors left over from the last attempted coup. We&#146;re saving them to use as fireworks when our American friends come over to visit. We welcome Americans with open arms, especially at McSaddam&#146;s Drive In Restaurants, home of the Curried Goat-Snout Sandwich with Cheese...<br>
									A-Man: I can&#146;t believe I&#146;m hearing this! You represent everything that&#146;s Anti-American and Pro-Evil!<br>
									Saddam: Not true, not true. I embrace everything American, especially whiskey. I&#146;ve got about a thousand cases of Rebel Yell stashed in one of my bunkers, just in case the Great Satan... I mean the United States... decides to go through with these unwarranted attack plans and I have to hide out for a while. Boy, I hope the inspectors don&#146;t check out that bunker!<br>
									A-Man: Whiskey? Isn&#146;t it against your religion to drink liquor?<br>
									Saddam: Oh, right... Inshah Allah! We keep the whiskey for medicinal purposes only, you know, because of the embargo and all. Come on by the bunker, I&#146;ve got a bottle with your name on it...<br>
									A-Man: Well, I&#146;ve got a smart bomb with YOUR name on it! Eat cordite, tyrant! Next caller!<br>
									Caller: A-Man, this is your mother. Who are you fooling with all this war talk? Aren&#146;t you politically slightly left of Jane Fonda?<br>
									A-Man: You know, that might be true, Mom, but who has ever heard of a liberal radio talk show host? That&#146;s all the time we have for this edition of The Answer Man Show. What is YOUR opinion of the pending war with Iraq? Write the Stillwater County News, P.O. Box 659, Columbus, MT, 59019.</font></td>

									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">By Alastair Baker<br>
									News Editor<br>
									This year Red Lodge Mountain has experienced not just a change of mood with the winter but also an overhaul of its eateries; the Bierstube, the restaurant at Mid-way, and the cafeteria.<br>
									The landscape, like the abundant runs found up there, has changed dramatically with the hiring of Michigan-born Jim Watson, and the promotion of Martin Kimmett to bar manager.<br>
									The Beirstube, particularly, has donned a new muilt-colored jacket and now has a personality all of its own, with beverage promotions hanging off the walls and ceilings. It is now smoke-free, and possesses a warmer atmosphere. The menu includes a daily special, plus a special burger, while the bar is planning to serve up to 14 beers on tap, the most anywhere in Red Lodge. The service is now faster and the prices are some of the most reasonable you will find in the town.<br>
									Watson, the Mountain&#146;s new food beverage director, has a food service background, and degrees in hospitality management, and beverage management from colleges in Illinois, and Big Rapids, Mich.<br>
									He started originally at McDonalds, as a manager in training, then general manager before moving to the Red Lobster chain. He worked his way through that management program as well to became a traveling general management that would open up new units in the Great Lakes areas, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.<br>
									Watson was encouraged in the Red Lobster chain to not keep to a set menu, and introduce daily specials.<br>
									&#147;You ran your restaurant like it was your own business,&#148; said Watson, who later went on to run his own outlet, outside that of a corporation, the most recent being the Outlaw Caf&eacute; in Absarokee. He presently lives in the town.<br>
									For Martin Kimmett, the introduction of Watson has been a breath of fresh air, and already the partnership is showing signs of spreading even more fun and belief that they can capture more of the potential restaurant-going public that exists in the area.<br>
									Kimmett is now the bar manager and is grabbing at the opportunities to make changes, with more promotions, a more active bar and continuing with live music on Saturday afternoon and the open air burger bar on the Bierstube deck.<br>
									&#147;What we&#146;d like to do is encourage people to come up here, even if they are not skiers. They can sit and enjoy the view and the food,&#148; said Kimmett.<br>
									&#147;It&#146;s just a great place to spend an afternoon, and have a hamburger and a beer,&#148; supported Watson. &#147;We want to compliment what&#146;s going on.&#148;<br>
									Lunches are served until 3 p.m. while the bar stays open later.<br>
									&#147;We&#146;re trying to create a fun atmosphere, with good service, and decent prices. Being a non-smoking bar has helped,&#148; said Watson.<br>
									For both men it&#146;s time to expand and try new things.<br>
									&#147;You have to be open to change,&#148; said Watson. &#147;You have to try to do something different every day. One of the things that means a lot to me is that we feed a lot of employees on the mountain, and so many come in to the Beirstube and say it&#146;s great to have something that is special and not just something that&#146;s been discounted from the menu,&#148; said Watson.<br>
									&#147;When Rob (Ringer) hired me this fall,&#148; continued Watson, &#147;he said to me &#145;this is what I like you to focus on, here&#146;s the problem with the Bierstube,&#146; and he listed three things, one was speed of service. There are 2,000 people on this mountain and everyone is in a hurry, they&#146;ve paid x-number of dollars for their lift ticket, rentals, the mountain&#146;s only open from 9 a.m. &#150; 4 p.m. and they want to get every minute they can out of the slopes. They don&#146;t want to spend 3 hours in here for lunch.&#148;<br>
									&#147;They all want to eat, and all of them choose between 12 noon and 1:30 p.m.,&#148; said Kimmett.<br>
									&#147;So what you&#146;re doing is feeding a mass of people in a big, big hurry, so one of the things I tried to do with this menu was make it friendly for my cooks. Speed is the essence but it&#146;s also important not make everything you eat come out the deep fat fryer,&#148; said Watson.<br>
									This has led to the menu being a little more skier friendly.<br>
									&#147;The skiers need sustenance, so you give them speed, variety, and puts some carbs in them,&#148; said Watson. &#147;Lets face it, they&#146;re using a lot of energy up here.&#148;<br>
									The menu also includes a variety of salads.<br>
									&#147;Specials are fast and so designed that no lunch menu should take longer than ten minutes,&#148; said Kimmett. &#147;There is no ticket left in the kitchen longer than that.&#148;<br>
									&#147;The result,&#148; said Watson, &#147;you can come in, eat a meal, have a drink, and be back on the mountain in 30-40 minutes. This encourages people to go back in later as well, at the end of the day.&#148;<br>
									Beyond the changes in atmosphere, Watson adds that Kimmett has been &#147;an asset&#148; to the new look.<br>
									&#147;This guy is so friendly he can create an conversation and an instant friend. That rubs off on people and the hired help copy him,&#148; said Watson. &#147;It amazes me how many people know him.&#148;<br>
									&#147;Atmosphere is everything,&#148; stated Kimmett. &#147;There was a couple from Colorado who came through the other day, and said they were looking for an out-of-the-way place, away from the Colorado ski resorts, and found us. They said, &#145;it&#146;s so friendly, so nice here.&#146;&#148;<br>
									&#147;Food wise and menu wise, things change constantly, keeping in mind the focus of what we have done so far. We&#146;ve created a good start,&#148; said Watson. &#147;I love seeing people come in here without ski boots because they&#146;re here for the food.&#148;<br>
									Kimmett is particularly pleased with the idea of increasing the beer stock, and has plans to bring in Sam Adams, to compliment the 7 micro brews, and bottled beers, and as stated earlier, have 14 beers on tap.<br>
									&#147;We&#146;re catering for a variety of different tastes, and it all moves. None of this beer gets stale,&#148; he said.<br>
									For Kimmett &#147;this is the funnest job next to cowboying,&#148; while Watson, in a complative mood, adds, &#147;where else could you come to work, enjoy yourself and then strap on a pair of skis and do some runs for half-an-hour, then come back to work and make new friends?&#148;<br>
									There aren&#146;t a lot of jobs like that in the world they added.<br>
									&#147;We&#146;re trying to have fun and make people&#146;s visit to the Red Lodge Mountain so enjoyable that they will come back,&#148; said Watson..<a name="Anchor-Wyoming-47857"></a></font></p>

										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Absarokee High School junior Luke Oltrogge attended the American Junior Academy of Science annual convention in Denver last week. He won the expense paid trip by placing second in the research paper competition of the Montana Academy of Science in March of 2002.<br>
										Luke&#146;s paper was entitled, &#147;Do Perca flavescens (yellow perch) preferentially use artificial reef structures in Hauser Lake?&#148;<br>
										The AJAS is represented by the nations brightest high school science students. The annual convention is held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which is the publisher of the journal, &#147;Science,&#148; and is one of the premier scientific societies in the country.<br>
										Luke was one of only two students from Montana to attend this convention. There were about 100 students from 25 states in attendance.<br>
										The AJAS delegates made oral and poster presentations of their award winning high school research projects, attended scientific sessions of the AAAS meeting, and toured the University of Colorado or the United States Air Force Academy.<br>
										The poster presentations were at the Colorado Convention Center next to the exhibit hall of the AAAS meeting. As a result, Luke and his poster were visited by many scientists from around the country, and he was able to visit with scientists from NASA, USGS, and other agencies. The students enjoyed &#147;Breakfast with the Scientists,&#148; at which they spent a few informal hours discussing educational opportunities and career objectives with notable scientists. Luke attended lectures by the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics winners Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman, Raymond Orbach of the Department of Energy&#146;s Office of Science, and Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Center.</font></div>
