Molde - Viking 0-0
Att: 3319
Yellow card: Petter Christian Singsaas, Trond Strande, Molde, 
Erik Nevland, Per Blohm, Viking.

- Boring game, with few chances and inept forwards.

Brann - Skeid 4-2 (2-1)
Att: 12 854
0-1 Morten Berre (9)
1-1 Tore André Flo (32)
2-1 Roger Helland (40)
2-2 Berre (55)
3-2 Eirik Skjælaaen (60)
4-2 Kjetil Løvvik (69)

- Skeid surprised for an hour, and could have been a couple of goals
  up at the time. Eventually, though, Brann got their act together
  and the result was the expected home win. Striker Tore Andre Flo
  has signed for Chelsea after his contract expires in October, which
  means that Brann will not get a penny...

Lyn - Haugesund 3-0 (0-0)
Att: 1612
1-0 Knut Nielsen (73)
2-0 Jo Tessem (75)
3-0 Tessem (86)
Yellow card: Rune Nordengen, Lyn.

- A first win for Lyn in a game with an abmysal first half, and
  an improving second half. The home side were the better team
  throughout and the three goals were just reward for their
  efforts.

Lillestrøm - Strømsgodset 0-1 (0-1)
Att: 5898
0-1 Stian Thomassen (og.44).
Yellow card: Ole Einar Martinsen, Stian Thomassen, LSK, Pål 
Skistad, Ousman Nyan, Strømsgodset.

- Strømsgodset continue to surprise, with revelation-of-the-season 
  right wing Olsen in excellent form. First, he had a goal questionally
  called off for offside, then his shot reflected off the post and
  defender Thomassen for the only goal of the game. LSK played one
  of their worst games for some time.

Sogndal - Stabæk 0-3 (0-1)
Att: 1620
0-1 Arild Stavrum (6)
0-2 Stavrum (49)
0-3 Niclas Svensson (75)
Yellow card: Tommy Svindal Larsen, Niclas Svensson, Stabæk.

- The away side were by far the more efficient team and got
  three important goals against newcomers Sogndal.

Tromsø - Bodø/Glimt 2-1 (1-1)
Att: 4230
1-0 Ole Martin Årst (6)
1-1 Bent Inge Johnsen (12)
2-1 Patrick Karlsson (64)
Yellow card: Morten Kræmer, Tromsø, Cato Hansen, Andreas Evjen, 
Ørjan Berg, Bodø/Glimt.

- With over 2 metres (!) of snow still surrounding the ground B/G
  failed to get revenge for the cup final loss last year. In fact,
  the scoreline was exactly the same. Swede Karlsson scored the
  winning goal, although he clearly used his hand (unintentionally?)
  before putting the goal in the net.

Kongsvinger - Rosenborg  2-2 (1-0)
Att: 3813
1-0 Sven Erik Sætre (8)
1-1 Bent Skammelsrud (50)
2-1 Ludwig Erntsson (70)
2-2 Harald Brattbakk (90)
Yellow card: Ludvig Erntsson, Kongsvinger, Bjørn Otto Bragstad, 
Rosenborg.

- RBK continue to struggle, and were only rescued by a last minute 
  equalizer by top scorer Brattbakk. The home team have specialized
  in set pieces and both goals come from freekicks. Not always pretty  
  to watch, but effective. The champions tried to lift their game in
  the second half, but after a bright 10 minutes spell, they fell
  apart and at the moment they are only a shadow of the team which 
  knocked out Milan in the Champions League.
