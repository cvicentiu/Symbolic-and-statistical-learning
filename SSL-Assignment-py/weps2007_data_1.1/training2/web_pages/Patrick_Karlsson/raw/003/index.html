Hi,

This is a question about hypothesis testing (I think).

Place n two colored dots randomly in two dimensions x and y. E.g., first
randomly place a red dot, then a green, then a red, and so on until all
n dots are placed. For every dot we then look at the nearest neighbor
(euclidean metric) to see what color it is. Assume that a dot can only
have one nearest neighbor. We are left with a vector v of length n,
where the elements v_i are 0 (red) or 1 (green) depending on the nearest
neighbor color of dot i.

Given a vector v, how can I test for randomness of the color of the
nearest neighbors?

At first glance I just performed a Chi2 test (1 d.f. and significance
0.05), with the hypothesis that p_red=0.5 and p_green=0.5. It said that
I could not reject the hypothesis. But ...

... are the samples (elements of v) really independent. Couldn't one
reason that if dot v_i's nearest neighbor is v_j, then v_j's nearest
neighbor probably is v_i. Wouldn't this (suggested) relationship point
to a depency between dots?

If it isn't already obvious, statitistics isn't my field of expertise,
so I would be truly happy if somebody could tell me how I should try to
solve this problem.

PS. Please tell me if my problem description is unclear, and I will try
to improve it.
