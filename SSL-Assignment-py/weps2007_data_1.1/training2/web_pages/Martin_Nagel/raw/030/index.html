	<P><B>Martin Nagel, President of GLASSTEC 2002 trade fair&amp;Master of the German Glass Craft Guild
Our trade fair will create an atmosphere in which people believe that we are about to turn the corner</B></P>
	<BODY><font face="Times">The 17th GLASSTEC international trade fair of the glass industry, to be held from 28 October to 1 November in D&#252;sseldorf promises to be a clear indication that the industry is about to see an upturn. In the opinion of those involved with the glass market and economic researchers the atmosphere of despondency still prevailing in Germany will have been largely dispelled in the run-up to GLASSTEC 2002. The first faint indications of a general improvement in the business climate are clearly discernible. The well-known market research organisation, Ifo-Institut, from Munich has recorded the beginning of an economic recovery.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">Nevertheless, in contrast to the other countries in Europe, Germany will not take down its warning light in the labour market. Even after GLASSTEC 2002 the number of unemployed in Germany will be more than 4 million. The disparity between the level of activity in the markets in eastern and western Germany will continue and in the future this will have a greater affect on the construction industry than any other businesses. It can be anticipated that the construction industry will continue to be confronted by serious difficulties. The current disputes concerning collective bargaining leave little room for optimism. And this presents the glass industry with the question as to what effect the situation in the construction industry will have, or already has had, on the German glass industry particularly on window making. In the meanwhile the manufacturing industries and the wholesale trade have reported that there has been a significant change in the atmosphere. It is said that people are looking forward to the future with confidence, although the weakness of the US dollar means that it is not fuelling of the engine of European exports. It is those exports which power the economies in Europe.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">As President of GLASSTEC 2002, I have no doubt, in-spite of the dichotomy presented by the economic situation and the not always encouraging data from the German domestic market, that our industry does have a future. Above all, I rely on the development and creativity of the small and medium sized businesses with their skilled tradesmen, which are an enormous assets in terms of their power of innovation, an asset which will in the end pay for itself. That is why I am certain that in the coming October our trade fair will help give rise to a new mood that we are about to turn the corner, an atmosphere that is not to be underestimated. Above all else, the fair will give the German glass industry a new and motivational boost.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">We shall not blast out of this recession like a rocket taking off. The collapse into "the valley of tears" has been far too deep and has been accompanied by too many adverse consequences for many companies in the glass industry. Little assistance was offered to help companies overcome the effects of the recession where significant assistance could have been expected from official policy particularly from a German government which had the much-quoted authority to decide on economic policy. It is to be hoped that following the elections to the Bundestag, or lower house of the German Parliament &#150; which will have been held one month before GLASSTEC 2002 &#150; the politicians will at least become aware of the reasons why they have been elected. And consequently, in their role as highly-paid representatives of the people, they will do something worthwhile in the interests of the electorate, which includes the craftsmen working in the glass industry. The importance of GLASSTEC 2002 in providing the first indicator following the elections of German economic confidence within what is a key industry, in which craftsmen, trade and industry work together as a team to produce results, should not be under estimated.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">As well as being President of GLASSTEC 2002, I am also Master of the German Glass Craft Guild. The Guild was responsible for first setting up this trade fair more than 30 years ago. The fair has subsequently developed using its own resources and creativity. As a man with hands-on experience, I know very well how the current situation in the market not only renders the turnover and profit estimates useless, but most importantly, it can paralyse creativity within businesses. In addition to this we are living in an age in which it is difficult for young people more than anybody else to start up a company, all the more since banks and other lenders are more reticent in granting financial assistance than they have been in the past. It is no longer a seldom occurrence for them to call in lines of credit without justification. Visions, ideas, new product developments are not taken into account when financial assistance is being granted. They are not regarded as plus points in the credit rating allocated by bankers with a fixation on the bottom line.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">Nevertheless, it is precisely to these young master craftsmen and to those entrepreneurs starting up companies that GLASSTEC 2002 will convey ideas sparking off visions and demonstrating the technological scope pointing the way forward far into the new Millennium. "GLASS TECHNOLOGY LIVE" &#150; a special show and symposium &#150; will inject an input of new ideas into companies. At Glasstec 2002 many things will be pointed out, which can and ought to be put into practice. Loads of them. Added to which there is the personal contact with colleagues, companies, suppliers to the business and potential customers, scientists, and last but not least, representatives of the supplier responsible for providing the company stand.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">We, that is the German Glass Craft Guild, will have many businesses, training organisations and institutes displaying the versatility of what we can do on more than 1000 m? of exhibition floor space in Hall 9. This will be reason enough to visit us, to talk with us, to discuss matters with us, to make appointments with us. We have much to offer. We can help you with regard to PR and marketing issues as well. We can solve your problems such as: How do I present my company? How can I gain new customers?&#160;<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">Some months ago we pointed out, not without some pride, that GLASSTEC 2002 will be the first major trade fair for the glass industry in the age of the Euro. Only it did not occur to us, and we did not want to be confronted with the mutation of the Euro into the Expensive Euro. Profiteers throughout Europe took advantage of the currency conversion over to the Euro to make a fast buck. What has happened is precisely that which the politicians tried to tell us would not happen. In Germany almost 60 percent want to have the Deutsche Mark back. The figure for those in France for whom the euphoria has worn off within six months is not much less.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">I do not want to be carried away with the general price hysteria, which is in the final analysis, not least also caused by the forthcoming elections in Germany. We have to get back to a cost-benefit ratio which is reasonable from all sides. There is no doubt that the Euro has also resulted in identifiable price increases in our line of business, above all for the many different basic materials supplied to the industry. In the final analysis those companies, who are forced to buy in materials at a higher price will inevitably be forced to pass on at least some of the price increase to their customers. The new currency is also forcing businesses in our industry to be careful with pricing and to adopt a wait-and-see response.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">I am certain that in October following the excitement of the elections we shall have become logical and will be adopting a reasonable approach again. In the final analysis GLASSTEC is an international trade fair and we should not be carried away by the short-term internal political pre-occupation of the host country.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">We in the glass industry brought this splendid trade fair into life more than three decades ago here in D&#252;sseldorf with just a few exhibitors. In spite of all the difficulties and economic ups and downs it has developed into what it has become today, more than simply a barometer of atmosphere in the glass industry, it is an indicator with international significance. It is more than an impressive show of what the trade, commerce and industry can do with glass as a material. For many years the large operations and small craft business have successfully worked together and have proved how an industry can merge seamlessly and can function in spite of having businesses of different sizes and with different tasks. And the industry is able to do so without losing its identity.<br clear="all"/></font><br> 	<font face="Times">The only thing required is the will to work together and the willingness to demonstrate this on an international basis in all its manifold aspects. That is why you should be there at GLASSTEC 2002.</font> </BODY>
