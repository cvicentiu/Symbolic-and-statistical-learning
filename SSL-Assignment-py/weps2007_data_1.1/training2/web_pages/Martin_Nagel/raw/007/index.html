Intended Audience

This course is directed to high-level executives, middle-level 
managers and technical leaders who are responsible for human-
computer interfaces.  This includes policy makers who select 
commercially available interfaces for their organization, and 
those who develop new interfaces for internal use or for sale.   
Evaluators, trainers, marketers, office managers, and executives 
in technology intensive organizations will also benefit from this 
program.

Prerequisites

Knowledge of and management experience with user interfaces on 
personal computers, workstations, or mainframes.  

Benefits

This Executive Overview will give you a state-of-the-art report on 
managing user interface development and deployment.  You will learn 
about contemporary management methods that make dramatic differences 
in project outcomes.

Description

Successful managers recognize a grand opportunity to dramatically 
alter computer-oriented workplaces with contemporary Graphic User 
Interfaces, e.g. Macintosh, MS Windows 3.0, OSF/Motif, NeXT, etc.  
The business case is clear: improved interfaces can substantially 
increase productivity and quality, reduce stress, fatigue, and 
errors, and enable users to generate creative solutions to their 
problems.

	This program combines scientific management approaches to 
project planning and evaluation.  We explore how management 
policies and design improvements can have powerful effects on user 
learning times, speed of performance on tasks, rate of errors, 
subjective satisfaction, and human retention over time.  Usability 
laboratory testing, guidelines documents, and user interface 
management software tools are now seen as the three pillars of 
successful user interface projects.  

	New designs offer intriguing breakthroughs in information 
visualization, image processing, search strategies, direct 
manipulation interactions, and user-controlled adaptation, but 
concerns about intellectual property (copyright & patents) and 
privacy protection raise new challenges for management.

	Software interfaces enable mangers to restructure workplaces 
through computer supported cooperation, electronic mail, bulletin 
boards, group decision support, electronic meeting systems, and 
shared databases.  Hardware advances contribute through high-
resolution displays, notebooks with styli, high-precision 
touchscreens, high-bandwidth networks, and parallel computation.
