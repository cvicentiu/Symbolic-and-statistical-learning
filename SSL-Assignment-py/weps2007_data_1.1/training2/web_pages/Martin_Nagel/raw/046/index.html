        Nick Price won his second Nedbank Million Dollar
        Challenge title at the casino resort yesterday in a
        nailbiting finish.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">Price
        edged home at the Gary Player Country Club course by a
        single shot from local hero Ernie Els and USPGA champion
        Davis Love, with Californian left-hander Phil Mickelson,
        who led for most of the tournament, faltering in the
        closing stages to end up two back in fourth place.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">Price
        closed with the sort of round he wanted, an almost
        flawless 68 that included five birdies and only one
        dropped shot.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">That
        gave him a 72-hole total of 13-under-par 275, one better
        than Els and Love who closed with 67s, and two better
        than Mickelson who slipped to a 73.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">The
        tension reached a peak on the 18th green. Price, just
        over the green with his second, watched in horror as the
        ball skidded off his wedge and ran more than 3m past the
        hole.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">Els
        then thrilled the huge gallery by sinking a 20m putt
        which snaked across the green and into the cup. That put
        him level with Love, one behind Price, and a four-way
        play-off looked possible with Price facing a tricky putt
        and Mickelson still playing the 16th.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">Price
        said he had felt before teeing off he would need to get
        to 14-under to have a chance of winning, but Mickelson
        had let the others in after his double-bogey at the
        eighth.</font> </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">South

        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">&quot;We

        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">Having
        had the Kiwis struggling on 93 for five, however, the

        <p><font size="2" face="Times, Times Roman, serif">The
