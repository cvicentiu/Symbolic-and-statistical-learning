<p class="title">Welcome to Grace Covenant Fellowship!</p>

<p>
Greetings! Grace Covenant Fellowship (GCF) is the English-speaking ministry of the Korean United Church of Philadelphia. We are a church committed to glorifying God by proclaiming Jesus Christ as the way, the truth, and the life. We believe God’s church is established on earth to bring people to Christ , with the goal of leading them to become His disciples.  While recognizing our linguistic, cultural, and in some cases ethnic differences, we see ourselves as one church. Hence, the overall vision of the church is common, while applying that vision may vary according to our distinct needs and gifts. We welcome you to browse our site to find out more about our ministry. We also invite you to join us for Sunday Worship.We hope you and your family come to find GCF as a comfortable and vivid place to worship, grow, and call your home. <br><br>

<b>7|4|04  SENDING FORTH OUR SENIOR PASTOR</b><br><br>
<img src="sendoff.jpg"><br><br>
With both sadness and joy, sadness in having to say goodbye and joy in knowing that God will bless so many through the Kim family as we have been blessed, KUCP and GCF celebrated Pastor Daniel Kim's send off this past Sunday with delicious food and cake. With faith, we ask God to bless Pastor Kim and his wife and children as they are called to Sarang Church in California to serve God's kingdom. We will miss you all! <br><br><br>


<b>6|1|04  A JOYFUL WELCOME</b><br><br>

Praise God! GCF is so blessed to finally welcome our new EM Pastor and his family. Pastor Alex Choi, his dear wife Michelle and three beautiful children are God's gracious answer to our many prayers. We are all filled with such thankfulness, joy and hope in how our Lord will lead us through this dear family. <br><br><br>
