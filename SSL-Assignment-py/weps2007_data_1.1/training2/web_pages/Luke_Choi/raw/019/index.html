        with prayer by the Moderator. The meeting was organized around the theme 
        of &#8220;The maintenance of divine worship,&#8221; one of the great ends 
        of the church, as stated in the Book of Order: &#8220;All power in heaven 
        and earth is given to Jesus Christ by Almighty God,...Christ calls the 
        Church into being, giving it all that is necessary for its mission to 
        the world,...The great ends of the church are the proclamation of the 
        gospel for the salvation of humankind; the shelter, nurture, and spiritual 
        fellowship of the children of God; the maintenance of divine worship; 
        the preservation of the truth; the promotion of social righteousness; 
        and the exhibition of the Kingdom of Heaven to the world.&#8221;</p>

      <p><strong>Peacemaking Resource Team</strong><br>
        Speaking for the resource team, the Rev. Ms. Julia Sheetz-Willard and 
        the Rev. Ms. Bernice Warren presented the following resolution, which 
        the Presbytery approved:</p>
      <p align="center"> <strong>Resolution on Haiti</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> Escalating violence and political unrest in 
        Haiti in recent months has led to an increasing number of persons fleeing 
        in search of refuge, often to the United States in crowded and unsafe 
        vessels;</p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> In February alone more than 100 people were 
        killed and 867 Haitians were repatriated by the U.S. Coast Guard without 
        having an opportunity to adequately state their claims for political asylum;</p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> The Presbyterian Church (USA) stands in prayer 
        with and for our Haitian brothers and sisters who secured their freedom 
        from slavery 200 years ago and thus encouraged others held captive to 
        follow their example;</p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> During an earlier similar Haitian humanitarian 
        and political crisis, the 204th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church 
        (USA) in 1992 issued a statement calling on the president and United States 
        government to &#8220;suspend immediately the high seas interdiction and 
        forced return of Haitian refugees&#8221;;</p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> The 1951 UN Convention on Refugees and the 
        1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, to which the United 
        States is a signatory, provide for the protection of persons seeking refuge 
        and political asylum;</p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> President Bush on February 25, 2004, stated 
        that &#8220;we will turn back any refugee that attempts to reach our shore,&#8221; 
        a policy in clear violation of the UN Convention on Refugees and the 1967 
        Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees; </p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> The Temporary Protected Status program was 
        established by Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide 
        protection to people who are temporarily unable to return to their homelands 
        because of dangerous and ongoing conflict; and </p>
      <p><strong>Whereas:</strong> An international consensus that this is the 
        current situation in Haiti is made clear by the decision of the UN Security 
        Council to provide peacekeeping forces to the region, forces that include 
        elements from the United States;<br>
        <strong>Therefore Be It Resolved That:</strong> The Presbytery of Philadelphia 
        go on record as thanking the President of the United States for contributing 
        troops to the international peacekeeping force in Haiti so that the country 
        can be stabilized, and urging him to provide protection for all Haitians 
        intercepted at sea and to offer to Haitians currently residing in the 
        United States Temporary Protected Status for a period of 18 months.</p>
      <p><strong>Be It Resolved Further That:</strong> Secretary of Homeland Security 
        Tom Ridge be requested to immediately halt all deportations and repatriations 
        to Haiti because of the instability of that country and the almost assured 
        threat to the lives of all Haitians returned to the island at this time.</p>
      <p><strong>The Presbytery Instructs the Stated Clerk</strong> to forward 
        a copy of this resolution to President Bush, Secretary of State Colin 
        Powell, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, members of Congress 
        representing the four-county area covered by the Presbytery of Philadelphia, 
        any relevant media, and to the churches of the Presbytery, encouraging 
        them to share it with their members.</p>
      <p><strong>New Business</strong> The Stated Clerk was previously notified 
        of an overture to the Presbytery from the Oreland Church, with the concurrence 
        of the Bethany Collegiate, Elkins Park, and Olivet Covenant Churches. 
        The text of this overture is Attachment D. The sponsoring church&#8217;s 
        Pastor, the Rev. Dr. Jim A. Farrell, was given an opportunity to speak 
        to the Presbytery concerning the overture&#8217;s rationale. Thereafter, 
        the Presbytery voted to refer the overture to the Council, as required 
        by <em>Bylaws</em> &sect; 4.2(d), with the instruction that the Council 
        report its recommendations at the September 28, 2004 stated meeting of 
        the Presbytery.</p>
      <p><strong>Attendance Report</strong> Elder officers, former moderators, 
        committee moderators and executive staff 19, elder commissioners 119, 
        total elders 138; minister members 169; visitors 18; total attendance 
        325. The offering, dedicated to the Care of Ministers Fund, was $1,270.56.</p>
      <p><strong>Benediction and Adjournment</strong> There being no further business 
        to come before the meeting, the meeting was adjourned at 8:55 p.m. with 
        the recession of the symbols of our faith and a benediction by the Moderator. 
        The Presbytery will meet again in a stated meeting on July 27, 2004 at 
        10:00 a.m. at the Crossroads Presbyterian Church, 10 West Cherry Lane, 
        Limerick, Pennsylvania.</p>

      <p>At its meeting on May 6, 2004 meeting, the committee:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Noting that all AA/EEO requirements have been met, granted permission 
          to Candidate Anne Clark-Duncan (Wayne) to candidate to be Pastor of 
          the Beverly Hills Church on May 16, 2004 and, as the way becomes clear, 
          recommended that the Presbytery examine her for ordination at its stated 
          meeting on May 25, 2004, and approved her reception as a member of the 
          Presbytery following her ordination that she may take up her work effective 
          June 5, 2004 on stated terms of call, based on one-half time.</li>

          to Candidate Mark Studer (Presbytery of Sacramento) to candidate to 
          be Associate Pastor of the Media Church on May 23, 2004, and, as the 
          way becomes clear, recommended that the Presbytery examine him for ordination 
          at its stated meeting on May 25, 2004, and approved his reception as 
          a member of the Presbytery following his ordination that he may take 
          up his work effective June 15, 2004 on stated terms of call.</li>
        <li>Concurred in the request of the Rev. Dr. Eugene C. Bay and the Bryn 
          Mawr Church for dissolution of the Pastoral relationship, effective 
          October 3, 2004.</li>
        <li>Concurred in the recommendation that the regular Committee meeting 
          in September 2004 be held on September 9, 2004 to avoid conflict with 
          the Labor Day holiday. The Leadership Team will meet September 7.</li>
        <li>Concurred in the request of the Rev. Mr. Clyde Griffith and Christ 
          Church that his status be changed to correct a prior misinterpretation

          effective June 1, 2004.</li>
        <li>Approved Church Information Forms for the First African Church and

        <li>Approved Parish Associate relationships between the Wallingford Church 
          and the Rev. Mr. J. Barrie Shepherd and the Rev. Ms. Jeanne Thomas.<br>
          The committee calls attention to the fact that the Presbytery&#8217;s 
          minimum terms of call allow cumulation of study leave allowance and 
          time for up to three years. Although it is preferable for study leave 
          be taken annually, it is recognized that it may be necessary to have 
          a larger block of time available for a particular continuing education 
          activity by cumulating time from several years. Ministers should always 
          keep the session advised of study leave plans.</li>

        G-14.0310. After hearing his statement of faith, the committee questioned 
        him on it, his sermon, and his Biblical exegesis. The committee then found 
        him ready for examination for ordination, pending a call.</p>

      <p align="center"> <strong>GUIDELINES FOR ALTERNATE EXAMINATION<br>
        OF CANDIDATES</strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The Book of Order states: (G-4.0403; Full Participation) &#8220;The Presbyterian 
        Church (U.S.A.) Shall give full expression to the rich diversity within 
        its membership, and shall provide means which will assure a greater inclusiveness 
        leading to wholeness in its emerging life. Persons of all racial ethnic 
        groups, different ages, both sexes, <strong>various disabilities</strong>,...shall 
        be guaranteed full participation and access to representation in the decision 
        making of the church.&#8221;</p>
      <p>In light of these obligations our goal is to present a procedure for 
        reviewing and assessing those inquirers and candidates under our care 
        who have disabilities.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia Presbytery encourages all its candidates to complete all 
        ordination requirements set out in the Book of Order. Where disabilities 
        make it difficult or impossible to do so the Committee on Preparation 
        for Ministry will seek means to enable them to do so. For example, it 
        will provide access to extra tutoring, extra course work, mentoring opportunities, 
        advocacy, etc.</p>
      <p>The following may ensue, after a second failure to pass any of the examinations, 
        if these conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> The difficulty has nothing to do with any inability to understand 
          the content of the subject matter.</li>
        <li> The candidate is otherwise ready to receive a call.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Committee on Preparation for Ministry (&#8220;CPM&#8221;) may consider 
        an exception to the requirements of the Book of Order for the successful 
        completion of the ordination examinations. In the event such a motion 
        is voted on in the affirmative, the following procedure will take place:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> CPM will establish a resource team which will include as a minimum 
          a seminary professor, member of Presbytery experienced in grading Standard 
          Ordination Examinations, and the advocate.</li>
        <li>The resource team will devise an adequate test, which may be a written 
          examination, an oral examination, or a paper to be prepared.</li>
        <li>The advocate will meet with the student to discuss the type and nature 
          of the examination, as well as the date, time and place at which it 
          will be administered, or the date on which the paper is to be submitted. 
          The candidate will also be required to provide written permission for 
          all parties involved, including all members of the CPM, to evaluate 
          the examination and/or paper.</li>
        <li>A member of the resource team will proctor the examination, or receive 
          the written paper, convene the resource team to evaluate the result, 
          and then report to CPM.</li>
        <li>CPM will decide by three-fourths vote, in the absence of the candidate, 
          as to whether to petition the Presbytery to make the exception (which 
          will require a three-fourths vote of the Presbytery). It is appropriate 
          for CPM to interview the candidate on the subject if deemed necessary.</li>
        <li>If the Presbytery approves the recommendation of CPM, the minutes 
          of Presbytery will reflect the reasons for making the exception, and 
          the alternative method of examination used.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> For the Bible content examination, CPM will develop a testing procedure 
        in the following manner:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Ask the Examination Office of the PC (USA) to provide a proctored 
          examination at the inquirer&#8217;s or candidate&#8217;s seminary, with 
          special provisions as approved by CPM such as oral responses, unlimited 
          time with breaks, circle the answers in the exam rather than the answer 
          sheet <br>
          or<br>
          Ask the Examination Office to furnish CPM with an examination which 
          will be proctored and graded by the advocate with the same provisions 
          as above.</li>
        <li>CPM will report the test score to the Examination Office and the test 
          will become a permanent part of the inquirer&#8217;s or candidate&#8217;s 
          file.</li>
        <li>Proceed to steps 5 and 6 of the above procedure to ascertain the Presbytery&#8217;s 
          willingness to make an exception.</li>
      </ol>
