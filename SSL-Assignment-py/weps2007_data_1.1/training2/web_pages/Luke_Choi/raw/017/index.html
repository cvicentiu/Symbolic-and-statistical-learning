<B> Best Restaurant:</B> <I> Margot Caf&#233; and Bar</I> Not just the best new restaurant in Nashville, but the best restaurant, period. The vibrant, open dining room is at once warm and urban, without feeling the slightest bit trendy. And the food is absolutely fantastic, thanks to owner/chef Margot McCormack's insistence on the freshest ingredients. The menu changes daily, which means that each visit offers a whole new set of delights, all prepared with skill, care and attention to detail, yet with beautiful, striking simplicity. Beyond that, though, there's an utterly appealing vibe about the place; the cheerful staff all clearly enjoy working with each other, and that geniality spills over to the customers. Special mention goes to the mind-blowingly great desserts; one of Nashville's best waiters, John Michael (also a server at Caffe Nonna); and perhaps the coolest bartender anywhere, Veta Cicolello.

<B> Best New Ethnic Restaurant: <I> Horn of Africa</I> </B> Several years ago, local chowhounds--fans of inexpensive, far-flung ethnic food--were thrilled at the arrival of Addis Ababa, Nashville's first Ethiopian restaurant. But after the original owners, Gizachew Tesfaye and Esayase Abebe, sold the business, the food went downhill quickly. Chowhounds will be happy to know that there's another Ethiopian eatery in town, in a strip center at the intersection of Murfreesboro Road and Thompson Lane. Best of all, Tesfaye is the owner. Fans of Ethiopian fare can once again satisfy their urge for a rich, pungent bowl of <I>wat</I>, and those who've never tried the food can visit Horn of Africa knowing they're getting the real thing.

<B> Best Thai Restaurant: <I> Jasmine</I> </B> Nashvillians can thank chef Bobby Korsuwan and his wife's family, the Silpacharns, for bringing the delectable delights of Thai food to our city. Notable on Korsuwan's r&#233;sum&#233; are Orchid (which he opened, then sold) and Siam Cuisine on White Bridge Road, which he opened with the Silpacharns. Still, he hungered for a new challenge. So with the idea of creating a fine-dining Thai experience, he spent six months under classically trained French chef Emil LaBrousse at Magnolia in Franklin. Certainly, Jasmine, which Korsuwan opened in early 2001, should have been an instant hit, thanks to his undeniable skills, his track record and his cadre of fans. Except for one little thing: Jasmine is in Cool Springs, the epicenter of every chain and fast-food restaurant in America. While herds of Williamson Countians wait up to two hours for a plate of fuel at Cozymel, Applebee's and Outback, Bobby pleases more discerning and adventurous palates with exquisitely executed Thai classics, as well as some intriguing French-Asian fusion dishes. The best Thai food in Nashville is just 10 miles south of town, and well worth the drive.

<B> Best Restaurant in Franklin:<I> Saffire</I> </B> Through his TomKats catering company, Tom Morales has fed some of the biggest names (and most demanding eaters) on stage and screen. Having achieved success on the road, Morales longed to bring it all home to Williamson County, which he believes is woefully lacking in exciting, creative dining opportunities. Chef Scott Alderson, whose talents have long been enjoyed by Middle Tennesseans vacationing in his Seaside-Sea Grove-Grayton Beach, Fla., stomping grounds, moved to Nashville to open the ill-fated 6&#186;. Though the restaurant failed, Alderson succeeded in making a memorable impression on local foodies. Morales recruited Alderson, and the two have taken over the Bluewind space in the Factory at Franklin, renaming it Saffire. A raw bar with oysters, sashimi, sushi, ceviche and carpaccios; a California-style open kitchen; a wood-burning pit to slow-roast meats; and a wood-burning grill are encouraging indicators of Saffire's sparkling potential and promise.

<B> Best Family Restaurant: <I> Bobbie's Dairy Dip</I> </B> Situated along a nondescript stretch of Charlotte Avenue in West Nashville, Bobbie's may be the most intergenerational joint in town. To folks of a certain age, a trip to Bobbie's brings back fond memories of warm, lazy evenings, eating grilled-to-order burgers outside or in your car and trying to lick the ice cream from your cone before it all melts. For those too young to remember, Bobbie's has introduced a whole new generation to the simple pleasures of a summer night. The place is not a throwback; it's a never-left. It's authentically old-time, down to its seasonal schedule. When Bobbie's opens each spring after a long winter hibernation, you just smile, knowing school will soon be over and those unhurried, endless evenings have almost arrived.

<B> Best Dining Development: <I> Neighborhood Restaurants</I> </B> How do neighborhoods differ from subdivisions? Subdivisions have houses with two-car garages, decks in the back and manicured lawns that border the roads. Neighborhoods have houses with front porches, yards and sidewalks. Hopefully, those sidewalks offer an easy walk to the market, the dry cleaner, the post office, the bakery, the coffee shop and the bistro. Neighborhoods also decline when services leave. Often the first service to reclaim a corner or a block, and eventually the neighborhood, is an independent restaurant. Hillsboro Village is the most notable and successful example of what is possible: Sunset Grill, The Trace, Boscos, Fido, Provence, Jackson's, Sam's, and most recently, Easy's offer a hotbed of commerce and nightlife within walking distance of a mix of residential options. Other areas are taking their lead: Caffe Nonna, Portland Brew and Park Caf&#233; in Sylvan Park; Mirror, Las Paletas, and another Portland Brew forge new ground in 12 South; and East Nashville is bubbling over with BJRC, Slow Bar, Margot Cafe and Bar, Woodland Cafe (in the ground-breaking Sasso location), Rosepepper Cantina and several more on the drawing board.

<B> Best Comeback: <I> Belle Meade Brasserie</I> </B> There are few things sadder than athletes, entertainers, models or restaurants that are yesterday's news. Comebacks are tough, and more often than not, they meet with resounding yawns. About the only thing harder than opening a new restaurant is turning one around that has gone stale. When it opened in 1988, Belle Meade Brasserie was a breath of fresh air: inventive fare from young chefs, a lively, fun atmosphere, and caring personal service. But after 10 years of the same-old same-old, the neighborhood restaurant was just plain tired. Credit owner Mark Rubin for providing the wake-up call it needed. First, he moved a couple of blocks away, still in the 'hood but in warm, elegant, classy new digs. Then he revamped the menu and gave energetic young chef Matthew Dudney a free hand in the kitchen. Finally, he kept what wasn't broke: general manager Michael Johnson, who knows your name, your drink and how you like your steak. Belle Meade Brasserie is now back on its game, and scoring points again in the biz.

<B>Best Room With a View: <I> Latitude</I> </B> The brand-new Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University might offer the city something that is in short supply, particularly with the recent closing of Capitol Grill: a hotel restaurant that attracts local diners. The menu of fresh seafood is promising: lobster ravioli with saffron-chervil sauce; she-crab soup; lemon-ginger mahi mahi with grilled sea scallops. In even shorter supply in a city rife with strip-center restaurants are rooms with a view. On the second floor of the hotel, with plenty of floor-to-ceiling windows, Latitude offers free sightseeing with lunch and dinner. Of course, it depends on your vantage point. One angle overlooks Centennial Park and the gorgeously lit, recently renovated Parthenon. Another gazes upon Dudley Field--which, come football season, may be enough to take away one's appetite.

<B>Best Outdoor Dining: <I>Park Caf&#233; </I></B>While Nashville enjoys a lengthier outdoor dining season than our friends above the Mason-Dixon--if you can stand the humidity, the mosquitoes, the exhaust fumes and the pollen--it is typically not a 12-month venture. But Park Caf&#233;'s pretty little secluded patio is so popular that regular diners frequently request that their black sesame seared scallops, crawfish tail salad, and roasted mahi mahi be served al fresco, even in the dead of winter. Chef/owner Willie Thomas complies, thanks to heat stands and roll-down sides in January, fans in July, and a protective roof all year long.

<B>Best Bar: <I>The Palm One</I></B> Saturday, I took my wife and two children to an early afternoon basketball game at the Gaylord Entertainment Center. When it ended, I steered the family toward the bar at The Palm. It was a shade shy of cocktail hour--5 o'clock--but I was a thirsty guy.  "Honey," I pleaded,  "how about we just run in The Palm for an early drinky-poo. The kids can have Sprites." Laura Lee started acting like one of those nosy reporters people talk about.  "What is it about that place--you're there all the time!" she exclaimed.  "Honey," I swore,  "I've only been there at most a couple of times." So the wife, the kids and I strolled into the glorious bar--at which point the bartender looked up and boomed out,  "Hey Bruce, howyadoin?" Under normal circumstances, when the bartender knows your name, it's enough to declare the place your new summer home. Today, though, my wife's left eyebrow was a veritable Gateway Arch. Luckily, I had a defense. At The Palm, according to reliable sources, bar personnel are instructed never to forget a name. Even if you only go there once. It's a trademark of the world's finest drinking establishments. Since that visit, I have returned, oh, a couple of times. At least that's what I tell Laura Lee.

You'll get all the fancy accoutrements--linens, silver, fine china, polished service and chef Jason McConnell's fabulous fare--but in a more casual setting, without the long-term commitment a reservation requires.

<B> Best Pub:<I> Sherlock Holmes Pub</I> </B> The Sherlock Holmes Pub, 2206 Elliston Place, is aptly named: It takes a bit of deductive reasoning to understand just why this place is so unique in Nashville. After all, beer-and-a-bar do not a public house make--not in the best British tradition, at any rate. While Sherlock's boasts fine British ales (Guinness, Bass, Whitbread and McEwan's, for starters) and an authentic Brit-pub menu (with Scottish egg, Cornish pasties and fish & chips, of course), it's the ambience that's incomparable. Since 1994, proprietors Margaret and Terry Widlake, natives of Derbyshire, have infused Sherlock's with Essence of Pubness. It's a convivial, homey, even slightly eccentric place to congregate and recharge over a pint of ale or a pot of tea.

<B> Best Martini:<I> John Bridges' Martini Class</I> </B> Taught by John Bridges, Nashville's martini impresario, this once-a-year class is under the umbrella of continuing-education courses sponsored by the University School of Nashville. The last one was conducted in our own kitchen. At the lectern, waving a toothpicked olive, Bridges divided the session up into roughly three parts: the history of the drink; lab time for making our own drinks; and real life taste-testing, which promptly brought an end to the class. The marvelous thing about Professor Bridges is that he speaks from a wealth of experience. He showed how to: put gin or vodka with ice in a glass container (it can even be a jar); add a touch of vermouth; stir (DO NOT SHAKE!); then pour the liquid into a chilled martini glass and add olives. The class started innocently enough, with students gathered around our kitchen island with pens and pencils. Half an hour later, everyone was high-fiving one another and hugging the dog. The more diligent students stuck around in the lab and made another. Practish maysh perfeck.

<BR><BR>Best Locally Brewed Beer:</B> <I> Boscos Famous Flaming Stone Beer</I> As Boscos' lightest beer, Flaming Stone has won numerous honors, including a three-star rating in <I>The Simon and Schuster Pocket Guide to Beer</I>. The beer is brewed using a traditional German technique, in which heated stones are lowered into the beer during the brewing process. This lends Flaming Stone its unique caramel character, which tends to melt the loftiest beer lover. And while you can handle a couple without feeling like you've eaten a double cheeseburger, it's a far cry in taste and body from the lifeless crud we Americans usually guzzle from a can. Careful, though--Flaming Stone goes down a little <I>too</I> easily, and before you know it your  "drink after work" has turned into a 1 a.m. adventure.

<B> Best Non-Alcoholic Drink: "<I> Sassy-Frass" Tea, Mr. Boo's </I></B>The sassafras tree is as common in Middle Tennessee fencerows as plastic six-pack rings, and yet few people associate the mitten-shaped leaf with the piquant, faintly medicinal taste that puts the zing in root beer. At the Donelson hot-chicken hangout Mr. Boo's, the Bouglea family has started brewing sweet tea every day with sassafras, and customers are downing the drink in 32-ounce cupfuls. Small wonder. The family's carefully protected Bouglea pepper, which grows wild on their Louisiana parish property and gives their chicken its smoky heat, is a sexy beast with a cumulative bite. The sassafras seems to douse the chicken's fire, and it aids digestion as well. Of course, if the brew stays this popular, the trees may start disappearing by the grove. We have the Lorax on speed-dial.

Ruffage lovers will appreciate the delicate care the kitchen takes with the restaurant's most basic offering. To prepare the house salads, it's as if each lettuce leaf--always a bright, springy green--is individually washed and dried, then artfully laid one atop the other beneath crisp red onion and always <I>red</I>--not anemic, mealy, pink--tomatoes. There's none better.

Foodies traveling to the San Francisco area know to make reservations weeks, if not months, in advance. Chef Deb Paquette, who owns Zola with husband Ernie, is one of the restaurant's legions of fans, and the French Laundry salad on her dinner menu is a nod to its namesake. A plate of pungent young arugula, peppery radicchio, sweet apples, fennel, crunchy hazelnuts, tangy bleu cheese and cured orange peel makes for a perfect balance of taste, texture and color, and is then air-kissed with a subtle champagne vinaigrette.

<B> Best Appetizer: <I> Fried Asparagus, Kote's</I> </B> When it comes to food, quantity is often mistaken for quality and an indecipherable list of ingredients for culinary sophistication. The fried-asparagus appetizer at Kote, on the other hand, is the embodiment of KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). A dozen crisp spears of fresh asparagus are rolled in toasted bread crumbs, flash-fried and arranged on a plate like the base of a Lincoln Log cabin, with a ramekin of creamy horseradish sauce for dipping. (Share only with close friends, as it is impossible not to double-dip.) Just $6.95, it is sized to stimulate, not sate, the appetite.

<B> Best Asian Appetizer: <I>Nam Sod, Royal Thai </I></B>Who would have ever thought that some of the best Thai food in Middle Tennessee could be found in a Franklin strip mall, next to a Hollywood Video? A history lesson on the menu tells the education-hungry diner that the purpose of Thai food is to combine successfully all the tastes (sweet, sour, bitter and salty) into one dish. The best attempt is seen in the menu's Item #303, the Nam Sod salad. With ground pork, cashews, onions, kaffir lime juice and ginger, the dish is prepared as spicy as the eater can take it--mild, medium, hot or native Thai. And take it from someone who's tried: don't try to impress your girlfriend by ordering Nam Sod  "native" style.

<B> Best Chips & Salsa: <I> La Hacienda</I> </B> Store-bought tortilla chips, flaky in texture and extremely salty, miss authentic tacqueria taste by a long shot. True Mexican tortilla chips--like those served at La Hacienda on Nolensville Road--are almost thin enough to see through, greasy enough to appear slightly moist, and taste almost bland. Similarly, Kroger-brand salsa, chunky and mild, is far thicker than anything you'll get south of the border, more appetizer than appetite whetter. The salsa at La Hacienda is almost watery in texture and doesn't spare the red chile. The effect of the combination is just as addictive, acclimating the taste buds to the spicy food to come without ruining one's meal.

<BR><BR>Best Fried Chicken: <I> (Tie) Prince's Hot Chicken Shack/Mr. Boo's </I></B>While Mike Tyson was trying to set up some sissyboy slap-party at the Gaylord Entertainment Center, a Sharks-vs.-Jets-style rumble was going down elsewhere in the city between warring factions of hot-chicken aficionados. Pepper-packed fried chicken is to Nashville what deep-dish pie is to Chicago: not just a hometown specialty, a culinary object of sports-team fanaticism. So when fans of upstart Mr. Boo's in Donelson had the audacity to suggest it was better than undisputed champ Prince's off Dickerson Road, the neckbones rained like Laaz rockets. Bravely we wade into the fray to say: Call a truce. We give the slightest of edges to Prince's deliriously hot bird, an esophageal widowmaker with a fiery-red crust, over Mr. Boo's and its secret weapon, the closely guarded Bouglea pepper. But the Bouglea family gains an advantage with their awesome side dishes--pickled sweet tomatoes, pickled apple rings, crinkle-cut fries with coarse-ground salt--and thick bread that absorbs grease with a lot more finesse than Prince's toothpicked Colonial slices. Look, if my chicken-loving buddy Jeff Harmon won't choose a clear-cut victor, neither should you. And now, if my work here is done, the Middle East awaits.

<B>Best Pizza by the Slice: <I>House of Pizza, Arcade</I></B> When you step up to Manny Macca's pizza counter in the downtown Arcade, don't go for the usual triangle of melted cheese and dough--which is as fine a slice of pie as you'll find in this town. Instead, try the thick, square Sicilian variety, which offers the ideal ratio of bread (more leavened than normal pizza dough) to cheese (not too much of it) to sauce (perfectly seasoned). If only Manny's sold Italian ices, it'd be the perfect Noo Yawk-style lunch during the summertime.

<B>Best Sandwich: <I>The Yellow Porch</I></B> A turkey Reuben is a marvelous treat if you want something more substantial than a banana and a bagel, but not the kind of heavy lunch that will have you nodding off by 3 p.m. The Yellow Porch seems to have perfected this underrated plate, providing the standard sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing but substituting sourdough bread for rye. I used to meet my girlfriend there for lunch once a week, looking forward both to her company and my turkey Reuben. The girl's gone, but fortunately they still serve the Reuben.

<B>Best Comfort Dish: <I>Lamb Cassoulet, Yellow Porch</I></B> After some kitchen-hopping around town, chef Kim Totzke has found the perfect home for her unbridled creativity, her passion for fresh ingredients and love of robust flavors. While just outside its front door traffic races back and forth on busy Thompson Lane, inside The Yellow Porch is an oasis of culinary delights with a decided Mediterranean bent. A new menu is featured nightly, but frequent diners insist on a couple of regularly recurring dishes, among them the wondrously comforting lamb cassoulet. Chunks of tender lamb nestle in a hearty stew of white beans, roasted potatoes and spinach, topped with fresh bread crumbs and crisped under the broiler.

<B> Best Italian Comfort Food: <I> Gnocchi, Sole Mio</I> </B> Sole Mio does all its Italian fare with flair, but the tender, toothsome gnocchi is divine. Potato pasta served in soft, chewy morsels, covered in a creamy gorgonzola sauce and delivered hot to the table, gnocchi is the ultimate comfort food. Especially given Sole Mio's oft-mentioned view of the downtown skyline, which only adds to the overall enjoyment. If the potato dumplings leave room, try a sinful dessert such as a creamy, cheese-stuffed cannoli--it'll give you that much more reason to go to the Y the next morning.

At Church Street's recently remodeled A Taste of India, though, it's hard to order anything else once you've sampled the chunks of tandoori-roasted chicken in a buttery, fluorescent sauce fragrant with garam masala, cardamom and tomato. The perfect accompaniment: a basket of steaming <I>naan</I>, onion chutney and a creamy mango lasse.

<B> Best Cheap Meal: <I> Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Sliced Pork With Vermicelli), Kien Giang </I></B>There are numerous reasons to visit Kien Giang off Charlotte Avenue. The problem is, I've only been able to focus on one since my first visit, when I encountered this stout noodle dish. Served in a large bowl, this meal is layered with fresh lettuce and basil leaves at the bottom, a healthy portion of vermicelli noodles in the middle, and topped with charbroiled slices of pork. The secret, however, is the heavenly mixture of <I>nuoc mam</I> (fish sauce), garlic and sugar that is poured over the dish and mixed throughout. I often had a version of this dish while living in Hanoi, and I can honestly say that Kien Giang's is better. Complement the order with a <I>chanh</I>--a cold lemonade perfectly suited for summer--and the subtotal for one of the most satisfying meals in town is about $6.50.

A CIA alum, Weekley trained at New York's only four-star seafood restaurant, Le Bernadin, and about a decade ago brought his considerable skills here, working around town before opening Atlantis in early 2000. Thanks to the Happy Hour Bar Menu offered five nights weekly, frugal gourmands are not left wanting on the shores of these rich culinary waters. From 4-8 p.m. Tues.-Sat., at the bar or in the lounge, the special bar menu is half-priced. Thus, a $9 plate of fried baby calamari with spicy barbecue sauce is $4.50; the $10 Thai spring roll with raw tuna is $5; the chef's selection of raw oysters with radish slaw is slashed from $11 to $5.50. Drinks, domestic beer and house wines are also 50 percent off.

Once inside, though, you'll see the reason for the crush. Troy Smith's Thompson Lane goldmine offers inexpensive chicken, steak and juicy Mexican-barbecue burritos, made to order with condiments ranging from fresh chopped cilantro to saut&#233;ed mushrooms. Of course, you can skip the meats and load up on rice and veggies. And the fish taco, unknown even to many regulars, is a hidden treasure, a delicious fusion of golden battered fish and tangy white sauce in a steaming corn tortilla. Add chips, a tall fruit tea and tubs of zesty tomatillo sauce from the salsa bar, and you are on your way to taco heaven, for which the wait for parking is a small price to pay.

<B> Best Side Dish: <I> Fried Green Tomatoes, Arnold's Country Kitchen</I> </B> What do you do when faced with an unripe fruit or vegetable? In the South, you follow the two courses of action adaptable to anything that walks, swims, flies or grows in the ground: pickle it or fry it. Arnold's opts for the latter. The Eighth Avenue meat-and-three does this offbeat Southern specialty better than anyone, with a peppery cornmeal crust that punches up the pleasingly bittersweet tang of the tomatoes. Come to think of it, there's not much Arnold's doesn't ace, whether it's turnip greens, squash casserole, or our favorite, fried chicken livers over yellow rice. While out-of-towners and lazy travel writers fawn over Nashville's sorriest down-home cooking--you know who you are--smart eaters stay loyal to Mr. Arnold. And not just because he whistles while he works.

Griffith came to Nashville from San Francisco, a hotbed of Asian cuisine, where he apprenticed under a Vietnamese chef. At mAmbu, even more than his previous stints at Cakewalk and Sasso, he liberally sows culinary seeds from Vietnam, China, Japan and Thailand throughout his menu. His plump <I>gyoza</I> shrimp dumplings in broth are his calling card, but don't bypass the lobster-tail satay, the crispy quail on green papaya salad, the wasabi-crusted tuna or the caramelized shrimp bowl, his crustacean interpretation of <I>pho</I>.

Nowhere is this roll better prepared than at sushi master Luke Choi's small Belle Meade establishment Asahi. Most spiciness found in a sushi establishment comes from wasabi, which offers a pungent, nose-burning horseradish effect. Choi's spicy yellowtail forgoes the wasabi and derives its spiciness from a special chili sauce. So good it'll keep you coming back to Belle Meade for sushi, it's also so fiery it'll keep you reaching for your glass of water.

Brunch says that you are basically just picking up where you left off last night--and is there a city more attuned to picking up where you left off the night before than New Orleans? Extreme hedonists might hop on a Southwest flight for Bloody's in the Big Easy, but the rest of us working stiffs can get a midday Cajun wake-up call at Easy's in the Village, serving the only New Orleans-style weekend brunch in town.

Frozen bars of pureed cantaloupe, hibiscus, and tropical fruits such as mango and coconut--"whatever we can find at the market," Irma says--lie in colorful stacks in Las Paletas' glass case, alongside creamy variants like peanut butter and pistachio (my wife's favorite). Best of all are the ones that sound inedible, including a cucumber-chili pepper showstopper whose taste automatically cuts the temperature outdoors by 30 degrees. Patrons buy the $2 popsicles by the paper-bagful, sometimes for wedding receptions, sometimes as the secret ingredient in a float. We strongly recommend the pineapple-green-chili-lime, a sensual mixture of cool and fire that is downright sinful.

The frozen yellow bits offer textural variety and a little burst of buttery corn flavor. Diners who are at first put off by the unexpected presence of the staple grain soon find themselves seduced by the  "maize haze."

Even with the advent of civil rights and desegregation, white Nashvillians were slow to cross the great divide. The Swetts' son David remembers that one of their earliest white customers was Fate Thomas Jr., the teenage son of then-Sheriff Fate Thomas. Fate used to leave Father Ryan High School, load up his car and drive across town for soul food. Swett remembers that customers would ask who that white boy was, and he would answer,  "That's not a white boy, that's Little Fate."<\d> While Nashville's ubiquitous meat 'n' three restaurants have long provided a common gathering spot for socioeconomic diversity, Swett's arguably has done more than any other to break down Nashville's racial barriers, and shatters them still.
