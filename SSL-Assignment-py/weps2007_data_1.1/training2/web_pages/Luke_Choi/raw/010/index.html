	<p><a name="A"><p></a><b>AS-4: Computer Aided Durability Analysis with CAT/FALANCS</b><br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> LMS FALANCS implements fatigue life prediction for metals based on either the stress-life or the strain-life approach in a finite element environment. Its particular strength is a high speed implementation, which using special mathematical algorithms allows to find critical locations automatically even in large structures of                         250,000 elements and more. With CAT/FALANCS, this application is now available for CATIA users.<br>
	<b>Speaker: </b>Michael Hack, LMS International 
	</p>
	
	<p><b>AS-10: Application of CAT/ADAMS to Automotive Body Hardware Simulation</b><br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Attendees will learn how to prepare a CATIA Assembly for Dynamic Motion simulation, including modeling sophisticated phenomena such as contact, perform the dynamic motion simulation, and use the results to drive refinements in the design. The examples will represent typical problems encountered in the design of automotive body hardware.<br>
	<b>Speaker:</b> AJ Hoyt, Dassault Systemes</p>
	
	<p><b>AS-13: How to Predict Dynamic Loads in a Mechanical System Using CAT/DADS</b><br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Design modifications typically impact the way dynamic loads occur in mechanical systems. In this session, users will learn how to take a CATIA Kinematics model and perform a parametric study using CAT/DADS to predict dynamic loads due to various design changes.<br>
	<b>Speaker:</b> Chris Paulson, CADSI</p>
	
	<p><b>AS-16: Vibro-Acoustic Performance Modeling from the CATIA Model</b><br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> The training session focuses on the prediction of vibro-acoustic performance of system components. This process includes the creation of a dedicated acoustic mesh and boundary conditions, and recovers the noise radiation boundary conditions (or the acoustic loading) from the structural analysis model. In a post-processing phase, sound pressure levels at pre-defined visualization surfaces can be evaluated, along with the total
	radiated acoustic power - this post-processing phase thus establishes the validation of the component's functional performance as compared to imposed product specifications. The training session guides the CAT/SYSNOISE user through the entire process of model definition and results post-processing by means of a practical example.<br>
	<b>Speaker:</b> Luc Cremers, LMS International</p>
	
	<p><a name="H"><p></a><b>H/S-9: IBM Windows NT Administration</b><br>

	<p><b>TR-2: Leveraging the V5 CATIA Instructor</b><br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Even with the new CBT programs for learning CATIA, the on hand instructor still remains one of the leading resources for learning CATIA. But even the best instructors are limited on the number of students that they can influence. Self study training and reference guides can leverage CATIA knowledge, but the front end
	instruction (demo) and the on-the-job training has been missing. In this session we will demonstrate our new V5 On Demand computer based lecture series. Utilizing this three step approach (demo,work through, reference)frees up instructors for on-the-job training.<br>
