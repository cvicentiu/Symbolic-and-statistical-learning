<p class="MsoNormal">Contrary to popular prediction, the student newsletter <i>
The Bearded Dean</i> has survived a full year as of October 10<sup>th</sup>, 
2002.&nbsp; Enjoyed by students, faculty, and residents alike at the University 
Health Center, the web-based tract has featured nine editions since its debut in 
the fall of last year.&nbsp; But despite this auspicious landmark event, most prefer 
to celebrate another landmark occasion—the day immediately after the one year 
anniversary.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“It’s pretty neat if you think about it,” explained M3 Luke 
Choi.&nbsp; “One year ago today was the day after The Bearded Dean was first 
published.&nbsp; Before that day, there had never been any other day after the first 
day of The Bearded Dean. It blows your mind to think about it that way.&nbsp; Every 
once in a while, I’ll be interviewing a patient on the wards or holding a 
retractor in surgery, and my mind will start to wander.&nbsp; I remember how things 
used to be.&nbsp; That is, how they used to be before the <i>The Bearded Dean</i> was 
around.&nbsp; I mean, I guess that the same everyday things happened then as they do 
now in my life, but there wasn’t some unknown someone out there pointing out the 
funny moments.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“I used to never laugh,” remembers M4 Pritish Tosh.&nbsp; “I 
mean, I’d crack a joke or two every once in a while, but I’d always have this 
empty feeling that left me asking myself, ‘What is funny, really?’&nbsp; That’s what 
the <i>The Bearded Dean</i> showed me. How to laugh.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <i>The Bearded Dean</i> first came out,” Dr. Hosokawa 
said, “we were more than a bit nervous in the OME.&nbsp; We thought this might be the 
start of a student revolt.&nbsp; Or worse yet, what if the students figured out that 
all we really do is make copies and phone calls all day?&nbsp; But in hindsight, now 
that we’re at the one year and one day anniversary, I kind of chuckle every once 
in a while as I remember some of my favorite stories of the past year.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not everyone looks fondly upon the neophyte newsletter, 
however.&nbsp; One student, M3 Tom Watson, had this to say:&nbsp; “The Bearded Dan (sic)?&nbsp; 
That thing’s still around?&nbsp; Jesus.&nbsp; Can’t everyone see it’s just a couple of 
moron slackers that get together every month and put their lame-ass jokes into 
some poorly written articles? My infant child… what’s his name… or her, 
whatever, could make a better looking website. And on top of all that, do we 
really need or care about their mass e-mail announcements? You think if I took a 
shit on an empty pizza box and emailed everyone to come look at it I’d get any 
takers?&nbsp; Hell no.”&nbsp; </p>
