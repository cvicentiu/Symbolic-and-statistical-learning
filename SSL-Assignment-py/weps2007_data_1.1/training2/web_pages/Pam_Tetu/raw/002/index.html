<H2>Binational Conference on Environmental Research and Policy
to be Held at UC San Diego</H2>

<P>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO &#151; A binational conference
and workshop on U.S.-Mexico related environmental problems will
be held on June 12-13, 2000 at the Institute of the Americas Complex
at <A HREF="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</A>. Organized
by Keith Pezzoli of the UCSD Urban Studies and Planning department,
Palmer Taylor of the UCSD Department of Pharmacology, and Robert
Tukey of the UCSD Departments of Chemistry-Biochemistry and Pharmacology
(Taylor is also Director of the UCSD Superfund Program), the event
will bring together an invited group of U.S. and Mexican academics,
scientists, industry representatives, and community and national
leaders to examine binational issues with an emphasis on the California/Baja
California border region.</P>

<P>Organizers hope to show how a broad coalition of academicians,
scientists, community-based organizations and policy-makers in
federal and local agencies, and industry with binational and border
interests, can be organized to pursue common problems. The principal
objective of the conference and workshops is to provide the leadership
of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),
a cosponsor of the event, with a set of research and funding priorities
geared to informing the agenda of a prospective university-based
Binational Center. Another major objective, in which SDSC will
play a principal role, is to chart broadly applicable methods
and models for enabling an innovative integration of information
technology and communications issues with environmental science
and policy issues in a binational context.</P>

<P>Although the cost of the event is being covered by the cosponsors,
registration is required to ensure space. To register or for more
information, including directions, hotel accommodations, the agenda,
and a list of participants, see the conference Web site at <A
HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/niehsconference">http://www.sdsc.edu/niehsconference</A>.
To answer any other questions, contact Pam Tetu, 858-534-4028
or <A HREF="mailto:ptetu@ucsd.edu">ptetu@ucsd.edu</A>.</P>

<P>The conference will open with a morning plenary session and
a keynote luncheon with speakers involved in the development of
environmental policy at the local, state, and national levels.
The remainder of the day-and-a-half event will be organized around
a series of participatory breakout workshops in which, among other
things, participants will be encouraged to focus on how to integrate
information technology and communications issues with domain science
and policy issues. To help in this effort, research scientists
from the San Diego Supercomputer Center will provide an overview
of cutting-edge enabling technologies available for data collection,
integration, and sharing, as well as for enhanced modeling and
prediction. Day two of the conference will allow a more in-depth
and forward-looking discussion based on the collective results
of the breakout sessions.</P>

<P>Breakout workshops will focus on:</P>

<P>1. Hazardous waste management (binational priorities and challenges
for data collection, integration, and sharing).</P>

<P>2. Industrial ecology and environmental management systems
(environmental engineering, regional planning and pollution prevention).</P>

<P>3. Biomedical research (linking exposure with insult at the
genomic level); bioremediation.</P>

<P>4. Water quality in regional bays, estuaries, and coastal zones
(pesticides, heavy metals, and ecotoxicology).</P>

<P>5. Prevention/intervention research with a public health approach
geared to the U.S.-Mexico cross-border and transnational issues
(emphasizing occupational health, exposure assessment, infectious
disease vectors and environmental epidemiology).</P>

<P>6. Air pollution and global climate change (integrated risk
assessment).</P>

<P>7. Enabling multidisciplinary approach to environmental research,
education and training in the U.S.-Mexico transborder context
(the culture of binational networking and communication).</P>

<P>Generous support from the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences (NIEHS), the UC Toxic Substances Research &amp;
Teaching Program, and other organizations is making this event
possible.</P>

<P>Along with the San Diego Supercomputer Center, cosponsors include
NIEHS; UCSD Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program; <I>Direcci&oacute;n
de Planeaci&oacute;n de Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologi&iacute;a,
Municipio de Tijuana</I>; and UC San Diego, including Health-Sciences&#151;School
of Medicine, Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, Urban Studies and
Planning, Center for Environmental Research and Training, and
the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy (SCERP).
