<font size=-1>"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" (#37)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"The Raven" (#80)</font><br>
<table><tr>
	<td>Based on the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, <i>Tales</i> unifies itself through the music as much as it does through the poetry.  The instrumental theme of "A Dream within a Dream" recurs throughout the album in varied contexts, in the hit "Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" and in the instrumental "Pavane."  (This theme can also be heard at the end of the <i>I Robot</i> album.)  The 1987 version adds new guitar solos and the piquant narration of Orson Wells.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) "Prelude" to "The Fall of the House of Usher"; (2) the theatrical trio in "To One in Paradise," sung by Terry Sylvester (of the Hollies), Eric Woolfson, and Alan Parsons.</td>

<font size=-1>"Don't Let It Show" (#92)</font><br>
<table><tr>
	<td><a href="irobot.jpg"><img src="irobot.jpg" width=144 height=144></a></td>
	<td>Based on literary work by Isaac Asimov, <i>I Robot</i> uses a seamless collection of songs to portray its futuristic theme.  The four instrumentals--the most of any Project album--are the glue that holds the songs together.  In "Total Eclipse," Andrew Powell earns solo composition credit, showing his stylistic indebtedness to texture-music composer György Ligeti, with whom Powell studied.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the meditative organ sound and the theme of self-resignation in "Don't Let It Show," which remained the Project's most touching ballad until "Old and Wise."</td>
</tr></table>

<a name="Pyramid"><li><u><b>Pyramid</b></u> (1978) (#26) ****½</a><br>
<font size=-1>"What Goes Up..." (#87)</font><br>
The Project produced their third classic in a row with <i>Pyramid</i>, an exegesis on wonders of the world, both modern and ancient.  This theme works hand in hand with a four-note musical theme--which opens "Voyager" and recurs throughout the album, most conspicuously in "In the Lap of the Gods"--to unify the music.  In the closer, "Shadow of a Lonely Man," John Miles (voice of "Doctor Tarr") sings of fleeting notoriety.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) the beautiful string transition between "What Goes Up..." and "The Eagle will rise again; (2) the frenetic "Pyramania."<br>

<a name="Eve"><li><u><b>Eve</b></u> (1979) (#13) ***</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Da[sh]ed If I Do" (#27) [Thanks to Ian Bairnson for coining the euphemism.]</font><br>
"You can't live with them.  You can't live without them."  <i>Eve</i> does not recount the biblical history of the first woman, but uses her to symbolize every woman.  The tracks "You Won't Be There" and "If I Could Change Your Mind" (sung by Lesley Duncan) contain the best music on the album, and explore the man's and the woman's perspectives, respectively, of a failed relationship.  The rest of the songs seem experimental only for experiment's sake, and overtly pop-ish.  Those familiar with Clare Torry's work on Pink Floyd's <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> will be disappointed in her lead vocal credit on this album ("Don't Look Back").  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the introduction to "Lucifer."<br>

<a name="FriendlyCard"><li><u><b>The Turn of a Friendly Card</b></u> (1980) (#13) ****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Games People Play" (#16)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"Time" (#15)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"Snake Eyes" (#67; #47, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
<i>The Turn of a Friendly Card</i> was a watershed album that brought the group their first two top 20 hits.  Classic Project thematicism remains intact.  What's new here is Eric Woolfson's role as lead vocalist, introduced on "Time."  (Woolfson would sing the remainder of the Project's top 40 hits.)  The Turn of a Friendly Card Suite applies the cyclicism Parsons must have learned from his apprenticeship for the Beatles on their <i>Abbey Road</i> album.  To further unify the album, the brass theme that introduces "May Be a Price to Pay" returns--in the lips of a whistler--at the beginning of "The Gold Bug."  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the mesmerizingly beautiful "Time."<br>

<a name="Eye"><li><u><b>Eye in the Sky</b></u> (1982) (#7) ****½</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Eye in the Sky" (#3)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"Psychobabble" (#57; #54, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned" (#57, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>

<i>Eye</i> remains the Project's biggest commercial success, and one of their best musical successes.  It contains three indisputable classics:  the hit "Eye in the Sky," the epic "Silence and I," and the nostalgic "Old and Wise" (featuring Colin Blunstone's ethereal voice).  With "Sirius," the Project continued its tradition of introducing albums instrumentally.  Fan favorite "Psychobabble" contains a wonderfully bizarre bridge section.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) the segue from "Sirius" to "Eye in the Sky"; (2) the orchestral interlude in "Silence and I"; (3) Mel Collins's endless sax solo at the <i>repeat and fade</i> of "Old and Wise."</td><br>

<a name="BestOf"><li><u><b>The Best of the Alan Parsons Project</b></u> (1983) [compilation] (#53) ****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"You Don't Believe" (#54; #12, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
This record compiles the most popular cuts from each of the previous five albums, adding the new single "You Don't Believe" (which resurfaced on the Project's next album).  The "Best of" format forbids any theme to emerge, but the track list chronicles the Project's early essentials for the casual listener.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  that depends on what you're favorite early Project hit is!<br>

<a name="NH3Ave"><li><u><b>Ammonia Avenue</b></u> (1984) (#15) ****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Don't Answer Me" (#15)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"Prime Time" (#34)</font><br>
<table><tr>
	<td>Certifying gold, <i>Ammonia Avenue</i> still stands as Parsons's last big commercial success.  The album moved the Project one step further away from the orchestral rock of their early albums, concentrating instead on pop elements that made <i>Eye in the Sky</i> successful.  "Prime Time," at least in sound, is a near clone of "Eye in the Sky."  "Since the Last Goodbye" introduced a simpler approach to Project ballads.  And the catchy "Don't Anwer Me" became the Project's final top 20 hit.  Still, the title track remains true to the Project's orchestral roots.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the instrumental interlude to "Ammonia Avenue," which vies for the Project's greatest moment ever.</td>
	<td><a href="ammoniaa.jpg"><img src="ammoniaa.jpg" width=144 height=144></a></td>
</tr></table>

<a name="VultureCulture"><li><u><b>Vulture Culture</b></u> (1984) (#46) ****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)" (#71; #30, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
<font size=-1>"Let's Talk about Me" (#56; #10, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
<table><tr>
	<td><a href="vulturec.jpg"><img src="vulturec.jpg" width=144 height=144></a></td>
	<td>In 1984, the Project's orchestral arranger, Andrew Powell, temporarily left the band to devote time to the <i>Ladyhawke</i> film project.  Powell's presence is missed on <i>Vulture Culture</i>.  Nevertheless, the band perfected their pop/rock sound and produced a quality surprisingly consistent from song to song, to compensate for Powell's absence.  "Hawkeye" is one of the Project's best instrumentals to date.  "Somebody Out There" reexplores the paranoia theme of <i>I Robot</i>'s "Some Other Time."  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) the song "Vulture Culture," particularly the bass ostinato and the sax choruses; (2) Ian Bairnson's guitar solo at the end of "The Same Old Sun."</td>
</tr></table>

<a name="Stereotomy"><li><u><b>Stereotomy</b></u> (1985) (#43) *****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Stereotomy" (#82; #5, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
<i>Stereotomy</i> is completely devoid of dull moments!  John Miles returns to the group, singing the title track and "In the Real World."  "Limelight," perfectly performed, is an instant classic.  The instrumentals are outstanding, from the rhythmically skewed "Urbania" to the Grammy-nominated "Where's the Walrus?"  The latter's driving momentum sets up the contrasting "Light of the World," a tune that hits close to home for the religiously introspective.  "Stereotomy Two" closes the album how it began, giving a sense of thematic unification greater than in even the most programmatic of Alan Parsons Projects.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) Ian Bairnson's guitar and bass work on "Limelight" (though not the primary bass player on this track, Bairnson is responsible for the bass glissandos at the end); (2) the general pause at the climax of "Where's the Walrus?"<br>

<a name="Gaudi"><li><u><b>Gaudi</b></u> (1987) (#57) ****</a><br>
<font size=-1>"Standing on Higher Ground" (#3, Mainstream Rock)</font><br>
A return to extramusical thematicism, <i>Gaudi</i>, in style, foreshadows Woolfson's <i>Freudiana</i>.  The Woolfson-sung songs ("Closer to Heaven" and "Inside Looking Out") capture the reverence that architect Antonio Gaudi's works inspire.  The instrumental "Paseo de gracia" reprises a theme from the opening track ("La Sagrada Familia"), adding an appropriate dash of Spanish spice.  The funky rocker "Money Talks" adds a welcome bit of profaneness--both musically and thematically--to the album's subdued nature.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the orchestral interludes in the epic "La Sagrada Familia."<br>

<a name="Vol2"><li><u><b>The Best of the Alan Parsons Project Vol. II</b></u> (1988) [compilation] ****</a><br>
The Project's oeuvre now complete, <i>Best of, Vol II</i> chronicles Project hits since <i>Vol. I</i>, and the older classics "I Robot," "What Goes Up..." and "The Turn of a Friendly Card, Part Two."  The track list is even better in than <i>Vol. I</i>'s, especially in the <i>Vol. II</i> versions that include "La Sagrada Familia."  Unfortunately, some of the tracks are edited for time.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the contrast of "Limelight," which follows an album side's worth of faster songs.<br>

<a name="Instrumental"><li><u><b>Instrumental Works</b></u> (1988) [compilation] **** [currently out of print]</a><br>
Since no overview of The Alan Parsons Project is complete without instrumentals, this collection complements the "Best of" series nicely for the novice listener.  Admittedly, though, some tracks sound funny in isolation, out of their original contexts (i.e., "Voyager" and "Paseo de gracia").  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  that depends on what you're favorite Project instrumental is!<br>

<a name="Definitive"><li><u><b>The Definitive Collection</b></u> (1997) [compilation] ****½</a><br>
<table><tr>
	<td>This remastered set was the first compilation to contain tracks from <i>Tales</i> to Parsons's first "solo" project, <i>Try Anything Once</i>.  The sound improves on previously available recordings, especially the older ones.  Further, this is the first CD to contain the full version of "Standing on Higher Ground."  The chronological tracking gives the listener a guided tour through Project history.  The track selection is a little suspect, however, since "Limelight" and some of the longer classics are excluded.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the <i>Pyramid</i> tracks, which gain the most from remastering.</td>

	<td>This modern adaptation of all things Freudian evolved from what was supposed to be the band's eleventh "project" to a Woolfson stage musical.  The album <i>Freudiana</i> falls somewhere in between.  While exhibiting many of the characters and characteristics of an Alan Parsons Project, for better or worse Woolfson's theatrical leanings take over.  This makes for some great pop/rock tunes--featuring guest vocalists <a href="http://www.leosayer.com/">Leo Sayer</a> and Kiki Dee as well as Project regulars--and some more stagey numbers.  Surprisingly, the three instrumentals lack the excitement of the Project's previous ones.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b> (1) the attractive comical number "Little Hans," often compared to the Beatles' "Penny Lane"; (2) the saxophone interludes of "Let Yourself Go."</td>

<a name="TryAnythingOnce"><li><u><b>Try Anything Once</b></u> (1993) (#122) *****</a><br>
<table><tr>
	<td><i>Try Anything Once</i> is at the same time a study in consistency and variety.  With no programmatic theme to  rule the concept of the album, it is the music, instead, that rules.  Parsons juxtaposes cohesiveness and disparateness most obviously in "Jigue" and "Re-jigue," which apply the same melody to two different genres of music.  <a href="http://www.ambrosiaweb.com/ambrosia/">Ambrosia</a> member <a href="http://www.davidpack.com/">David Pack</a> is a most welcome addition to the band.  With the absense of Eric Woolfson, <a href="http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/">Eric Stewart</a> becomes the most frequent lead vocalist.  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) "Mr. Time," introducing Jacqui Copeland as lead vocalist; (2) "Siren Song" (sung by Stewart), reminiscent of "To One in Paradise"; (3) "Oh Life" featuring Pack's vocals and Parsons's flute playing.</td>

<a name="Live"><li><u><b>(The Very Best) Live</b></u> (1995) [live compilation] **½</a><br>
Recorded on the band's tour to promote <i>Try Anything Once</i>, this collection, disappointingly, contains no <i>Try Anything Once</i> tracks.  Instead, Gary Howard and Chris Thompson sing covers of Project classics, originally sung by Eric Woolfson, Lenny Zakatek, and others.  The new recruits lack not only the distinctive voices of their Project counterparts, but also the ability to sing in tune.  (Particularly egregious, in this regard, is the live version of "Time").  Still, the concert has its moments, the best of which is the performance of "The Raven."  The three new studio tracks, included on the American pressings, make the CD worth a listen.  Drummer Stuart Elliott earned his first lead vocal credit on the new "Take the Money and Run" (which Elliott also co-wrote).  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  "You're the Voice," the new Chris Thompson classic.<br>

<a name="OnAir"><li><u><b>On Air</b></u> (1996) ***½</a><br>
A combination CD and CD-ROM set, <i>On Air</i> represents a unique approach to unifying a concept non-musically.  To fully appreciate this project, one must spend some time browsing the CD-ROM, which recounts the history of aviation.  Only then does the music seem like more than a collection of songs about the same subject; the sequence of the set seems more purposeful.  Grammy-winner <a href="http://www.christophercross.com/">Christopher Cross</a> sings "So Far Away."  <b><i>Greatest moments:</i></b>  (1) the elegiac ballad "Brother up in Heaven"; (2) the introduction of full orchestra in "Blue Blue Sky II."<br>

<a name="TimeMachine"><li><u><b>The Time Machine</b></u> (1999) ****½</a><br>
<table><tr>
	<td><a href="timemach.jpg"><img src="timemach.jpg" width=144 height=144></a></td>
	<td>With <i>The Time Machine</i>, Parsons concentrated on his role as producer and engineer, allowing the talents of "musical associates" Ian Bairnson and Stuart Elliott to shine.  The music hints at a variety of styles, including blues and folk.  Parsons's production is at its most ethereal since <i>Eye in the Sky</i>, effectively reflecting the mysticism of time travel.  Lyrics invoke the dead (in the song <a href="http://www.herlin.org/ratings/callup.htm">"Call Up"</a>) as well as classic Project songs.  The disc features Bairnson's recorded debut as saxophonist, and guest vocalists <a href="http://www.tony-hadley.com/noflash/tony/tony.html">Tony Hadley</a> (of Spandau Ballet), Maire Brennan (of <a href="http://www.jtwinc.com/clannad/">Clannad</a>), and <a href="http://www.beverleycraven.com/">Beverley Craven</a>.  The Japanese version includes the bonus instrumental "Beginnings," featuring Parsons as narrator.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the return of Colin Blunstone's vocals on "Ignorance Is Bliss."</td>
</tr></table>

<a name="ValidPath"><li><u><b>A Valid Path</b></u> (2004) ****</a><br>
<table><tr>
	<td>Recorded without longtime bandmates Ian Bairnson and Stuart Elliott, <i>A Valid Path</i> is really Parsons's first solo album.  <i>A la</i> <a href="http://www.santana.com/">Santana</a>, nearly every track is a collaboration, and Parsons's guest list is a veritable "who's who" of electronica (<a href="http://www.shpongle.com/frame-main.htm">Shpongle</a>, <a href="http://thecrystalmethod.com/">The Crystal Method</a>, <a href="http://www.milrecords.com/eng/main.htm">Nortec Collective</a>, Uberzone), and rock (Pink Floyd's David Gilmour).  That said, Parsons remains the driving creative force behind every track, even assuming lead vocal and guitar duties for "We Play the Game."  "More Lost without You" and "You Can Run"--featuring <a href="http://www.pjolsson.com/">P. J. Olsson</a> and David Pack, respectively--combine elements of rock/pop with electronica to great effect.  But perhaps greater weight is given to instrumentals, the most noteworthy of which is "Tijuanic," an interesting mix of electronica and mariachi (something Nortec Collective is known for), with some microtonal <i>glissandi</i> thrown in for color.  Two classic Project tracks are revisited with the aid of Jeremy Parsons (Alan's son), who here proves himself a formidable programmer.  "Mammagamma 04" works better stylistically here than it did in its classic presentation on <i>Eye in the Sky</i>; "A Recurring Dream within a Dream," however, serves primarily to evoke the <i>Tales</i> opener, a distracting detour from the more "valid path" of new compositions.  The album ends with a <a href="http://www.thejohncleese.com/">John Cleese</a> cameo that will delight <a href="http://www.pythonline.com/">Monty Python</a> fans, and a fun reference to the <a href="http://www.thebeachboys.com">Beach Boys</a>' "Pet Sounds."  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  Parsons's lead vocal on the Crystal Method collaboration "We Play the Game."</td>

Many of the tracks included here do not lend themselves well to orchestral treatment.  While the orchestrations themselves are refreshingly imaginative, the ubiquitous trap set gets in their way.  As a result, Powell's contributions on the original songs surpass these orchestral versions.  "What Goes Up," which replaces the trap set in spots with orchestral tympani, works extremely well.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  the bassoon duet after the introduction in "Games People Play."<br>

<a name="Ladyhawke"><li><u><b>Original Motion Picture Soundtrack:  Ladyhawke</b></u> (1985/1995) **½</a><br>
Much of the <i>Ladyhawke</i> soundtrack works better on screen than on disc.  The catchy main theme is an effective <i>Leitmotif</i> in the movie, but it does not provide enough diversity within the music.  The 1995 re-release contains some gems that didn't fit on the original vinyl.  The newly available film version of "Chase/Fall/Transformation" represents some of a fine composer's writing at its finest.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  "Turret Chase/Fall/Wolf Trapped in Ice/Transformation" (tracks 16, 17, and 18 on the CD re-release).<br>

Peter Bardens of <a href="http://www.camelproductions.com/">Camel</a> joined Project regulars Colin Blunstone, Ian Bairnson, David Paton, and Stuart Elliott to form the one-project band <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/3254/keats.html">Keats</a>.  The album <i>Keats</i> is one of the best Project-related projects and one of the best kept Project-related secrets.  Blunstone's voice soars from beginning to end.  "Heaven Knows" and "Tragedy" provide a strong start.  "How Can You Walk Away" resembles <i>Ammonia Avenue</i>'s "Dancing on a Highwire."  In general, the group sounds like a subdued version of <a href="http://www.potsw.org/">Kansas</a>, and is more song-oriented than Project art-rock.  The 1996 re-release adds the Bairnson tune "Hollywood Heart," originally omitted from American vinyl versions of the album, and new and interesting interviews with Parsons and Bairnson.  <b><i>Greatest moment:</i></b>  "Walking on Ice."<br>
