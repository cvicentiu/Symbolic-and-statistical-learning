was spent with her family. assisting in the home work.&nbsp; When eight
years of age her mother died, and from that time until her father re-married

parents, and down through the years heLd them in the very highest esteem.
They were always fair and just in any decision they made.&nbsp; There was
a very happy atmosphere in their home.
<p>One of the greatest ambitions of both parents was that all of their
chfldren should receive an edncation and to that end, through the efforts
of Cornelius, their last farm near Mt. Blanchard, Ohio, was annexed to
the Mt. Blanchard Village School District; and their home on Lirna Road
also was annexed, to the Findlay School District.

educational ambitions for their children realized.
