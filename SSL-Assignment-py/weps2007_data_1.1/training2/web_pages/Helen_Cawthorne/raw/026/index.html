<h3><center>BILL NEWMAN enjoys an evening's entertainment<br>by Piano 40 at London's Purcell Room,<br>Wednesday 5 February 2003</center></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>To coin a favourite ditty from the late 30s-early 40s: 'If you go down
to the PR tonight, you're in for a nice surprise'! Close friend and colleague
Nadia Lasserson, one of four pianists who make up Piano 40 -- the others
are Jeremy Brown, Helen Cawthorne and Richard Deering (who also compered)
-- told me some time back that their next event would be something of an
improvement on the last. Exactly so. With just one personnel change, the
ensemble's overall sound is tighter, more compact, with cleaner, more fluent
voicings and a newly discovered confidence in their already considerable
abilities to communicate both old <I>and</I> new repertoire to an ever-appreciative
audience.</P>

<P>For listeners, the beaming presence of the composer is an added incentive
to what they have just heard, but I continually wonder what opportunities
many have for repeat hearings when faced with the circumscribed opinions
of so-called experts who rule the television and radio broadcasting airwaves.
If you can write a good tune, you are immediately suspect, and if you model
-- however discretely -- your style on any past composer or a trend of musical
development from another century, you are deemed 'out of fashion'.</P>

<P>Thankfully, more worthwhile composers with their consistent attempts
to avoid 'musical' comparisons with 'life as it is, <I>now </I>' tempered
by 'wholesale annihilation in the near future', are slowly making their
mark on the entertainment scene.</P>

<P>Judging by the response they received, both creators and interpreters
at Piano 40 events can feel proud of establishing a rapport and degree of
excellence that augers well for <I>all</I> future get-togethers. A CD will
also be forthcoming.</P>
