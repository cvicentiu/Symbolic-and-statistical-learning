EDITOR'S JOURNAL...

NEW YORK-LONDON-BOSTON-NEW YORK IN THREE AND A HALF DAYS

My wife Jane will tell you that I'm a glutton for punishment.  
No argument.  Who else would give up both a good-paying job, 
not to mention almost every Sunday of the year, to publish a 
running newsletter?

But the London/Boston double had more than the lure of self abuse.  
With Haile, Paula, Paul, Abdelkader, Khalid, Derartu, Susan, 
Joyce, Svetlana, Antonio and many others due to line up in London, 
I simply had to be there.  Sure, I'm out recruiting for the NYC 
Marathon, but I wanted to witness history.  In what other marathon 
would one of the protagonists tell the media he was going to go out 
in 62:30?  This, I had to see for myself.

On the back end, I never miss Boston.  It's not only a great race but a great place 
to do business.  Boston is where all sorts of deals are pondered, executed and signed.  
It's the de facto Spring Running Industry Conference.  You can't miss it.  
Besides, I finally got invited to the Hancock pre-race dinner with live entertainment 
by the Monkees.  That's right.  Davy Jones, Mickey Dolans and, well, an eight-piece 
back-up band.  That's so good that Jane even made the trip up from New York.

After a delicious catfish dinner with baby spinich at 4:00 p.m. on Friday, Jane 
walked me to the subway at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue.  A hug, a kiss and 
several "I love yous" and I was gone.  The train took me to Penn Station in the 
thick of rush hour.  It was madness.  The line to buy a ticket for the train to 
Newark International Airport was so long I resigned myself to paying the $3 penalty 
for buying my ticket on the train.  The train pulled out at 5:24, and 20 minutes 
later I was in the airport.

After watching a nasty argument between an airline passenger and a flight crew 
(a flight attendant had cursed at her on an arriving flight) I tried to board 
my 7:55 p.m. flight for Gatwick.  No such luck.  I was randomly chosen for a 
security check and had to be searched and wanded with a metal detector.  No worries, 
I was clean.

I could only take a small bag with a few items because when I would fly into 
Boston on Sunday I would have to move right from customs and head to Back Bay 
to make the Hancock dinner.  No time to wait in baggage claim!  I felt naked 
with just two shirts and some underwear and sox.  Jane would bring my running 
shoes to Boston for a Monday morning run.

The Continental flight to London's Gatwick Airport was the overnighter where 
you get dinner at your normal bedtime, pretend to sleep for a few hours, then 
are jolted awake for a quick breakfast in what your body thinks is the middle 
of the night.  Besides the usual lower leg and feet swelling, I made it to 
London in one piece.

After breezing through U.K. customs, I bought the £11 ticket for the Gatwick 
Express, and caught the 8:25 to Victoria Station.  Half an hour later I got 
some currency and used the Underground to get to the Tower Hill station and 
walked to the Thistle Tower Hotel.  Things were going so smoothly that I sensed 
that I just had to hit a pothole soon.

Instead, it was a crater.

Between checking in at the hotel and eating my lunch, my passport went missing.  
I searched my clothes, my bag, my room, all the places I had been in the hotel.  
Nothing.  The hotel staff helped me search, and got housekeeping to toss my room.  
Still nothing.  It was gone.

I went to the Overseas Athletes Lounge on the 12th floor, and used the Internet 
access there to find out what to do from the U.S. State Department, then I called 
Jane on my mobile.  She dug out the photocopy of my passport and faxed it to the 
hotel, then called the emergency number in Washington, DC.  When we spoke again, 
she gave me the local telephone number in London for the U.S. Consulate.  The 
understanding and efficient weekend duty officer told me to go to the police 
station to file a report, and then bring the passport photocopy and police report 
to the airport where airline personnel would call him again on the following day
 to grant me a waiver by phone.  He reassured me that things would work out and 
to go about my business.

After the sleepless night on the plane and the lost passport stress, I went back 
to my room and slept, deeply, waking in time to meet my New York Road Runners 
colleagues for dinner at an Italian restaurant.  A glass of chianti classico, 
a bowl of minestrone and a plate of pollo alla Fiorentina, and I was feeling
 pretty good.  Back at the hotel, I fell asleep instantly for the night.

Race day was action packed.  I checked out of the hotel by 7:00 a.m., and met
 NYRR media chief Richard Finn for breakfast.  After telling him the passport 
story, he said that he had been passed two counterfeit £5 notes at a pub.  
When he tried to spend one of them to buy a cold drink, a sharp sales clerk 
stopped him.  "This is counterfeit, sir," she said.  It turned out he had more 
than one, and finally used a third note to buy his drink.

After breakfast, Richard and I took the Underground to the press center near the 
finish line, and got good positions in the press room.  In a sign of just how big 
this race was, Jere Longman of the New York Times, Dick Patrick of USA Today, 
and Phil Hersh of the Chicago Tribune all managed to get their editors to send 
them for this overseas assignment.  Both Patrick and Hersh usually cover Boston 
(Frank Litsky covers Boston for the Times), but the lure of Haile's and Paula's 
debuts plus the stacked fields brought them over the pond this year.

The races were nothing short of spectacular (see story below), but I didn't have 
any time to linger on Khalid's world record or Paula's instant membership in the 
sub-2:20 club.  The top men finished right before noon, and I made a few cell 
phone calls to the States to make my reports and bolted.  I had a 2:30 flight 
at Heathrow for Boston and had to leave straight away.  I hailed a taxi after 
walking away from the secured finish area, and I was off.

As the driver sped along the M4 to the airport, I watched nervously as the meter 
ticked off the pounds I owed.  I knew I had £35 in my wallet plus perhaps £3 in 
coins.  That wasn't going to get it done.  The tab came to £41 (good thing I used
 the trains earlier) and I had to pay him the difference in USD. I offered Euro, 
but he didn't know the conversion; greenback's made him more comfortable.

Now for the real test.  Could I really board my Virgin Atlantic flight to Boston 
with just a ticket, a fax of a copy of my passport and a police report?  I was 
pulled off of the check-in line and had to see a supervisor named Zayed.  I took 
him through what the U.S. consulate officer had told me, and he started to take 
down my information.  He called the consulate emergency number, was transferred 
to the duty officer's mobile phone in his car, and the waiver was granted.  The 
officer asked to speak to me.  "What happened in the marathon," he asked?  "It 
was spectacular," I replied, and gave him all the news. He seemed genuinely 
interested, and wished me well on my trip.

The supervisor took me to the front of the check-in line, my boarding pass was 
issued, and I was on my way to the gate.  

But this was only part one of the test.  What would happen upon arrival in Boston 
at U.S. Customs?  The duty officer told me to expect a delay, but that, "they 
wouldn't make me go back on the plane and look for my passport again at the hotel."  
I wasn't feeling particularly reassured as I boarded.

Three cheers for the U.S. Customs Service.  The agent in Boston took me to a 
supervisor and within two minutes I was cleared to pass through.  With no baggage 
to claim, I was in a taxi five minutes later heading for Back Bay.  My mobile phone 
rang in the tunnel.  "Hi sweetie," said Jane with relief.  She was in the Hancock 
hospitality suite at the Copley Plaze Hotel waiting for me.  I got to the hotel by 
5:25, and the cocktail reception began five minutes later.  A quick wash-up and 
shave, and I was ready.

The Hancock reception and dinner is one of road racing's great traditions.  Some 
400 people are treated to a traditional New England lobster bake, including baked 
beans and corn of the cob.  They always provide name entertainment, often with a 
nostalgic flavor.  The Monkee's show was fun, capped off by Davey Jones dancing 
in the middle of the dining room with the audience.

We pushed away from our table at 8:26 p.m., and headed around the corner for the 
Runner' World reception at a local women's fitness facility.  I was pressed for 
London details by everybody I spoke to.  My body thought it was 2:00 a.m., but 
I was enjoying myself.

Because we only needed a hotel for one night in Boston, we had to stay out at the 
airport.  I used an Internet travel site to get a discount room and lucked out 
with a $78 rate at the brand new Logan Airport Hilton, a really great hotel.  Jane 
and I got to bed by 11:00 p.m., but were awakened at 3:30 a.m. when my mobile 
phone rang.  It was my hotel back in London reporting that my passport had still 
not been located.  The manager apologized for calling so early, assuming I was 
still in the U.K.  "It's 3:30 here," I told her, and she apologized again.

I chose to sleep in the next morning instead of running.  I admit it.  But I knew 
I had a long day covering the marathon and doing RRW.  The rest of the day went 
fine, and we took the 5:20 p.m. Amtrak Acela train back to New York, arriving before 9:00.  

I worked on RRW until 10:30, but was out of gas.  Sleep came easy, as I dreamt of 
breaking a world record.

   NOTE: Story by MARK BUTLER in London --Ed.

   LONDON (14-Apr) -- Has there ever been such a day of marathon running?  The 22nd 
Flora London Marathon saw the fastest ever run by a man and arguably the greatest ever 
by a woman.
   On a seasonably cool and and still day, British débutante Paula Radcliffe could hardly 
have done more to demonstrate that she knew all about how to run a marathon. She didn't 
just win the race, with 2:18:56 she destroyed the field, ruptured the previous women's
-only best, picked up $255,000 in prize and bonus money and came to the brink of Catherine Ndereba's absolute world mark from Chicago, 2001. All this on her first attempt at the distance. Such was the magnitude of Radcliffe's run in front of a home crowd that it 
was almost an anti-climax when Khalid Khannouchi clipped his own world best to 2:05:38,
some 20 minutes later.
   There were fears that Radcliffe, a natural front runner, might overcook the pace in 
this, her first marathon. She and race favourite Derartu Tulu had requested 70:30 at 
halfway from rabbits Iness Chenonge and Maria Guida.  Those two soon had a gap of about 70m from Radcliffe, Derartu Tulu, Reiko Tosa, Susan Chepkemei and Shitaye Gemechu. A third 
group, featuring Joyce Chepchumba and Svetlana Zakharova, followed a similar distance 
behind. The four-mile split (21:36) was exactly the same as when Chepchumba set the 
women's only course record of 2:23:22 in 1999. Just before that point, a relaxed Radcliffe could be seen offering a drink to Tulu, an offer which was refused with a grin.
Chepchumba's group closed up as the pace slipped to 5:38 in mile six.
Approaching Greenwich, the first of the wheelchair racers began to pass the leading 
women. Radcliffe chose this time to pick up her pace so that she began to catch Guida, 
who had dropped back a little from Chenonge. Soon, only Tulu and Chepkemei were in contact.
   All the Radcliffe accessories were in place, except the white high sox (she wore 
flesh-colored ones under ankle sox): the noseband, the red ribbon indicating her 
support of blood testing, and the same eight bib pins as she wore when winning the 
world cross country title. There was her trademark head-dip, but this time it did not 
signal any discomfort.  Instead, it seemed to emphasise her desire to further open 
up the pace. At 10 miles (Chenonge 54:26), Radcliffe was eight seconds ahead of Tulu 
and Chepkemei with the rest of the contenders out of sight.
  That gap grew steadily, while Radcliffe reeled in Chenonge. Coming across Tower 
Bridge, she caught the Kenyan and took a very rare (for her) look back before flashing 
though halfway in 71:05.  She was now 1:23 up on her nearest rival.
   With no sign of the opposition, strong crowd support and a downhill stretch ahead 
of her, Radcliffe moved up another gear and raced through the next three miles in 5:07, 
5:08 and 5:11. By 16 miles, the gap on second place Tosa, who had moved into second 
place, was growing with Radcliffe now one minute inside Chepchumba's 1999 pace.  There 
were murmers of concern that she might have done too much too soon. If anything, however, Radcliffe seemed to look ever better as her lead grew, and more seemed comfortable 
running by herself.
   On the Isle of Dogs where there are few spectators, Radcliffe's miles had dropped 
to 5:16 but her lead was two minutes at 19 miles and her projected time was getting signficantly faster. Any feeling that she might be outkicked or tie up was evaporating,
 and the press began to speculate about her winning time. At 21 miles (1:52:06) she 
was three minutes quicker than Chepchumba had been three years ago. She stepped up to a 5:08 mile and 2:19 came within range.
   Her 25th mile, along Victoria Embankment, was at 5:06, the fastest of the race. Her 
time at 25 miles was 2:12:42 compared with 2:12:21 by Ndereba in Chicago. Far back, Tosa 
held second from the Russian pair of Svetlana Zakharova and Lyudmila Petrova, the 2001 World Championships bronze medalist and 2000 New York City Marathon champion, respectively.
   In the last mile there were two tiny problems for Radcliffe, but these were shrugged 
off. First, one of the television motorcycles got a little to close for comfort, then 
a large Ethiopian flag flapped into her face. As she turned with the finish line in sight, the clock clicked 2:18:22 which meant that Ndereba's record was safe. No-one else's were 
and Radcliffe won in 2:18:56, a whopping seven minutes faster than the old British record 
which had stood to Véronique Marot since 1989. She ran the second half of the race in 
67:52, quicker than the current world leading mark for the half-marathon. Radcliffe 
looked remarkably composed after the finish as she was embraced by her husband Gary 
before waving to the crowd. The prize money will come nicely  in time for their 
wedding anniversary on the following day.
   "My legs are tired by the rest of me is really pleased," said the winner.  "I would 
have liked to have got the 2:18:47 but I gave it everything, I couldn't have gone any 
faster."
   Regarding her mid-race surge, "I thought 'I've blown it'," revealed
Radcliffe.  "I thought, well, I cannot blow it because I'm going to be
slagged off, they would say 'what's that idiot doing in a marathon race ... then I 
realised I had only had about 55 minutes to run, and I do that every day."
   Zakharova outkicked Petrova for second, with both comfortably inside the old Russian 
record. Tosa was an excellent fourth in 2:22:26 while Chepkemei also smashed her 
previous best, despite slowing to vomit in the last miles of the race. In sixth place, Chempchumba notched up her
13th successive sub-2:30. Tulu faded to ninth place.
   There was much pre-race talk about the requisite pace in the men's race to 
halfway. The Gebrselassie camp wanted 62:30, a mark which was regarded as "suicidal" 
by the other principals and their aides. In the event that point was reached in a 
fast 62:46 with a large leading group of 13, most of which --confusingly-- were 
dressed in a similar shade of blue.
   Of the designated pacemakers, it was Luis Jesús who seemed to be working the 
hardest and he continued to lead until 16 miles or so in the shadow of Britain's 
tallest building on Canary Wharf. The pace was fast and constant, with six successive 
miles timed between 4:49 and 4:39. After Jesús dropped out it was Gebrselassie who 
took over. He did not speed things up  like Radcliffe, but the group began to shrink 
and by 17 miles it was down to seven - Geb, Khannouchi, Pinto, El Mouaziz, Tergat, 
Jifar and one surprise: South Africa's Ian Syster [NOTE: Pronounced SIGH-ster--Ed.]. 
El Mouaziz took over temporarily and Jifar was the first to crack, followed by Pinto 
and Syster. At 22 miles (1:45:12) the Moroccan himself was 100m back and the race was 
down to three, and what a three: Gebrselassie, Tergat and world record holder Khannouchi. 
Along the Thames Embankment, it was Gebrselassie and Khannouchi level with Tergat 
tucked in between them, one stride behind.     
   Into the last two miles Khannouchi made a break. Tergat responded and the unthinkable
 happened: Gebrselassie was dropped. Soon Tergat fell back and again everyone started 
to look at their watches. Except, that is, Khannouchi who was not wearing one. The 
Moroccan-born American had reached 40-K in 1:59:11. When he set his 1999 world best, 
the corresponding time at that point had been 1:59:20.
   Yet Khannouchi did not let rip. He looked back frequently as he approached the 
finish and one wondered if he knew how near he was to his own worldmark. He needed to 
run the last one mile 385 yards in 5:49 and he managed 5:45 for the fabulous time of 
2:05:38. Like with Radcliffe, his spouse/manager was waiting with open arms just after 
the finish line. After that greeting from Sandra, Khalid knelt down to kiss the tarmac 
of The Mall.
   Tergat placed second in a brilliant 2:05:48, the second fastest-ever.  Gebrselassie 
clocked 2:06:35, an Ethiopian record and the fastest ever senior début, but almost 
unnoticed. In fourth place El Mouaziz set a Moroccan record, his fifth personal best 
in five London appearances. Syster cut more than six minutes from his best while Baldini, 
who never ran with the lead pack, broke his Italian record.
   "We're quite happy with the race," said the victor in what must be the understatement 
of the year. "Everything was perfect, the rabbits, the drinks and the course. We thank
 God because the weather was great."
   Some 32,847 had finished the race before the timing equipment was turned off at 
6pm, more than eight hours after the start.

   NOTE: Story by your editor --Ed.
   BOSTON (15-Apr) -- It was difficult to watch today's BAA Boston Marathon without 
a jaundiced eye after the record-smashing performances by Khalid Khannouchi and Paula 
Radcliffe in London the day before.  What excitement could the 106th trip from the green 
in Hopkinton to the Boston Public Library in Back Bay offer an experienced journalist or fan?
   Plenty.
   In heavy humidity and under cloud cover so thick that the television helicoptors 
were grounded for part of the race, Rodgers Rop and Margaret Okayo of Kenya both 
produced upset, late-race victories.  Rop, 26, running in only his second marathon, 
held off the persistent challenges of compatriot Christopher Cheboiboch to win in a 
respectable 2:09:02, his career best time.  Okayo, 25, became the first woman since Uta 
Pippig in 1994 to win the New York City and Boston marathons back-to-back, crushing 
Pippig's course record from the same year and beating two-time defending champion and
 countrywoman, Catherine Ndereba.  Okayo clocked 2:20:43, equalling the fourth-fastest performance ever by a woman on any course, while Ndereba finished in 2:21:12, also 
under Pippig's 2:21:45 record.
   "I think I prepared very well," said Rop who finished third at last fall's New York 
City Marathon where he made his debut at the distance.  "I ran 20-K in March (in Alphen 
Aan den Rhine, Netherlands).  When I ran 58 (minutes) I knew I was OK."
   With all eyes on defending champion, Lee Bong-Ju of Korea, the men's race began at 
a deliberate pace, allowing a huge pack of 22 athletes to mosey through the first half 
in 1:05:19.  Kenyan Elly Rono did most of the leading, while none of the favorites, 
including Lee, Silvio Guerra of Ecuador, Joshua Chelang'a and Fred Kiprop of Kenya and 
Laban Nkete and Abner Chipu of South Africa, fell off the pace.
   The pack was still intact through 25-K (1:17:11), but at the water station a half-
minute later Rop saw a chance to increase the pace.  
   "After 25-K it was my time to break the group," explained Rop after the race.
   The pack began to splinter, but Kiprop, Chelang'a, David Kiptum Busienei, Elias 
Chebet and Cheboiboch all followed Rop closely.  Rop's 4:38 16th mile quickly winnowed 
the pack to 14 men, and early in the 19th mile he surged again, running a 4:44 mile.  
That distilled the race to just five contenders, all Kenyans: Rop, Cheboibich, 
Chelang'a, Chebet, and Kiprop.
   Rop, who has only been running seriously since 1998 when he joined the Kenyan 
Police team, looked comfortable in the lead as the group of five held together through 
the 20 mile mark (1:38:50).  Just before 21 miles, Rop surged again and this time only
 Cheboiboch could go with him.  Then Rop ran a series of strong miles from 22 through 
24 (4:36, 4:45 and 4:43) to put Cheboiboch behind him.  His lead looked insurmountable, 
but Cheboiboch refused to give up.
   "I saw I was still strong," said the former Fila Team athlete who now represents 
Saucony.  "I thought I could catch him.  I tried."
   In the final finishing straight on Boylston Street, Rop was already backing off his 
pace and beginning to enjoy his victory.  Cheboiboch tried one last time to close the 
gap, but he simply ran out of time.  Rop crossed the finish line three seconds up on 
Cheboiboch, while Kiprop won an all out sprint against the late race charge of Mbarak 
Hussein to get third.  Both men were timed in 2:09:45.  Lee, who had fallen badly off 
the pace, regathered himself to finish fifth in 2:10:30.
   "I could have done better but I didn't see it as a bad result," said Lee who will 
be married next Sunday in Seoul's Olympic Stadium in front of 20,000 guests.
   Ndereba and Sun Yingjie of China did most of the leading early in the women's race, 
but with a five-minute downhill 16th mile in Wellesley, Okayo pulled Ndereba away from 
Sun and Ethiopian, Elfenesh Alemu.  Ever since the 15-K mark, the women were under 
Pippig's course record schedule, but by 25-K they were 40 seconds ahead and it looked 
like both Okayo and Ndereba would run under 2:21..
   "There was a lot of pressure," explained Ndereba who was looking for her third 
consecutive victory.  "Everybody was looking at me."
   Okayo knew that Ndereba had a strong kick and had no choice but to keep the pace 
high.
   "If Catherine was going to run 2:21 she was also helping me," reasoned Okayo who 
didn't mind doing most of the leading in the later miles.
   The pair ran together for nearly ten miles, running as fast as 5:09 from 23 to 24.  
The tension built with every mile.  Who would make the first move?
   Okayo waited until nearly 40-K --in the middle of the 25th mile-- to make her final 
bid for victory.  Fighting a painful right hamstring, Ndereba could not answer, and 
Okayo quickly pulled away from her Kenyan Prisons teammate.
   "I struggled to finish," said Ndereba who was gracious in defeat.  Flouting shoe 
company convention she added, "I was happy that Margaret won the race.  We come from 
the same team, the Prisons team."
   Okayo earned a $25,000 course record bonus to bring her total payday to $105,000. 
 She was happy, but seemed just a little stunned.  "I was feeling strong all the way," 
she said.  "I was comfortable.  I was running my own race."

BOSTON NOTEBOOK:
   In winning the masters race and finishing fifth overall, FIRAYA SULTANOVA of Russia 
smashed Priscilla Welch's over-40 course record in 2:27:58, winning a total of $31,500 
in prize money...  JOSHUA KIPKEMBOI got his third masters victory at Boston in three 
years, setting back defending champion FEYDOR RYJOV of Russia with a 2:12:48 clocking...  
KEITH DOWLING (15th place, 2:13:28) and JILL GAITENBY (13th place, 2:38:55) were the 
top finishers from the U.S.  Dowling ran a personal best time.  "Ignorance was bliss 
for me," he said.  "I didn't wear a watch.  With 2-K to go I knew I was going to set a 
PR.  I can't complain about that."  Gaitenby struggled with a painful heel injury which 
almost caused her to drop out of the race.  She could barely walk into the post-race 
press conference.  "I really wanted to run in the low 2:30's," she lamented.  "I think I 
limped the last two miles..."  American JOSH COX withdrew from the race suffering from 
a virus...  American CLINT VERRAN set a personal best time of 2:15:19 to finish 17th, d
espite stopping on somebody's front lawn to make a bathroom stop.  His Hansons teammate 
CHRIS WEHRMAN (22nd/2:19:03) was forced to make three such stops.
