&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> 1. Edmonton 2001 Worlds organizers extend entry deadline by 2 weeks</i>
&gt;<i> (from Steven Downes, Britain)</i>
&gt;<i> 2. Announcing the PATCO Championship races for June 25-30 (from Javier</i>

&gt;<i> 6. Subscribing to Triathlon Digest -- here's where to sign up online</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> --------------------</i>
&gt;<i> 1. EDMONTON ENTRIES: From British journo Steven Downes</i>
&gt;<i> (<a  href="mailto:stevendownes@xxxxxxx">mailto:stevendownes@xxxxxxx</a>):</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Organisers of next month's ITU World Championships in Edmonton,</i>
&gt;<i> Alberta, have extended the deadline for age group entries by two weeks, to</i>
&gt;<i> July 1, to allow more countries -- including host nation Canada -- to</i>
&gt;<i> hold qualifier events.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> A spokesman for the organisers admitted that, as at the date, they</i>
&gt;<i> had received only 500 entries age groupers of a possible total 2000. With</i>
&gt;<i> each entry bringing in $160, the $320,000 in projected fees income</i>
comprises
&gt;<i> a significant part of the organisers' budget for the event.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The success of the overall event is often contingent on the presence of a</i>
&gt;<i> large number of age groupers, who can also provide a significant boost to</i>
&gt;<i> the local economy, through spending on accommodation, eating out and on</i>
&gt;<i> specially commissioned event souvenirs, for example.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;We have extended the deadline from June 15 to July 1 because many of the</i>
&gt;<i> national federations were not holding their qualifiers until after the</i>
&gt;<i> original date and would not have had the opportunity to register,&quot; said</i>
Tara
&gt;<i> Strudwick, from Edmonton 2001, the organisers of the World</i>
&gt;<i> Championships.</i>
&gt;<i> She cited the United States, Australia and Canada as countries yet to</i>
stage
&gt;<i> qualifiers. (Actually, Triathlon Australia has already named its</i>
&gt;<i> age-group team and USAT had its second qualifying race on June 2. The</i>
&gt;<i> rest of the Canadian team will be named after the June 30-July 1</i>
&gt;<i> National Championships in Drummondville).</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;We extended the deadline for everyone to make it more fair, as all of the</i>
&gt;<i> federations now have the same deadline as countries like these.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;This extension will have no impact on qualifying performances. These are</i>
&gt;<i> still based on the same ITU platform.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;Currently, we have only about 500 age group entries of the maximum 2000</i>
&gt;<i> that we will allow,&quot; Strudwick said.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The entry deadline extension also applies to elite entries, ensuring a</i>
&gt;<i> scramble for world ranking points in the next two weeks by those</i>
&gt;<i> athletes on</i>
&gt;<i> the fringes of qualifying.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> --------------------</i>
&gt;<i> 2. ANNOUNCING PATCO CHAMPS: From Cuba's Javier Clavelo Robinson</i>
&gt;<i> (<a  href="mailto:pclavelo74@xxxxxxxxxxx">mailto:pclavelo74@xxxxxxxxxxx</a>):</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The organizing committee is pleased to invite all National Federations</i>
&gt;<i> of the Americas to the inaugural Pan American Aquathlon and Duathlon</i>
&gt;<i> Championships and the 11th Pan American Triathlon Championships, to be</i>
&gt;<i> staged under ITU rules. There is a $5,000 prize fund for the elite men</i>
&gt;<i> and women.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The Cuban Triathlon Federation has chosen the tourist resort &quot;Jardines</i>
&gt;<i> del Rey&quot; as the  venue of the event, with Tryp Cayo Coco as the</i>
&gt;<i> headquarter hotel, with events scheduled for June 25-30.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> We have set up everything to offer you a truly pleasant and happy stay</i>
&gt;<i> to make it an</i>
&gt;<i> unforgettable adventure in the Caribbean. Activities planned for the</i>
&gt;<i> week include a course on triathlon training for kids, conducted by</i>
&gt;<i> Professors Juan Hojas Dominguez and Alfredo Ranzola Rivas, a course for</i>
&gt;<i> judges, on the organization of events and a meeting of the Pan American</i>
Committee.
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The PanAm Duathlon Championship will be staged on the morning of June</i>
&gt;<i> 27, with the first PanAm Aquathlon to be staged that afternoon. Overall</i>
&gt;<i> winners in the aquathlon and duathlon will be awarded a free a week for</i>
&gt;<i> two in any  &quot;Sol Melia&quot; hotel in Cuba.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The following day will see the staging of PanAm Triathlon championships</i>
&gt;<i> for children from nine years up, with the age group races in the</i>
&gt;<i> afternoon and a kids' party in the evening.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The PanAm Triathlon Championship elite and junior elite races will be</i>
&gt;<i> staged on Friday, June 29, with a traditionally Cuban party in the</i>
&gt;<i> evening following the awards ceremony, before the planned return to</i>
&gt;<i> Havana the following day.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;Sol y Son&quot; is the event's official tour operator. All persons</i>
&gt;<i> interested in attending</i>
&gt;<i> this multisport festival, please contact &quot;Sol y Son&quot; or Cubana Airlines</i>

&gt;<i> 3. PREVIEWING WINDSOR: From Downes in London --</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> London, June 15 - It could turn out to be much more than a mere</i>
&gt;<i> pre-Europeans work-out on Sunday, as Andrew Johns and Spencer Smith clash</i>
&gt;<i> in what is regarded as Britain's premier race, the PepsiMax Windsor</i>
&gt;<i> Triathlon.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The women's race could also provide Andrea Whitcombe with the opportunity</i>
&gt;<i> to prove a point to the British selectors, although the race title could</i>
be
&gt;<i> taken out of Britain for the first time, with the presence of Denmark's</i>
&gt;<i> Lisbeth Kristensen in the field.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Former double world champion Smith returns to the event which he has won</i>
&gt;<i> six times in its 11 stagings  - including defeating Johns in 1998, just</i>
weeks
&gt;<i> before Johns went on to claim the first of his two European titles.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;Windsor has always been my favourite race,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It's great to</i>
&gt;<i> be back on my home turf in front of a British crowd.&quot;</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> This time, the Windsor event comes just a week before the pair of</i>
&gt;<i> Britain's leading triathletes are due to clash in Carlsbad, the Czech</i>
&gt;<i> spa town staging the 2001 Europeans.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The Windsor race is effectively staged in the Queen's back garden, with</i>
&gt;<i> the swim in the River Thames, and the cycle and run courses staged</i>
&gt;<i> against a</i>
&gt;<i> backdrop of Windsor Castle, Eton College and Windsor Great Park, the</i>
&gt;<i> athletes facing a stiff climb up castle hill on each of the three laps.</i>
&gt;<i> No one has yet managed to break 1hr 50min for the demanding course.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Johns, who was runner-up to Tim Don last year, has never won Windsor, and</i>
&gt;<i> may need to break the 1:50 barrier if he is to defeat Smith, who has been</i>
&gt;<i> showing good form in his races so far this season, but has suffered bad</i>
luck
&gt;<i> with technical breakdowns and course misdirection.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> &quot;It always great to race against Spencer, the battle will be close this</i>
&gt;<i> year at Windsor,&quot; said Johns, the reigning European champion.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> With Sian Brice absent on &quot;pregnancy leave&quot;, Windsor is sure to have a</i>
&gt;<i> new women's champion. Whitcombe is the latest British triathlon talent to</i>
&gt;<i> emerge, but she has been omitted from the squad for Carlsbad, and clearly</i>
&gt;<i> will have a point to prove to the British selectors, as will Heather</i>
&gt;<i> Williams and Helen Cawthorne. Although Julie Dibens is on the entry list,</i>
&gt;<i> it is thought she will drop out at T2, since she has yet to recover</i>
&gt;<i> sufficiently from a stress fracture to be able to run properly.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Whitcombe could use this race to launch her season in earnest, as in the</i>
&gt;<i> past week, as a consolation for missing Carlsbad, she has been named in</i>
&gt;<i> the British team for the European duathlon championships in Mafra,</i>
Portugal,
&gt;<i> next month, while the British Triathlon Association also offered her</i>
&gt;<i> racing opportunities in ITU events in an attempt to boost her world</i>
&gt;<i> ranking in</i>
&gt;<i> the hope that she could be entered for the triathlon World Championships</i>
in
&gt;<i> Edmonton.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Biggest threat to Whitcombe on Sunday will be Kristensen. The tall Dane,</i>
&gt;<i> winner of her age-group race at last year's Worlds, has been training in</i>
&gt;<i> Switzerland for the past two months, gearing herself up towards a debut</i>
&gt;<i> at the Ironman distance and so could have reserves of strength that</i>
&gt;<i> ultimately overpower rookie Whitcombe.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> --------------------</i>
&gt;<i> 4. NISSAN XTERRA SERIES: From XTERRA's Janet Clark</i>
&gt;<i> (<a  href="mailto:jclark@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx">mailto:jclark@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</a>):</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> The largest pro field in XTERRA's U.S. Series history has signed on for</i>
the
&gt;<i> first of this year's Nissan Xterra U.S.A. Championship Series, formerly</i>
&gt;<i> known as the XTERRA America Tour. The season kicks off June 24 in</i>
Richmond,
&gt;<i> Virginia at the Nissan Xterra East Championship, where the pursuit for one</i>
&gt;<i> of the richest purses in multisport, begins. The pro purse for the U.S.</i>
&gt;<i> Series and the Nissan Xterra World Championships will total $230,000 in</i>
&gt;<i> cash:</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra East Championship Richmond, VA June 24 $15,000</i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra Central Championship Keystone, CO July 29 $15,000</i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra West Championship Half Moon Bay, CA August 19 $15,000</i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra USA Championship Lake Tahoe, NV September 23 $30,000</i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra USA Championship Series $50,000</i>
&gt;<i> - Nissan Xterra World Championship Maui, HI October 14 $105,000</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> An accomplished field including nationally ranked triathletes, world and</i>
&gt;<i> national mountain bike champions, Ironman champions, and Olympians, will</i>
toe
&gt;<i> the line at Brown's Island in the heart of downtown Richmond. Heat and</i>
&gt;<i> humidity will be strong factors in the race, along with endurance,</i>
tenacity,
&gt;<i> skill, and equipment. This urban race will consist of a 1-k swim, a 27-k</i>
&gt;<i> mountain bike and a 10-k trail run.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> In addition to racing for $15,000 in prize monies at the Nissan Xterra</i>
East
&gt;<i> Championship, the top 15 men and women will earn points towards the</i>
&gt;<i> $50,000 Nissan Xterra U.S.A. Championship Series purse which pays off on</i>
&gt;<i> overall performance in the four race U.S. series. Every race will count</i>
for
&gt;<i> points, a change over last year when pros could drop their worst finishes</i>
&gt;<i> from the points score.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Michael Tobin and Kerstin Weule, reigning XTERRA World and Series</i>
champions
&gt;<i> will return to defend their wins at Richmond last year, along with former</i>
&gt;<i> XTERRA World Champions Ned Overend, Jimmy Riccitello, Cameron Randolph,</i>
and
&gt;<i> Shari Kain. Kain and a bumper crop of pro mountain bikers are joining the</i>
&gt;<i> U.S. series for the first time, and are expected to be a significant</i>
factor
&gt;<i> in the race at Richmond, which relies heavily on technical mountain biking</i>
&gt;<i> skills. Following in the steps of mountain bike legend, Ned Overend, are</i>
&gt;<i> national champ Steve Larsen, who blew the field away with his win at</i>
XTERRA
&gt;<i> Half Moon Bay last year, and Canadians Melanie McQuaid and Lesley</i>
Tomlinson.
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Top American triathletes competing will include Kerry Classen, winner of</i>
six
&gt;<i> events in last year's season, and a very fit Wes Hobson. 2000 XTERRA</i>
Canada
&gt;<i> champ Mike Vine will also be a factor in Richmond, where he was runner-up</i>
&gt;<i> last year. In addition to Canadian competitors, the international ranks</i>
have
&gt;<i> swelled to include pros representing Australia, New Zealand, Japan,</i>
Germany,
&gt;<i> France, and South Africa.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> --------------------</i>
&gt;<i> 5. COMMENTS ON DRUG TESTING: From Westlake, California, attorney Howard</i>
&gt;<i> Jacobs (<a  href="mailto:forgiejacobs@xxxxxxxxxxxxx">mailto:forgiejacobs@xxxxxxxxxxxxx</a>) with the firm Forgie Jacobs &amp;</i>
Leonard:
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Just a few thoughts on doping control issues, and specifically your</i>
response
&gt;<i> to Steve Locke:</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> 1.    With respect to your comment that &quot;WADA would disagree, that it is</i>
&gt;<i> WADA's responsibility to step in, with IFs merely serving as a partner</i>
&gt;<i> in the drug-fighting effort,&quot; please refer to WADA's own website:  &quot;The</i>
&gt;<i> mission of WADA is to encourage,</i>
&gt;<i> support, coordinate, and when necessary undertake the organization of</i>
&gt;<i> announced out-of-competition testing.  To promote and ensure the</i>
uniformity
&gt;<i> and equity in all sports and in all countries, WADA:  (1) determines</i>
&gt;<i> annually the number of unannounced out-of-competition controls which it</i>
will
&gt;<i> finance;  (2) organizes and conducts unannounced out-of-competition</i>
controls
&gt;<i> with the approval of and in liaison with International Federations,</i>
&gt;<i> concentrating in the first instance on the countries and sports where such</i>
&gt;<i> controls are not at present carried out;  (3) coordinates and ensures</i>
&gt;<i> harmony between such controls.&quot;</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> Clearly, WADA intends to take responsibility for the doping control</i>
&gt;<i> effort on behalf of IF's who sign on to support WADA.  The whole point</i>
&gt;<i> is to</i>
&gt;<i> have a central and independent agency focusing solely on doping control</i>
and
&gt;<i> testing.  If successful in achieving its mission, having WADA control</i>
these
&gt;<i> functions on behalf of the IF's will eliminate discrepancies in testing</i>
&gt;<i> between different sports and between different countries.  This can only</i>
be
&gt;<i> considered a good thing.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> 2.    I must also disagree with your assertion that USADA does not</i>
&gt;<i> intend to take over USAT's (and all other U.S. NFs') doping control</i>
&gt;<i> responsibilities.  In fact, in light of the following from USADA's</i>
website,
&gt;<i> I can't see how you could come to that conclusion:  &quot;USADA is the</i>
&gt;<i> independent anti-doping agency for Olympic sports in the United States,</i>
and
&gt;<i> is responsible for managing the testing and adjudication process for the</i>
&gt;<i> athletes.&quot;  In fact, recent news stories regarding the suspension of U.S.</i>
&gt;<i> track and field athlete Tony Dees reported that USADA did in fact handle</i>
the
&gt;<i> testing analysis and adjudication on behalf of USATF.</i>
&gt;<i></i>
&gt;<i> 3.    The whole point of these new, independent agencies is to take</i>
&gt;<i> doping control away from the sport's governing bodies.  In recent years,</i>
&gt;<i> IF's and NF's were roundly criticized no matter what they did with respect</i>
&gt;<i> to doping.  If a governing body did not spend the substantial resources on</i>
&gt;<i> testing and prosecution of doping positives, it was criticized for being</i>
too
&gt;<i> soft on drugs.  However, if a governing body vigorously tested and</i>
&gt;<i> prosecuted all positives, it was criticized by the athletes, who virtually</i>
&gt;<i> always argued that they were innocent, that the test was unfair or</i>
&gt;<i> inaccurate, and that they were being treated unfairly by the prosecuting</i>
&gt;<i> governing body (these complaints were often accompanied by threats to sue</i>
&gt;<i> the governing body if the athlete was exonerated, despite the fact that</i>
the
&gt;<i> governing body was doing what it was required to do -- namely, ensure to</i>
the
&gt;<i> best of its ability that the athletes have a clean and level playing</i>
&gt;<i> field).  Handing these responsibilities over to independent agencies</i>
created
&gt;<i> for this sole purpose removes the adversarial realtionship created between</i>
&gt;<i> the athletes and the governing bodies, leaving the NFs and IFs to focus on</i>
&gt;<i> administering and growing thier respective sports.</i>
