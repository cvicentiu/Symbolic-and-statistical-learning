The priest who received the nuptial vows of the first settlers
on the south shore of the Detroit River, was Father Peter Potier,
the last of the Jesuit missionaries to the Huron Indians, 1744-1781.
Father Potier survived the French Government in Canada, and under
British rule exercised the functions of the first pastor of the
parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Sandwich.

The good priest died on July 16, 1781.  "The body was interred in
the choir of the church of this parish, on the Gospel side.
The ceremony was witnessed by a very large concourse of people."
In these words the funeral is described in the ancient records
written by Rev. John Francis Hubert, pastor of Ste. Anne's Church,
Detroit, and later the Rt. Rev. Bishop of Quebec,
who sung the requiem mass over the venerable missionary of the
Huron Indians of the Detroit.  In 1846 Father Potier's remains
were transferred from "the old church of the Hurons" to the
final resting-place under the nave of the present church of the
Assumption, Sandwich.

The records of the Church of the Assumption are written in French;
they are consecutive for nearly one hundred and fifty years,
commencing in the month of May, when Father Potier wrote,
"The year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty, and
goes on to record the marriage of Frank. Morin called Valcour
and M. Magdelene Bouron in the presence of five witnesses, who
are named in the entry and who also sign the register after the
officiating priest.  A faithful copy of the entry of this first
marriage celebrated at the Church of the Assumption is given the
reader on the second page of this manuscript.

The lover of history will have noticed the interval of time
which intervenes between the date of the first marriage and the
date of the second marriage entry. Let him pause to remember that
in 1760 the flag of France still floated over Fort Pontchartrain
(Detroit); that in 1763, the south shore of the Detroit River
was the storm centre of the great Indian conspiracy of Pontiac,
having for its object the over-throw of British supremacy in Canada.

During those fateful years, although marriages were rare at the
Church of the Assumption, the records were kept, but they were
of baptisms.  In 1761 there were seven baptized; in 1762 there
were sixteen baptized; in 1763 there were twenty eight baptized,
or a total of fifty-one in the three years.

Father Potier wrote in microscopic round hand; every letter was
perfectly formed with ink true to its color; each marriage entry
occupied about a dozen lines of space and was a fine record of
family history. There is the date, the publication of banns, the
ecclesiastical dispensation if there is one (usually for
consanguinity), the name of the groom and of his father and of
his mother and from whence they came (frequently from some
parish in France), the same of the bride and of her ancestry;
the priest who officiated is described, as well as the church
where the ceremony was celebrated; the names of the witnesses,
who also sign the register, sometimes with the mark in legal
form.  In nearly every case the witness is a man, there is no
bridesmaid.

Many of the names written in the old records are well known in
history, as in a marriage celebrated on November 18th, 1780,
between Charles Fontenai de Quindre, son of Antoine Cesar de Quindre,
ecuyer  (he was colonel of Militia under French rule),
and of Francis Marie Anne Piquot&eacute; de Bellestre (sister of the
last French Commandant at Detroit), daughter of Francois Piquot&eacute;,
Sieur de Bellestre, and of Dame Catherine Trotier, and
Catherine Ch&ecirc;ne, daughter of Pierre Ch&ecirc;ne and Mary Anne Cuillerier.
Witness, Jean B. Le Duc,. Madame Trotier La Morandiere,
Antoine de Quindre, Charles de Quindre, Joseph Gouin,
Jean Louis de Quindre, Madame La Morandiere de Quindre,
Mary Catherine Ch&ecirc;ne, Charles Gerin.

Father Potier was a Belgian; he was not familiar with the orthography
of French names, and in his register, which I faithfully
copied in this manuscript, there are many mistakes in spelling
names, such as "Morin" for Morand; "Gaudet" for God&eacute;; "Ro" for Rau;
"Janis" for Janisse; "Saliot" for Saliotte; "Go&iuml;au" for Goyeau;
"Boimie" for Boismere; "Godefroi" for Godefroy; "Fontenai" for Fontenoy;
"Rochelot" for Rocheleau; "Des Hetres" for Des Hestres;
"Du Roseau" for Du Rocher; "L'antailla" for Antaya; "Giolette" for Ouellette;
"Etien" for Etienne (Stephen); "L'Anglois" for Langlois, etc.

The descendants of these first settlers in the parish of the
Assumption are numerous in Essex of to-day; they retain the
land and the language of their fathers.  French sermons are
preached on Sunday in many of the churches throughout the
county, but in local life the language of the school playground
is the language of the people, and that is English.

BAPTISMS (1761 TO 1786), MARRIAGES (1782 TO 1786), AND

DEATHS (1768 TO 1786), RECORDED IN THE PARISH

REGISTERS OF ASSUMPTION, SANDWICH.
</center></b>


The Essex Historical Society, believing that a perusal of the
above would possess more than local interest, applied to the
proper authority and were kindly permitted to copy from the
parish registers the baptisins, marriages and deaths as therein
recorded, and now present a portion for a period of about
twenty-five years as above.

Much might be written about this old and historic parish, but a
few facts will have to suffice here. Its history is certainly
unique, dating back to 1767, and being for many years under the
jurisdiction of the Bishop of Quebec. It is one of the earliest
parishes of the many established by the Jesuit missionaries in
the old Province of Canada.

Its origin is connected with a mission of Hurons or Wyandottes
which was founded in 1728 by Father Armand de la Richardie, a
Jesuit, who had previously started a mission of the Hurons at
Detroit to the number of six hundred, all of whom he had converted.

In 1803 the parish was called the Assumption of La Pointe-de-Montreal
or L'Assumption du Detroit.

In 1742 the Huron village was removed to Bois Blanc Island,
opposite Amherstburg, and in 1744 an assistant was given to
Father Richardie in the person of Father Pierre Potier. Father
Richardie remained between Detroit and Pointe-de-Montreal until
about 1751. It is believed that about this time the first
mission house or chapel was erected at the latter place.

In 1767 the mission, including both French and Indians, was
erected into a parish under the name of L'Assomption de la
Pointe de Montreal or L'Assomption du Detroit. Father Potier
remained in charge until his death in 1781. He was succeeded by
Rev. M. Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Hubert who was sent by the Bishop of Quebec.
Shortly after his arrival a new church was built on the land
given by the Hurons.

On his departure for Quebec in 1788 the parish was under the care
of Rev. M. Frechette, parish priest of St. Anne's, Detroit, for
a short time, when Rev. F. M. X. Dufaux was appointed and
remained for ten years. The present handsome church was
commenced during the pastorate of the Rev. Angus McDonell in
1843, and finished a few years afterwards.

The marriages recorded in this parish from 1761 to 1782, during
the pastorate of Rev. Father Potier, are not included here, as
the same form a portion of a paper read by Miss Margaret Claire
Kilroy, at the annual meeting of the Ontario Historical Society
at Niagara, 1905, and are given at page 28.
