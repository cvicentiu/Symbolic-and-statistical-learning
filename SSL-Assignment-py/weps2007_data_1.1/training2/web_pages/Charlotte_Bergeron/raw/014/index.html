<P><IMG SRC="QuebecFlagStatic.gif" HSPACE=4 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=62 WIDTH=97 ALIGN=RIGHT>2.  <B><A NAME="Pierre">Pierre</A><SUP>2</SUP> Gareman dit lePICARD</B> (Pierre<SUP>1</SUP> GAREMAN) was born Abt. 1600 in Bagneux, Picardie, FR, and died Aft. Jun 10, 1653 in Cap Rouge, Quebec.  He married <B>Madeleine CHARLOT</B> 1628 in Bagneux, Soissons, Picardie, FR.  She was born Abt. 1600 in France, and died Abt. Jan 29, 1652 in St. Pierre du Sud, Montmagny, Quebec.

<P>Notes for Pierre lePicard dit GAREMAN:
<BR>The following paragraphs taken (and chronologically reorganized) from James Carten's postings:
<BR>In 1628, Pierre Gareman of Bagneux, Picardie married Marguerite Charlot. Their first child arrived in 1629 and their second in 1631, they were girls, Florence and Nicole. This little family migrated to Quebec before the birth and baptism of their third daughter, Marguerite, in 1639. They had, Charles, their only son in 1643. They baptized Charles in Trois-Rivieres.  
<BR>According to Marcel Trudel (Terrier,p.307), the Gareman was in the region of Portneuf from 1640 to work in the service of Jacques Le Neuf de la Poterie. A short time later, around 1642, the Iroquois forced them to take refuge in Sillery, at the hospice. It was about the same era that Pierre stayed sometime in Trois-Rivieres. He shows up as a witness in 1643. The 25-05-1646, the seigneur Le Neuf came back again and signed with Gareman and Rene Mezeray a contract that incites them to take up where they left off in Portneuf. This contract did not have the desired follow-up because Mr. de la Poterie will declare in 1668 that the Iroquois danger obliged him and "many of his tenant farmers, had to abondon the area twenty years ago" because the buildings were burned," in which they suffered notable losses that cost him a lot to presently settle and could not do it earlier because there were no troops in the country" (The Carignan Reg.). The historian Trudel concludes that the occupation of the area is not yet really underway before 1663, because the only two known residants at that time are Pierre Gareman and Rene Mezerets dit Nopce.
<BR>In 1652 or before, the Compagnie des Cent-Associes granted to Pierre Gareman some land of four arpents wide on the (St. Lawrence) river, to which originally was twelve and a half arpents deep, and later to fifty. [In 26-03-1656, the inheritors will sell this land with buildings to Etienne Letellier, for the sum of 300 pounds. This property, today, takes up the major part of the parishes of Ste.Ursule and St. Benoit at the western end of the city of Ste. Foy.]
<BR>In 10-06-1653, when he was living at Cap Rouge with his family, Pierre and his son Charles, 8 years old, are captured by the Iroquois. In the Histoire De Notre-Dame de Ste.Foy, the priest H.-A. Scott writes (pp.295-296):" the 10-06-1653, Francois Boule, called Petit Homme, was working in his field, which bordered on that of Rene Mezerets, when he was hit by three gunshots, one in the stomach, in the groin, and in the thigh, then scalped. His other neighbor, Pierre Gareman, called the Picard, had a consequence even more sad, as he was taken alive with his son Charles, of eight years, and a young man named Hugues Couturier, and reserved to these terrible tortures so often written about. 
<BR>The Jesuit Journal also tells about the attack on 10-06-1653 by the Onieda tribe of the Iroquois on Cap Rouge. The Journal refers to ten year old son, Charles.  The Iroquois did not approve of men letting themselves be captured. They usually tortured and killed them, as they did with our Pierre Gareman.

<P>Notes for Madeleine CHARLOT:
<BR>Ancetres by Jacques Saintonge #162 says that Madeleine Charlot died before 1652, leaving a young family for Pierre Gareman to look after.  Jette, pg 464, says Madeleine Charlot was also captured by the Hurons, 05-05-1660.  She got away, but was dangerously wounded, dying later.  (my NOTE:  which is correct?)

<P>Notes for Nicole Madeleine Garman:
<BR>Some info is from Jette.  Also, James Carten posted this in regards to Nicole:  Pierre's daughter, Nicole Gareman, born in 1631 in Picardie, signed a marriage contract with Jacques Delauney.  Because of a change of heart she cancelled the contract in 1644. The young widower Rene Mezeray probably was the cause of her change of heart. He married her in Quebec in 1645. In 1659 she was confirmed in the Catholic Church. Ref: "One Hundred French-Canadian Families",p. 167,168, by Phillip Moore.

<P>Notes for Charles Gareman:
<BR>James Carten's posting says that the Jesuit Journal tells us that on the 10-06-1653 the Onieda tribe of the Iroquois attacked Cap Rouge. They took three captives, a young man Hugues le Cousturier, Pierre Gareman and his ten year old son, Charles.  Captive children were raised as members of the tribe. This is what they did with Charles Gareman. Charles married an Onieda woman named Marie Gonnentenne and was living in an Onieda village, upstream from Quebec in 1677. That year he took his daughter Louise to Quebec for baptism. He left her with the Ursuline nuns. Louise died there in 1683. Nothing more is known of Charles Gareman.

<P>Notes for Gilles Antoine CAOUETTE:
<BR>The Kamouraska site says that Gilles was in Quebec in 1753, in Montreal in 1768, and in Bonaventure in 1772.  He died at age 77.
<BR>Robert (Bob) Chenard, at his homepage says this about the origins of the Caouette name:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Our Celtic ancestors were an Indo-European race that can be traced mainly to the Danube basin. They settled parts of Ireland, France, and England as early as 1,000 BC where they established townships and usually fortified them. These Celts eventually had two major dialects of which remnants still exist in parts of Wales, Ireland, and the Brittany region of France. This was the Gaelic tongue. It might interest some of you that the names Quirion, Quemeneur (now Laflamme), Caouette, Helie (now Breton) among others are names which are rooted in Gaelic (i.e., Celtic). In earlier times, these names were spelled with a "K" such as Kevilon, Kemeneur, and Ka-ouet."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Another source has indicated that Antoine (Caillouette) Caouet and Madeleine Methot are listed as the father of Francois.  (my NOTE:  was Gilles married twice?)
