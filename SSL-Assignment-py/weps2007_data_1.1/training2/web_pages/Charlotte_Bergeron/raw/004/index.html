<b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Grandmother
Mabel Belongia McTavish died at the age of 98 years old in December of
2000 at the Oconto Nursing home.&nbsp; That event sent my sister Sandra
O’Connor and myself off on a quest for our families history!&nbsp; Our
family has deep roots in the Oconto area, my mother being from Lena, and
my father Oconto, and I have always felt deep affection for the city.&nbsp;
My mother’s sister Gen Lane had already handled most of the Neta/Maternoski
research, so we first set off in search of our Belongia/Belanger roots.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were astonished when this research took us to a Canada where only 100
Europeans lived in the early 1600’s.&nbsp; Our Belongia heritage was everything
that French-Canada is!&nbsp; From Iroquois Indian raids, to Fur trading
ancestors, these roots settled in Quebec and Acadia (Nova Scotia) and made
the country the French speaking civilization it is today!&nbsp; We were
aghast to learn that Nova Scotia was once French Acadia, and that is was
our Ancestor Germain Doucet who lost the Island to the British and then
it became Nova Scotia.&nbsp; Another ancestor, Abraham Martin, had the
land he settled on become known as the Plains of Abraham.&nbsp; Many battles
of the Revolutionary war were fought on this land.&nbsp; Unfortunately
most of our ancestors were on the losing side of these battles……(never
could pick the right side).</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only branch of the family who lived in Colonial America took off for
Prince Edward Island in Canada before the outbreak of the Revolution!&nbsp;
And a daughter of that branch married into another family that fled the
United States after the war, when for some reason Revolutionary War soldiers
who fought for the British were not very welcome!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is about where the Scotch branch of the family comes into the picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once again, we participated in the losing side of the battle when our 5th
great-grandfather fought against the English in the Battle of Culloden.&nbsp;
In order to obtain forgiveness and keep his head, he volunteered to fight
with the Fraser Highlanders as a Lieutenant in the French and Indian war
in the American colonies.&nbsp; It was in his stay here that he realized
what promise American had, and he sent his son Simon McTavish to American
to learn the fur trade.&nbsp; It was this Simon McTavish who was the guiding
force of the Northwest Company, a fur trading company who had roots inside
of Wisconsin.&nbsp; When Simon died, he left money to his extended family
and it was with this that Donald McTavish left Scotland and immigrated
to the Gaspe Peninsula of Canada.&nbsp; And it was this Simon, the son
of Donald that made his way to Oconto, where he settled and bought the
Richard House in Oconto.&nbsp; The family was finally vindicated when Simon’s
son, my grandfather Frank, finally fought on a winning side, when he served
with the Rainbow division of WWI.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile times were changing in East Europe and the floodgate of immigrates
opened and the Neta’s Lorangs, Nehrenhausens, Maternoski’s, arrived in
the Oconto area, bringing with them the customs of their countries and
marrying into the old settled Oconto families.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look
forward to sharing this information and helping others with their research.&nbsp;
I appreciate corrections, and look forward to meeting some long lost cousins!</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In 1643, one hundred and nine
years after the first unloadings of Cartier, there were only three hundred
immigrants in Quebec. Twenty years later, only five hundred people. France
finally decided to grant ground premiums to two thousand other immigrants
during the decade 1663-1673. The young marriages were encouraged and thus
boys of with the more dix-hiut years married some fourteen year old girls.
The trade of the furs developed and attracted French immigrants, as well
the noble ones as the commoners. Thus in 1671, one counted more than seven
French miles to Quebec and approximately five hundred people in Acadie.
Among those, let us note the presence of Julien Laure says the Mountain
(1654-1724) and of its wife Anne Girouard. This flood of French immigration
poursuiva until 1759, year of the Conquest by the British.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The treaty of Utrech, in 1713,
yielded the acadian and French colonies to the English. In 1755, two thousand
Acadian French-speaking people refuse to lend oath of allegiance to the
Queen of England and are thus off-set mainly in Louisiana. It is however
about this period that one sees appearing the first LAURE and LORD in the
area of Mauricie. Indeed, Jean-baptiste Lord took wife with Yamachiche,
in 1733, in the person of Marie-Josephte G&eacute;linas. As of this period
a branch distinct from the LORD family will be maintained there until our
days.</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The original family surname
for both families is SICARD. However the Sicard-de-Carufel added the "dit"
name after the land they were granted in Fauch near Albi in France. Descendants
of that branch who lived in Maskinonge, Quebec also used the "de Carufel"
and named the fief. At the time of the birth of their fifth child, Louis,
in March 1705, Jean and Genevi&egrave;ve were living in Maskinonge in the
seigneurie des Legardeur de Repentigny. The Governor, Marquis Philippe
de Rigaud de Vaudreuil (1703-1726) and the intendant Fran&ccedil;ois de
Beauharnois officially granted Jean Sicard the fief de Carufel on April
21, 1705 in an "Acte de concesson. Some sources list Antoine Sicard as
the son of Jean and Genevieve Rate and as the spouse of Madeleine Abel
Barbe. There is, however, no record, in the PRDH (Universtiy of Montreal)
data (based on extracts from Quebec Church Registrys). According to their
records Jean and Genevieve's children born before 1766 were Ursule, Marie-Anne,
Jean, Joseph,Louis, Agathe, Genevieve, Francois, Elisabeth Isabelle Marie,
Pierre Amador and Marie Madeleine. They do, however, have an Antoine born
abt 1712, son of Jean-Baptiste [Simon] SICARD and Isabelle Elizabeth LEGARDEUR
DEREPENTIGNY who married Marie-Madeleine BARBE ABEL. Their children were
Antoine, Pierre, Charles, Joseph, Marie-Barbe, Francoise Louise Marie and
Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste Simon SICARD was born around 1656 in Poitou,
Vendee, FRANCE to Nicolas SICARD and Michelle BOBINE -- not a descendant
of Pierre SICARD and Marie DE FARGUES.</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Fran&ccedil;ois Baribeau is
one of the many ancestors of whom we now little or nothing concerning parental
or regional origins. Some genealogists maintain that he must have come
from Saintonge. According to Father Archange Godbout, this master cobbler,
born about 1636, arrived in Canada around 1670 with his wife Perrine Moreau
and his ten year old son Louis. The year 1670 is little more than an educated
guess, based on the supposition that the family crossed the Atlantic no
later than 1669. In fact, on 18 January 1670, the notary Romain Becquet
arranged a contract of service between Baribeau and the Jesuits. By this
time, the family had settled in the area of Qu&eacute;bec, probably at
Charlesbourg, where their first daughter, Gabrielle, was born in early
1673. On 24 February of that same year, Francois turned in his resignation
to Brother Joseph Bousier of the Society of Jesus.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Later on around 1974-1975, he
turned over his belongings in the Qu&eacute;bec region and moved to the
Batiscan shore. On 15 January 1677, our ancestor acquired a property from
Jean Lariou dit Lafontaine. It was mentioned in the census of 1681 as the
land belonging "to Fran&ccedil;ois Baribeau, a 45 year old cobbler and

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Attack at Oyster River:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It was the end of June, 1694
when Villieu and Thury, with one Frenchman and 105 Indians, began their
long canoe-voyage to the English border. The savages were directed to give
no quarter and told that the prisoners already in their hands would ensure
the safety of their hostages in the hands of the English. More warriors
were to join them from Bigot's mission on the Kennebec.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>On the ninth of July they neared
Pemaquid; but it was no part of the plan to attack a garrisoned post. The
main body passed on at a safe distance; while Villieu approached the fort,
dressed and painted like an Indian and accompanied by 2 or 3 genuine savages,
carrying a packet of furs as if on a peaceful errand of trade. Such visits
from Indians had been common since the treaty and while his companions
bartered their beaver skins with the unsuspecting soldiers, he strolled
about the neighborhood and made a plan of the works. The party was soon
joined by Bigot's Indians and the united force now amounted to 230. The
held a council to determine where they should make their attack, but opinions
differed. Some were for the places west of Boston and others for those
nearer at hand. Necessity decided them. Their provisions were gone and
Villieu says that he himself was dying of hunger. They therefore resolved
to strike at the nearest settlement, that of Oyster River, now Durham,
about 12 miles from Portsmouth. They cautiously moved forward and sent
scouts in advance who reported that the inhabitants kept no watch. In fact
a messenger from Phips had assured them that the war was over and that
they could follow their usual vocations without fear.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Villieu and his band waited till
night and then made their approach. There was a small village - a church,
a mill, 12 fortified houses occupied in most cases only by families and
many unprotected farmhouses, extending several miles along the stream.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The Indians separated into bands
and stationing themselves for a simultaneous attack at numerous points,
lay patiently waiting towards day. The moon was still bright when the first
shot gave the signal and the slaughter began. The two palisaded houses
of Adams and Drew, without garrisons were taken immediately. The wife and
daughter Mercy were captured and the rest of families butchered.</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois was a carpenter.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois Pelletier follows his
parents until 1659. The Pelletier family lived in Quebec from 1637 to 1649.
On the 22nd of March 1649, Nicolas purchased a "concession dans la Seigneurie
Des Sauvages" at Cap Rouge, approx. 7 miles south of Quebec. In 1650, two
Iroquois attacked Nicolas in his house at Cap Rouge but luckily he survived.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois doesn't leave his parents
until 1659. He leaves on the 3rd of February 1659 with his brother-in-law
Noel Jeremie. Jeremie had married Francois' sister Jeanne on the 29th of
January 1659 and was moving to Tadoussac to work as a clerk. Francois is
said to be the first white settler of Lac St-Jean. He married Dorothee
la Sauvagesse, an Indian in April 1660, Father Albanel married the couple.
Dorothee was to die on the 13th of April 1661 at L'Hopital de Quebec, possibly
while giving birth. She was buried in the Hospital basement. Francois remarried
the following year to Madeleine Morriseau. When he remarried, Francois
Pelletier used the name Antaya for the first time.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Antaya is an Indian word that
Francois Pelletier added to his name as a "dit" name. It was a French as
well as Scottish tradition to add a clan name to their family names. The
first time the name Antaya was written down was in 1667 by a notary, he
wrote Francois Pelletier dit Nontay. The same notary wrote another contract
in 1669 and wrote Anthaia. Again, in 1678, the same notary wrote Anthaya
on a different contract. Finally, in church records in St Pierre de Sorel
in 1748, the name was written as Antailla.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>On the 30th of May 1660, Francois
purchased a "concession" (land) at Tadoussac and worked as a clerk at the
Poste de Traite. On the 11th of May, 1661, Francois accompanied Jesuit
fathers Gabrielle Druilette &amp; Claude Dablon, adventurers Guillaume
Couture, Denis Guyon, notary Pierre Duquet, Jean Langlois and Michel Leneuf,
Sieur de Lavalliere. They and a few hundreds Indians left Quebec in 80
canoes. Sickness slowed down their progress and they had to spend a few
extra days in Tadoussac. The road they followed was almost identical to
the road that Father de Quen took in 1647. They rested 7 or 8 days alongside
the Lac St-Jean. On the 19th of June 1661, they paddled up the Chamouchouane
river, known as Nikouba which they renamed themselves as the Saint-Sacrement
river. The expedition stopped at Lake Nikabau. They were planning to go
to the Hudson Bay but had to turn around at the beginning of July when
their Indian guides refused to go any further. Francois returned to Quebec
with the expedition as the Poste de Traite at Tadoussac had been burned
by the Iroquois.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois Pelletier-Antaya at
Fort Saurel - 1670 (Saurel is the old French for Sorel). Francois moved
to Fort Saurel with his wife Marguerite Morisseau and his children in 1670.
The five remaining children were born in Saurel. Catherine (1670), Michel
(1674), Jean-Baptiste-Pierre (20July1676), Elisabeth (18Sep1677), and Louise
(22Sep1678). They had a total of 10 children, eight of them married. Francois
received at least 2 pieces of land (concessions) from the Seigneur Pierre
de Saurel. He sold one in 1677 and exchanged the other one to one of his
nephews, Jean-Francois in 1690. This nephew was killed by the Iroquois
at Saurel on the Nov. 2nd, 1692.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Francois Belanger:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Probably from St-Thomas de Touques,
Pont-L'Eveque, Lisieux, Normandie, France based on his probable relationship
to Nicolas Belanger dit Catherine who is from that place.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>died between 10/25/1685 and 4/25/1687</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Captain of the militia of Beaupre
1663-1677</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Granted the Seigneurie of Bonsecours
at L'Islet 7/1/1677</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>he came to Quebec in 1636 (1634?)
MARRIED in 1637 and spelled his name Bellanger.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The expedition from France to
the New France happened in 1634 when many families came over togethor to
settle.&nbsp; In 1627 the population of New France was about one hundred
of which 10 were woman.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In 1634 recruiters were promising
large farms to all who immigrated to New France. Fran&ccedil;ois probably
signed a three year contract with Robert Giffard, Lord of the Beauport
Seigneurie, in Mortagne. On 27 june 1636 Fran&ccedil;ois signs his marriage
contract with Marie Guion, daughter of Jean Guyon and Mathurine Robin,
who was 12 years of age at the time. Born in the parish of Saint-Jean of
Mortagne, and the fourth child of ten, she made the crossing in 1634 or
1636. They married the following year on 12 July 1637 in the church of
Our Lady of Recouvrance. Fran&ccedil;ois and Marie had twelve children
and all except those born after 1658, the year a new church was built,
were baptised at Qu&eacute;bec.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In addition to being a mason
by trade, Fran&ccedil;ois also cleared land and was a courageous colonist
who, to assure the well being of himself and his family, transformed his
land in Ch&acirc;teau-Richer and the one at Bonsecours into farm land.
He cut, stumped and cleared land using the instruments available at the
time which made every step gained a difficult task. All the time he was
clearing land he had to be diligent of Iriquois and Agniers who came as
foxes, attacked like lions and fled like birds. A firearm always at the
ready, this chore of land clearing took our ancestor many years. This occupied
his time at the Beauport Seigneurie from 1634 to 1637 for his farm, lot
58, and Ch&acirc;teau-Richer from 1640 during three years in association
with his neighbor Masse Gravel.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>This clearer of land also gave
birth to institutions. Who was Fran&ccedil;ois as a public official? He
quickly gained the confidence of his fellow citizens who named him, because
of his administrative and management talents, agent (1653), merchant (1658-1662),
executor for the goods of Oliver Le Taredif (1662), captain of the militia
(1666), and even a land surveing consultant. From 1653, Fran&ccedil;ois
Bellenger is more visible in public life. By his participation in these
institutions and in the community, he helped the development of the country,
Many generations imitated him in social as well as political arenas.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Our ancestor was equally suited
to present his ideas and defend them, to the notaries of the day, and before
the Sovereign Council, the supreme court of law in matters of justice.
As a matter of fact, his numerous encounters with his neighbors and many
encounters with other aspects of law resulted in his being a legendary
character: Fran&ccedil;ois Bellenger was rarely without a good argument
or reply. The years 1670 and 1674 are full of many such occurances. In
1670, he reconciled accounts with his associate and brother in law, Simon
Guyon, before the Sovereign Council who ordered him to pay his brother
in law.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>His dealings with Masse Gravel
on the subject of his land boundaries (1674) shows him as a staunch defender
of his rights but respectful of authority. He was a determined man who
followed his convictions to the end, no matter the results. As a punishment
for his audacity, the Sovereign Council, in 1670, ordered him to apologize
to Masse Gravel in another dispute which was settled by litigation. In
addition, the high court ordered him to pay court costs and pay three livres
(money of the day) to the hospital.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>This picture of our ancestor
would be incomplete unless we mentioned his social demeanor which is revealed
by
the godparents at baptisms and witnesses at weddings. This trait of his
social being crosses all sectors of society including political, economic,
religious, business and even includes Amerindian culture. On 18 september
1674, it is Sir Louis de Buade of Frontenac, Governor, who signs as witness
on the marriage contract for his daughter Mathurine with Jean Maheu. Numerous
others signed; Jacques de Chambly, notary and scribe Paul Vachon. The most
affluencial merchant of the period, Charles Aubert de la Chesnaye, shows
confidence in him and lends him monetary advances to embellish his home.
His credit, as we would say today, was excellent.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>We can't know our ancestor without
questioning his fortune and his way of life. The census of 1666, 1667 and
1681 record his goods and show him as a very financially secure person,
given the criteria of the day. In 1666 he pays his daughter Mathurine's
tuition at the Ursulines of Qu&eacute;bec, and he hires two domestic servants.
In 1667, he owns 13 bovines and land equal in value to 50 acres. In 1681,
at the establishment of his Seigneurie at Bonsecours given to him in 1667,
the census lists three servants, five guns, three cows, and four acres
of land value. To evaluate his fortune, we must also consider his accounts
payable and receivable in money or goods. Such an accounting must also
consider the doweries of his six girls. This accounting would require a
more detailed report. Would we say that, after 53 years of hard labor on
North American soil, he had attained his dream of being rich in 1634? Was
it worth the pain of immigration? We must say, Yes.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In the end, the answer to the
question asked at the start about who is Fran&ccedil;ois Bellenger, is
answered by Frontenac and Duchesneau, Governor and Overseer of the Colony
respectively, who, to repay him at the age of 64, convey to Fran&ccedil;ois
the Seigneurie of Bonsecours. A simple mason at his arrival in 1634, he
becomes a successful Seigneur in July 1677. So, the dream of 1660 where
he signed, "Lord in part of the coast of Beaupr&eacute;" was realised.
The gesture and confidence of the King of France, through his intermediaries
and representatives, was eloquent. All could see, by these gifts and confidences,
that his value in money and possessions for him and his descendants was
a confirmation of his worth as a result of his social and political qualities.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>While others obtained land grants
by buying them, Fran&ccedil;ois got his by merit. His title is not one
which is unique but represents an accomplishment much greater than could
have been imagined at the start. The honor was better realised by his son
Louis and spouse Catherine Le Fran&ccedil;ois. Fran&ccedil;ois and Marie
Guion retire with their son Jacques in 1685. Fran&ccedil;ois died between
this date of retirement and the winter of 1687, the year when Marie Guion
ratified again their will. She was buried the first of September 1696 at
Cap St-Ignace at the age of 78, as recorded by her burial record.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In conclusion, a last question:
What is the heritage of Fran&ccedil;ois and Marie Guion? What picture do
the children and grandchildren portray? 314 years after his death (1687-2001),
what picture do we paint of this pioneer? Fran&ccedil;ois left behind a
respectful heritage and family name. Knowing this man allows us to envision
his life, toil and accomplishments during his lifetime. It behooves us,
now, to look into more details of these qualities.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois arrived in Canada in
the spring of 1634, after a long 2 month voyage landing at the tiny hamlet</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>that the colony of Quebec was
at the time.&nbsp; There were 35 people in that party that departed France,
incl.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Robert Giffard, Jean Guyon,
Zacharie Cloutier and himself from the small community of Perche, France.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>On July 27, 1636 Francois Belanger
put his signature on the 1st marriage contract to be drawn up in Canada.&nbsp;
It was drawn up by Jean Guyon, notary royal of Canada for Robert Drouin
&amp; Anne Cloutier and is the oldest marriage contract preserved in the
original in Canada. Francois Belanger &amp; Marie Guyon were married on
July 12, 1637 in a ceremony along with Robert Drouin &amp; Anne Cloutier.&nbsp;
This would be the first double marriage ceremony celebrated in Canada,
as well as the first signed contract of marriage.&nbsp; Others had not
been signed by the participants, as most could not write.&nbsp; Francois
countersigned this contract as a witness &amp; friend of Robert Drouin.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Where Francois originated from
in France is not exactly known, but a baptismal record was found in the
parish register of St. Pierre de Sayez, Orne, France and reads as follows
:&nbsp; "On October 7, 1612, was baptised Francois Belanger, son of Francois
Belanger and Francoise Horlays.&nbsp; He was named by the Hon. Francois
Dumesnil, lord notrary, Lord of St. Teny.&nbsp; Present were the Hon. Nicolas
Bougis, Lord of Fosses, and controler and Lady Loyse Gurou, wife of the
noble Guillaume Lepaulnier, notary, Lord of the Chapel."&nbsp; There is
nothing to verify that this is the baptismal record of Francois Belanger
that came to Canada.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Francois was not long in Canada
when he met &amp; courted Marie Guyon, daughter of Jean Guyon &amp; Mathurine
Robin.&nbsp; They had 12 children, of which 10 had children of their own.&nbsp;
Francois was Captain de Milice de Beaupre, 1663-1677 and later Seigneur
de Bonsecours(a L'Islet).&nbsp; In 1677 Francois accepted a concession
of land &amp; a position as Seigneur de Bonsecours, which would later become
L'Islet. The Company of New France granted Francois with a "Seigneury"
consisting of 1000 arpents of land (equal to 1250 acres) which was later
passed down to his son Charles Belanger.&nbsp; While there is much history
written about this property, we know that Francois &amp; Marie would give
up their farm &amp; buildings at L'Ange-</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Gardien to their son Charles
as their new grant was located on the south side of the river.&nbsp; It
should be</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>noted here that the property
at L'Ange-Gardien is still owned by a descendant of Charles Belanger.&nbsp;
The</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>property at Bonsecours, now
L'Islet would eventually come under the hand of Louis Belanger, he would</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>be the first Seigneur of L'Islet.&nbsp;
As the result of the split up of land among his brothers &amp; sisters,
he was also a part owner of the Seigneurie of Bonsecours, which belonged
to his father Francois.&nbsp; It is not hard to find documentation on Louis
as he is responsible for the deeding of land where the church of Notre
Dame de Bonsecours now stands, as well as the property for the cemetery
across the street from the</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>We do know that they were granted
a lot right next to the walls of the fort at Port-Royal. This lot was expropriated
from their heirs in 1705 in order to expand the fort. Simon was dead within
a few years of his arrival in Acadia. Simon may have been a casualty of
the Acadian Civil War. His death, about 1644 or 1645, certainly raises
the possibility that he was among the slain.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In 1645 Perrine Bourg remarried
to Rene Landry dit L'Aine. She had at least five children by her second
marriage. Perrine was born in France about 1626. She was probably about
14 or 15 when she married. At this time, in Acadia, there also was a settler
named Antoine Bourg. He is the ancestor of thousands of people named Bourque,
Bourgue, Bourke, etc. Perrine is probably either a daughter or sister of
Antoine Bourg, but no documentation has been found to prove which. It is
possible, but not probable, that she is unrelated to Antoine Bourg. Perrine
is listed as 45 on the 1671 census. She is erroneously listed as 74 on
the 1686 census and her age is given as 67 on the 1693 census. She was
a widow again by 1678 when Rene Landry dit L'Aine died. In 1693 she is
listed as living in the house of her son Claude Landry. She is not mentioned
again and probably was dead by the 1701 census.</font></font></b>

He is listed in the Acadian census of 1671, 1686 &amp; 1693.&nbsp; There
is a separate descent of marriage going back to Indian.&nbsp; It can be
found in Nova Scotia at Chapel Island Indian reservation.&nbsp; Noel Doucet
, former president of the union of Nova Scotia Indians claims such a descent.&nbsp;
Chapel Island is North near Cape Breton.&nbsp; In 1671 Germain&nbsp; is
registered as a labourer (meaning farmer) at age 30, with his wife, age
24, three children, Charles 6, Bernard 4, Laurent 3, eleven horned cattle,
seven sheep, three arpents of cultivated land.&nbsp; The census of 1693

Jeanne de Voissy or du Roussy, age 22, his two sons, Jean, age 3 and Francois
age 1 arrived at Quebec on the 11th of June 1636 aboard a vessel carrying
45 people. The captain of that vessel was Savinien Courpon de la Tour...who
would become the Admiral of the Fleet the following year. Some names of
the other passengers were: Charles Huot de Montmagny, Champlain's successor,
Achille Brehant dit Deslisle, 7 Jesuits and numerous other Frenchmen and
their families. Our ancestors were amongst the first white settlers in
New France (Quebec today). In the 1642 census, there were less than 200
people and 6 of them were Nicolas Pelletier, his wife and 4 children. We
can truly say that our family is one of the pioneer families of Canada.</font></font></b>

the same year. Arriving on the same ship is Charles Huault-de-Montmagny,
the new governor general of New France, succeeding Champlain.</font></font></b>

is attacked by 2 Iroquois Indians, but Nicolas successfully defends his
family and the homestead against the intruders.</font></font></b>

from France on the sailboat "Le Sallemande" at Tadoussac on Aug. 30, 1620.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Martin may have been of Scottish
descent or he might have used the sobriquet if he had been enrolled in
military service or had been a member of an illegal organization: such
names were used for deserted soldiers or in case the records of an illegal
organization were seized. It is also possible that he acquired the name
because he had made several voyages to Scotland as a young man.One of the
things that does seem very indicative of why and how it may be that he
is called "l'ecossais"--which means "the Scot" (just remember that Scot
is the person, Scotch is the drink) is that from before the time of Mary,
Queen of Scots and for a century or more after her time Scots fled to France
as their ally against England. Whole generations of Scots nobility and
military men were forced to live out their lives on foreign soil. So, possibly
our Martin was one of these exiles who had become more French than Scots
before he went to Quebec. The French probably called him the Scot because
he was likely born in Scotland. Most likely he was taken as a baby or young
child to France. Given that he was perhaps born ca 1570-1590 that puts
him square in the time frame to have been the son of a Scot who fled to
France during the Protestant upsurge in Scotland. Certainly, he was of
a Catholic family and that meant that his life might have been in danger
at that time in Scotland. This seems a very possible explanation for his
designation as "the Scot." It is said that his father was a supporter of
Mary, Queen of Scots, and was involved in a plot to free her from the English.
The plot failed and they had to leave Scotland and seek refuge in France
There is some question as to whether Martin was really an official pilot
or not, although he was referred to as "kings pilot" in his own day. However,
he did fish well down into the Gulf of the St-Lawrence.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It is presumed that the Plains
(or Heights) of Abraham are named after Martin. It is picturesquely said
that the "C&ocirc;te d'Abraham" was the path that Martin used to the St.
Charles River to water his animals. His property amounted to 32 acres in
all, 12 received from the Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France in 1635 and 20
as a gift from Sieur Adrien du Chesne, ship's surgeon to Pierre Legardeur
de Repentigny in 1645. The Martin family sold this land to the Ursulines
in 1667. It is possible that this is the same Martin who was employed by
Jean De Biencourt and Du Gua de Monts as navigator on the coast of Acadia,
although he would have been very young at that time. When David Kirk captured
Quebec in 1629 and left his brother Lewis as governor until 1632, Martin
and his family stayed on. In his later years Martin fell in the estimation
of his fellow citizens when he was accused of improper conduct with regard
to a young girl in Quebec. He was imprisoned for this on 15 Feb.1649. As
far as can be found from the records, Abraham Martin and Maire Langlois
had 9 or 10 children. Eustache, baptized 24 Oct. 1621 was the godson of
Eustache Boull&eacute;. Marguerite, born 4 Jan. 1624 and Marie 22 May 1638
to &Eacute;tienne Racine had many descendants, including the 2 bishops
Racine. H&egrave;l&eacute;ne, born 21 June 1627, was a god-child of Samuel
de Champlain. She married first Claude &Eacute;tienne in 1640 and on 3
Sep. 1647 M&eacute;dard Chouart Des Groseilliers. Marie Martin, born 1632

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Charles-Amador, born 7 March
1648, the godson of Charles de Saint-&Eacute;tienne de La Tour, was the
second Canadian-born priest. It is possible that Brother Dominque Scot,
spoken of in the Jesuit Relations as having gone to the Huron country as
a young man, was also a son. It is also possible that a young man who is
mentioned as having been in the Huron country at the same time (1634-35)
was Eustache Martin.</font></font></b>

On September 12th 1759, a young British General scaled the ramparts of
Quebec City in an attempt to capture the city from the French. At dawn
his troops lined up on the fields and awaited the attack of the french
general, Moncalm. The ensuing battle in which both generals died, was fought
on the lands that Abraham Martin once owned. To this day the battle won
by the English is known as the battle of THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Genealogist Alfred Cambray(7)
emphasizes that on 5 February 1645,(8) Robert Giffard granted a homestead
to Jean C&ocirc;t&eacute;. It measured three arpents in frontage on the
river, to the depth of the seigneury, and was located between the holdings
of Zacharie Cloutier and Noel Langlois.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>"From the time of the first settlements,"
writes Cambray, "the iroquois were relentlessly at war with the French
and with their Indian allies. The colonists were never sure of spending
a day in peace without being exposed to raids from bands of Iroquois. It
was a matter of not going far from each other in order to meet any eventuality.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>"Noel Langlois was a neighbor
of Jean C&ocirc;t&eacute; and, to ensure mutual protection, he invited
Jean to lodge near him. To this end, he gave him a small portion of land
in order to build a habitation on it. During an interlude in hostilities,
Jean C&ocirc;t&eacute; returned to the &icirc;le d'Orleans, where he had
moved his family, and left the homestead next to Langlois on which he had
done some clearing, as weil as the smail piece on which he had built a
cabin. This property was abandoned by the negligence of those supposed
to keep it up.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Jean C&ocirc;t&eacute; was the
owner of a house situated near the present corner of the rue Tr&eacute;sor

creations for the tourists. The house was on a plot of land with 150 feet
of frontage by 60 in depth. On 15 November 1649, C&ocirc;t&eacute; offered
it as dowry for his daughter Simone when she married Pierre Soumande. On
7 November 1655, Soumande sold this house to Jacques Boessel for 350 livres.
C&ocirc;t&eacute; also owned a piece of land between la Grande-All&eacute;e
and the river, in what was then the outskirts of Qu&eacute;bec. Governor
Montmagny had given it to him on 27 August 1636; this act was ratified

interred in the church, Jean C&ocirc;t&eacute;, early habitant of this
country, died the day preceding, in his house." As for Anne Martin, she
survived him by more than twenty years. The census of 1681 does not mention

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Jean Mathieu:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Life in France</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In the 17th century, life in
France was hard. There was poverty and endless war. Hard winters came with
fatal regularity. Only the nobility, military officers, merchants, and
the clergy lived comfortably, but these represented only ten percent of
the population. Jean, like most, was poor and lived in rural France. He
lived in Tapy (today spelled Tapis), a hamlet of the free town of Montignac
in the county of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe in the old French province of Angoumois
(Angoumois was renamed Departement de la Charente after the French Revolution).
Emmigration to New France offered an opportunity for many to escape these
hardships. Even in isolated rural districts, the people had learned about
New France from their parish priests. Emmigrants tended to come from rural
France.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Emmigration</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In New France, the Cardinal
de Richelieu had founded "La Compagnie des Cent-Associes" whose mandate
it was to populate New France. This organization had representatives throughout
France who were responsible for recruiting colonists. Due to their poverty,
most prospective emmigrants were unable to pay for their passage to the
New World. To solve this problem, they would arrange a contract with a
colonist, who would pay the emmigrant's passage, in return for about three
years service. The contract would normally start when the emmigrant boarded
the ship. The recruiters from "La Compagnie des Cent-Associes" served as
intermediaries. The emmigrant would usually require a bit of money to travel
to the port, and for expenses while waiting for his ship. The sponsoring
colonists would advance the emmigrant this money, but as little as possible,
since it would all be lost if the emmigrant changed his mind before embarking.
Between 1632 and 1662, about a third of the prospective colonists took
the travel money, but then failed to embark.</font></font></b>

of La Rochelle. It was scheduled to weigh anchor on Sunday 29 June, but
was delayed until Wednesday 2 July. Jean Poulet, the captain/navigator,
was well experienced and had previously made many trips to Quebec. The
Saint-Andre was a de-commissionned warship weighing 300 tons and carrying
about 130 passengers. It had just finished serving as a plague ship for
two years, and without being first quarantined or disinfected, it now carried
fare-paying passengers for the first time. The favoured route across the
Atlantic started on a south-easterly heading towards the Azores, before
turning northward. Shortly into the journey, severe fevers broke out on
board. The fevers combined with the tropical heat and shortage of drinking
water made the journey very unpleasant and deadly. After the ship turned
north and entered colder waters, the epidemic started to lose some of its
strength. In mid-August, the Saint-Andre entered the St. Lawrence River.
By early September, the ship finally approached Quebec. The ship had signalled
its plight to the colonists, who loaded some birch-bark canoes with supplies
and paddled out to meet it. The chief Jesuit, father Jean de Quen, boarded
the Saint-Andre at this time. Sadly, his charity would cost him his life.
He caught the fever and died on 8 October. On the evening of Sunday 7 September,
Captain Poulet dropped anchor. The crossing had taken 68 days and nine
passengers had died. Since it was late, the passengers did not disembark
until the next morning. Many were taken from the ship by stretcher, and
the Hotel Dieu Hospital was soon full. The fever spread to the townspeople,
and several died.</font></font></b>

at l'Ange Gardien for 90 pounds. His land was 3 arpents wide along the
St. Lawrence, and was 126 arpents deep. It was located in the Seigneurie
de Beaupre, which was bounded by the St. Lawrence river, the riviere Montmorency,
and the riviere du Gouffre.</font></font></b>

Mathieu for 5 years, after which he married and moved to Quebec.</font></font></b>

and testament with a notary. Firstly, he left 150 pounds to the poor and
the nuns so they might pray for his soul. Secondly, he left 150 pounds
to the church for the construction of the chapel. Finally, he left 300
pounds to his young godson Jean Grosleau, and 40 pounds to his servant
Jean Hue.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Louis Pinard:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Louis PINARD was born in July
1634 in the parish of Ste. Marguerite, LaRochelle, Aunis. He died in January
1695 in Bastican at the age of 60. He arrived in Canada around 1658 as
a master surgeon. The 1666 census of the Trois-Rivieres area by Talon,
lists him as a habitant and master surgeon and able to sign. His wife,
Marie-Madeleine HERTEL, was also able to sign. At the time, there was a
one-year old daughter in the household.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Louis PINARD married Canadian-born
Marie-Madeleine HERTEL in Trois-Rivieres in October 1658. He was 24 and
she was 13 years old. Although 13 at the time of her marriage, she did
not have her first child until she was 19. It was customary in New France,
at this time, to not consummate a marriage until the woman was at least
16. After her death around 1679, he remarried. His second wife was Ursule
Pepin.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Louis Pinard and Marie-Madeleine
Hertel had six children. The oldest son, Claude born in 1667 received permission
to travel west in August 1691. The west, in this case, was probably no
further than the Great Lakes. To control the fur trading and collect appropriate
taxes, the French government issued passports (permits), a form of license.
They were difficult to acquire since in many years, only 25 were issued.
To conduct fur trading or to travel west without a passport was considered
illegal and subject to punishment, most often fines or the confiscation
of furs.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Pinard's son Claude, later went
on to marry his arch rival's daughter, Francoise Gamelain. We are also
related to both these men although, in our case, the families did not come
together until a couple of generations later.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Pinard excelled in collecting
debts. Several records show his relentlessness involving collecting money
from the church, military and even nobility. Even though he may have been
tough in his business dealings, the people of Trois-Rivieres had confidence
in him. They elected him to the posts of town mayor and church warden.
After 1670, Pinard became interested in the fur trade. In 1685 he took
part in an expedition to Hudson Bay, returning home the following year.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>While it is true that Louis Pinard
was 24 years and Marie-Madeleine Hertel was 13 years at the time of their
marriage, their first child wasn't born until Marie-Madeleine was 19. It
was customary in New France that a marriage with such a young bride would
not be consummated until the wife was about 16 years old.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Louis Pinard:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Louis Pinard made his first
trip to Canada around 1648 as a "donne" of the Jesuits. At that time it
was customary for the Jesuits to be accompanied by young men on their trips
to the interior to meet with the native people. In return for the service
of these boys, the Fathers saw to their education. He returned to France
in 1650 to complete his studies. Through this first experience in Canadian
territory Louis should be numbered among the founders of the mission Ste-Marie
on the banks of Georgian Bay, what is now, Midland Ontario. He must have
known Fathers Jean de Breboeuf and Gabriel Lalemant, who were martyred
there in the spring of 1649. The constant Iroguois raids forced the French
to abandon this Huron mission, whose ruins lay forgotten for three centuries.
Recently this historic site has been restored and is today a National Park.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Louis Pinard's patrons, having
most likely discovered in him a natural talent for medicine and surgery,
had him return to France at the age of 16 or 17 in order to learn the art
of Hippocrates. Returning to Canada about 1656, young Doctor Pinard exhibited
all the competence of a master surgeon. His future bride, Marie-Madeleine
Hertel was not quite 12 years old when the marriage contract was written
up. It is probably why Louis had to wait 2 years later to be married. By
virtue of his being the surgeon of the garrison, Pinard was already in
a position to provide a comfortable living for his wife and children. In
addition he always looked out for himself even if he had to bleed some
clients white to do so. Pinard was a grasping man who did not hesitate
to appeal to justice when his interests were at stake. The civil and criminal
court records from 1660 to 1665 eloquently demonstrate this. His name is
mentioned 32 times in the Court Records of Trois-Rivieres, 1655-1662. See
General Notes Chapter. On two occasions in 1663, Pinard sued his colleague,
Dr. Michel Gemelain whose rivalry he dreaded. In spite of the cease and
desist injunction from the Sovereign Council in 1663, he did not end his
accusations.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>"Realizing that the struggle
with Louis Pinard would be endless, Gamelain, perhaps on the advice of
his mother-in-law, Madame Crevier, put his knowledge of medicine to the
service of an industry much more practical and flourishing -- the distillation
of brandy."</font></font></b>

he let another farmer, Thomas Le Sueur, work the one on l'Ile d'Orl&eacute;an.
In 1667, he owned twenty arpents in value in Beauport and on l'Ile d'Orl&eacute;an,
his farmer reported six cattle and eight arpents in value. In 1681, fourteen
years later, Paul Vachon declared to the census taker thirteen cattle and
thirty six arpents of land value. He was certainly the head of a considerable
farm.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Pierre Gagnon:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>worked at LaGaignonniere in
the parish of St-Aubin de Tourouvre, then at La Ventrouze</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Pierre never went to Quebec</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Their names were Mathurin, Jean,
Pierre and Robert GAGNON. The first three were brothers and the fourth
was their cousin. They came to New France at a time when the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>colony offered wealth only to
those who worked hard. These men started the extensive GAGNON families
which are now found in all four corners of Qu&eacute;bec, Canada and, no</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>doubt, America. They came from
Perche where their atronymic had not yet taken the form it has today. The
records, the various contracts, and the agreements, speak of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Gaignon, Gangnon, Gaignons,
Gaignon or GAGNON but GAGNON itself rarely appears. The pronunciation commonly
used on this side of the Atlantic is responsible for the name's change.
Just outside Tourouvre, in the area known as La Gaignonni&egrave;re, is
thought to be where the children of Pierre GAGNON and Magdeleine (or Ren&eacute;e)
Roger were born: arguerite,</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>in 1598; Louys, in 1604; Jean,
in 1610 and Pierre, in 1616. Vestiges of La Gaignonni&egrave;re still exist
today but, inevitably perhaps, the cradle of the family came to be known
as La Cannoni&egrave;re.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>While this family was being forgotten
in Perche, it was taking root in the soil of New France. It all starts
with Marguerite GAGNON, wife of &Eacute;loi Tavernier. The couple seems</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>to have come through the area
sometime before 1640, leading Marguerite's brothers to do the same soon
after. Over the years, Mathurin, Jean and Pierre GAGNON stick together,
the embodiment of family loyalty. Together, they settle "on the Beaupr&eacute;
shore",between Ch&acirc;teau-Richer and Sainte-Anne. In the winter, the
three men prefer to live in Qu&eacute;bec where they forget about farming
and become merchants. On August 14, 1651,still together, they acquire the
concession rights to a plot on Place de la Basse-Ville where they will
build a house. Having done quite well from agriculture and commerce, they
purchase a store a few years later, on October 6, 1658. As busy as they
are making money, the three men are already seeing to the well-being of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>their families. In Qu&eacute;bec,
on July 29, 1640, Jean marries Marguerite Cochon, originally from Dieppe,
Normandy. He was the first of the three brothers to get married. The couple</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>had eight children. However,
Jean would not have very many direct descendants. His daughters would help
perpetuate the names of the men they married: Jeanne married Jean Chapeleau,
Ren&eacute;e married Jean Houmet and Marguerite married Jean Caron.</font></font></b>

November 09, 1676; born 1660; died October 24, 1699.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Nicolas Gamache:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It is generally believed that
Nicolas Gamache arrived to News-France about 1652. Wire of Nicolas and
Jacqueline Cadot, it was accompanied by his half-brother, Jacques, and
of his half-sister, Genevieve. However, one finds no trace of the pioneer
in the censuses of 1666 and 1667. However, Jacques then cultivates a batch
in the seigniory of Bowsprit and Genevieve lives not far from there with
her husband, Julien Fortin says Bellefontaine. It is supposed that Nicolas
devoted himself to the draft of the fur skins and that it was absent from
valley of the St. Lawrence at the time of the statement of the population.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In any case, it is back in 1670,
because his/her brother-in-law concedes a ground to him. Fort says Bellefontaine
had bought a eighth of the seigniory of Bowsprit and a eighth of the island
of Orleans in 1657 and had resold these fields five years later with Mgr
Fran&ccedil;ois of Laval, but undoubtedly it had reserved a significant
real estate on the coast. Was Nicolas there too much with the narrow one?
November 3, 1672, the Talon intendant rewards his hunter. This day, it
concedes jointly in Nicolas Gamache and Louis Gagn&eacute; known as Bellavance
a ground of one half-league (42 arpents) of face on the St. Lawrence by
one mile of depth, between those of Genevieve de Chavigny, widow of the
delicatessen and tradesman Charles Amyot, and of Guillaume Fournier. New
the propi&eacute;taires will enjoy their ground set up in stronghold and
seigniory. Three years later, Gagn&eacute; receives a new concession of
ten arpents face, immediately in the west of the preceding one.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>November 8, 1676, Nicolas Gamache
signs a marriage contract in front of the notary Paul Vachon with Elisabeth-Ursule
Cloutier, girls of Charles and Louise Morin. The following day, the couple
receives the bridal blessing with the Castle-Richer. Nicolas is installed
on the field that and Gained to him received. It is besides there that
will be born his/her ten children. The five first are wire. Four of them
will found in their turn of the hearths: Louise in 1702 with Miville Angelica,
girl of Fran&ccedil;ois and Marie Langlois (12 children including 8 wire);
Nicolas in 1705 with Marie Guyon, girl of Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier and Marie
Clotus (10 children including 5 wire); Augustin in 1711 with Marguerite
Guyon, sister of the preceding one (Marie died with the birth of a first
wire just as this last), then, in 1713 with Louise Charon, girl of Pierre
and Marie Bernier (2 twins deceased the same day at the age of almost three
months and a girl).</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Then are born four girls. Elisabeth
and Anne marry two brothers, Pierre and Jean Richard, in 1709 and 1713
respectively, and give ten children to each one. In 1711, Genevieve Marie
with Joseph Hudon, but the union will be without posterity. And in 1722,
Marie is led to the furnace bridge by Louis Guyon (7 children). It is a
son who will be born in the last, Louis, who seems to have contracted two
marriages. One knows little thing of his first wife, except that it gave
him a son. One knows better his second, Genevieve B&eacute;langer, who
gave him ten children including six wire. November 1, 1689, Nicolas Gamache
and Louis Gagn&eacute; decide not to exert their right of ownership jointly
more. They divide their seigniory. Nicolas preserves the part is, broad
21 arpents.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Consequently, the concession
of Gamache will bear its name or will be indicated like the seigniory of
Ilette, and that of Gained, in addition to carrying its patronym, will
receive the name of Fresnaye; the owner became one Gained known as Bellavance
and sior of Fresnaye. October 23, 1699, Nicolas Gamache lost his wife.
A few days later, it died in its turn. It had not been forgotten that the
couple had liberally yielded the ground necessary to the first church of
the Cape-Saint-Ignace: October 29, 1728, one carried out the translation
of the remainders of these pioneers from the old church in the news. C.est
the elder one of wire, Louis, who had become lord of Ilette to the death
of his father. In 1744, the church being "ready to fall to the sea", it
gives a ground to set up a news of it, in the condition y of having its
bench seigneurial. One will set up a comfortable presbytery which will
be also used for the worship while waiting for construction of the new
parochial temple, but this one, on decision of the bishop, Mgr de Pontbriand,
will be rather established in the Handle-with-Gilles. He resulted from
it, written Mr. Philippe P&acirc;quet, who carried out research on the
Gamache family, of the interminable quarrels.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It is undoubtedly for that,
notices it, that the Dolbec priest left the parish of the Cape-Saint-Ignace
to become the first priest of Islet which it had served for four years.
But the Gamache manor survived so far these quarrels and it was classified
historic building in 1955. Between 1978 and 1985, it underwent significant
work of restoration. One can see the old back frontage of this worthy house
by precisely borrowing the street of the Manor-Gamache, in the Cape-Saint-Ignace.
It is one of the most beautiful buildings of the locality, with its bored
sloping roof of attic windows and its hardcore walls bound by a mortar
which defies centuries.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Nicolas Gamache was originating
in a small borough become the commune of Saint-Illiers-la-Ville. If from
Paris one borrows N 13 towards Rouen, one reaches Mantes-the-Pretty (to
approximately 25 km in the west of Saint-Germain-en-Laye), then the Rosny-on-Seine
(8 km). Here small D 114 begins which passes under motorway 13: Saint-Illiers
is only to 9 km, south-western direction.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>And the descendants of the Nicolas
ancestor will be very happy to find there a small panel road indicating
the situation of the hamlet of Gamacherie, just as a pleasant property
of countryside, Large Gamacherie. One is at home!</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The first Doucet to come to
Acadia and the ancestor of all persons bearing that name in Acadia, was
Germain Sieur de La Verdure, and he was later known in the history of Port
Royal as La Verdure.&nbsp; He came from the parish of Couperans in Brie,
France.&nbsp; He arrived in Acadia at La Heve on September 8, 1632 with
Governor Isaac de Razilly.&nbsp; Germain Doucet was a trusted friend of
Charles de Menou de Charnisay, Sieur d'Aulnay, who was a cousin of Razilly,
and on Razilly's death, d'Aulnay became Lieutenant General of Acadia in
1638.&nbsp; Germain Doucet brought with him from France, his wife (whose
maiden name was Bourgeois because Germain mentioned that&nbsp; Jacques
Bourgeois was his brother-in-law) and his two children, Pierre, born in
1621 and Marguerite born in 1630.&nbsp; Marguerite later married Abraham
Dugas.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Germain Doucet, dit La Verdure,
was a military captain who came to Acadia with a troop of recruits, which
included Jacques Bourgeois, military surgeon, and Abraham Dugas, armourer.&nbsp;
Doucet's&nbsp;&nbsp; name is first mentioned in the Acadian registry on
July 14, 1640, with the title "Arms Captain of&nbsp; Pentagoet", when he
brought charges against La Tour, the rival in Acadia of Governor d'Aulnay.&nbsp;
Doucet was a trusted friend of Governor d'Aulnay and was in the Governor's
last will and testament written January 20, 1649 at Port Royal.&nbsp; He
speaks of Germain Doucet, dit La Verdure of the parish of Couperans in
Brie, prays for La Verdure and his wife and specifically mentions a bequest
to La Verdure and his wife of "50 ecus" per annum to be paid during their
lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Governor died suddenly on May 24, 1650 when his
canoe capsized in Port Royal basin.&nbsp; He left a wife and eight young
children.&nbsp; In Acadia, the administration of the estate was finally
awarded jointly to d'Aulnay's widow and Germain Doucet dit La Verdure who
became overseer of the children's guardian.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The widow of d'Aulnay remarried
at Port Royal on February 24, 1653 to La Tour and their marriage contract
was signed by La Verdure and his brother-in-law Bourgeois.&nbsp; The La
Tours went to live at his St. John River Fort leaving Port Royal in charge
of Germain Doucet as military captain on behalf of d'Aulnay's minor children
who were living at Port Royal.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In France, Emmanuel Le Borgne,
a La Rochelle merchant, obtained a court judgement against the estate of
d'Aulnay and he came to Acadia in 1653 to take possession.&nbsp; He set
himself up at Port Royal as "Seigneur" (Lord), and soon decided to seize
all of Acadia.&nbsp; He was making plans to attack La Tour at St. John
when the English from Boston attacked Port Royal.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In August 1654, when Colonel
Robert Sedgwick attacked Port Royal with six hundred Bostonians, Germain
Doucet was Military Commandent of Port Royal under Le Borgne, who had come
from France to take possession of d'Aulnay's estate.&nbsp; Le Borgne sent
out a small detachment under a sergeant to fight about three hundred English
who had landed to attack the fort.&nbsp; When the sergeant was killed,
the troops returned to the fort.&nbsp; Le Borgne, who was a La Rochelle
merchant, not a colonist or soldier, decided to capitulate the town and
the fort, hoping to save himself and his ship, the Chateauford, as he claimed
to be merely a private citizen and merchant.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The capitulation was negotiated
by Germain Doucet in his capacity as Commanding Officer and as deputy guardian
of minor children of d'Aulnay.&nbsp; Sedgwick restored nothing to Le Borgne,
but La Verdure obtained honorable terms for his soldiers and transportation
for them to France.&nbsp; He also received favorable consideration for
the children of d'Aulnay, who had much property at Port Royal. The inhabitants
were permitted to remain, with liberty of conscience, and to enjoy their
property or to sell it and return to France.&nbsp; The missionary priests
were also permitted to remain,&nbsp; if they chose, provided they lived
two or three leagues from the fort.&nbsp; Most of the inhabitants remained
in Acadia, but the military and civil officials in accordance with the
terms of the capitulation of Port Royal returned to France in 1654.&nbsp;

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Came to New France with Samuel
de Champlain in 1613. It was a common</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>practice for Champlain to put
young boys into the native tribes for a year</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>or two to learn the language
and customs so they could be his interpreters</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>as young men, and that is what
happened to Jacques. He was an interpreter</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>until 1629 when New France fell
to the Kirk brothers. Then he and the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>other interpreters fled to their
tribes of their youth, where they lived</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>till 1633 when Champlain was
back and New France returned to the French.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>In 1633 Jacques was granted
land at Trois-Rivieres, PQ, Canada and was the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>first settler there. He married
a French girl in 1641 and had 3 children</font></font></b>

enough to be given the title interpreter.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>(not sure what interpetation

<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>For the purpose of our intent

NOTES FOR HIS FATHER DEBUNKING)</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>of Ots-Toch, born from a liason
with a Mohawk woman in New York, we must find evidence that Jacques had
opportunity to interact with the Iroquois tribes in the critical time period
of 1615-1627. It is during this time that Ots-Toch was born, and although
the majority of reports put her birth at 1620, we can not be sure this
is correct.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It is also necessary to understand
the relationships of the Indian tribes</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>when Champlain made his first
expedition against the Iroquois in 1609. In</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>1535 Jacques Cartier visited
the St. Lawrence and found the northern shore</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>occupied by the Montagnais Indians,
almost up to the narrows of Quebec.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>From there to the Ottawa the
Algonquins, conquerors of the Montagnais,</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>lived. Beyond the Ottawa and
still bordering the St. Lawrence, were the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Hurons, who were allies of the
Algonquins in their war with the Iroquois.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The Iroquois nation, to which
the Huron belonged although they were now at</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>war, occupied the territory
south of the St. Lawrence and south-east of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Lake Ontario. The St. Lawrence,
as the dividing line, was frequently the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>scene of battle between marauding
parties of Indians. As Iroquois power</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>grew in the 16th. century, the
Hurons retreated to the peninsula between</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Georgian Bay and Lake Huron,
while the Algonquins retired to the upper</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Ottawa through the chain of
lakes connecting the Ottawa River with</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Georgian Bay. Until the mid
17th. century, this was the only route used</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>for going to and from Huron
country to Quebec. [Biggar: pp 70-71]</font></font></b>

all the tribes visted by Champlain in the</font></font></b>

came down to the St. Lawrence for the first</font></font></b>

of any trading connections in that</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>direction" [p.106]</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>There is a chapter on the Fur
Trade and it states that the hunting tribes</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>were those furthest from the
centres of trade at Montreal, Trois-Rivieres,</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Quebec and Tadoussac. They trade
their furs to other Indians, not the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>French. The Indians "in the
middle" dealt with both French and other</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Indians. The Iroquois dealt
with the Dutch settlers at Fort Orange, NY.</font></font></b>

not really extensive until the founding of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Fort Orange in 1624. So, we
are on the very beginning edge of European contact with the Indians. In
1626, the Dutch almost lost their toe-hold on the Hudson</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>when the commander of Fort Orange
sided with the Mahicans against their</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Mohawk enemies. The Mahicans
were badly defeated and only some fancy</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>negotiating by the new director
of the colony, Peter Minuit, managed to</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>salvage the situation and forge
a friendship with the Mohawks. Even then,</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Minuit withdrew all of the settlers
to the recently purchased Manhattan</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Island for their safety.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>We know that it was not long
before the French were beginning to expand</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>their contacts with the NY Indians.
It seems that they concentrated their</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>efforts in the area around Oneida
Lake. Their trading did begin to worry the</font></font></b>

to conclude a peace, to return with these</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Iroquois. On their arrival in
the Iroquois country they were met with a</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>good reception and a permanent
treaty was drawn up. Thirty-five canoes of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Iroquois had now arrived both
to trade and to sign the peace. Although the</font></font></b>

very various no difficulty arose, so perfect</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>were the arrangements made by
Champlain. Each nation had its own interpreter. After the ordinary business
of the barter, there ws the feast of frinedship with presents given by
both sides. Then followed the dances and other festivities. Finally the
whole was brought to a close by the conclusion of the long-hoped-for peace
between the iroquois, the Hurons and the French." [pp123,124]</font></font></b>

<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>&nbsp; ii. Francois Hertel,
born 1642.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Notes for Francois Hertel:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Fran&ccedil;ois' father&nbsp;
was to die from an accident when Fran&ccedil;ois was but a boy of nine.
Left behind, in addition, to this nine year old, was his mother and two
infant sisters: Fran&ccedil;ois, therefore, was to learn responsibility
and hard work early in his life. These were the times of the Iroquois raids
which just about wiped out the French colonies at Quebec in the early years.2
As but yet a young boy, he felled trees and farmed with a musket always
at the ready nearby. Because of these regular Iroquois attacks Fran&ccedil;ois
Hertel was to be "schooled from his youth to believe that danger was always
present, and must be conquered by toughness." In 1661, the nineteen year
old was captured by a band of roving Iroquois. Fran&ccedil;ois Hertel was
brought back to Iroquois country (the Finger Lakes district of New York,
as named these days) there to be used as the object of some entertainment
until an elderly Iroquois woman claimed the young man as her own. For two
years he was to live among the Iroquois and learned their ways and their
language. He eventually escaped and returned to his family in Quebec, who,
I shouldn't have to say, were amazed to find him alive and well. He settled
back into farming his lands at Trois-Rivi&egrave;res; content to get himself
married (1664) and to start raising a family of his own (there were to
be at least seven sons). The colony was soon to put such a valuable person
to work (we might imagine his reluctance as he rubbed his burn scars inflicted
on him by the Iroquois). In 1673, Fran&ccedil;ois was to accompany Frontenac
inland, to Lake Ontario, there to take part in the building of Fort Frontenac
(Kingston). In 1690, Frontenac was to send out Indian war parties led by
French officers, sent to terrorize the English. The Hertels, learning much
from their Indian allies, were to perfect their surprize tactics which
were very effective: the blood of innocent English settlers along the western
and northern borders of New England was to flow. After traveling weeks
on end and traversing hundreds of miles of wilderness which led them over
the highlands of the Appalachians in the winter months, over frozen lakes
and down frozen rivers, they would arrive at some little New England village,
and wait until night fall: then the screams would go up and the hacking
would start, catching the wintering settlers completely off guard. Many
of these attacks were led by Hertel and his sons. History has come to call
them "Hertel's Raids." "The Hertels, father and sons, rapidly became the
terror of the English and the enemy Indians. Their feats were beyond number.
They turned up everywhere."3</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Thus, the frontier-wise Fran&ccedil;ois
Hertel was to train his sons. Fran&ccedil;ois also saw to the academic
education of his sons: "he entrusted this task to the teacher Pierre Bertrand,
who had already studied at the University of Paris." The Hertel boys, we
might imagine, came to know how to deal with all levels of society.</font></font></b>

French-Canadians. This historical episode hit the imagination of many younsters
on school benches, and we never forgot it. But there is a premilinary to

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>Bostonians were trying to invade
Canada by the golf. The parish priest of Rivi&egrave;re-Ouelle having found
out that a considerable flotilla of American boats was coming up the St-Lawrence
in the desire to take over the colony, gathered all his parishioners and
exhorted them to prevent with all their strength the landing that the Bostonians
might try at Rivi&egrave;re-Ouelle. Mr De la Bouteillerie, Seigneury of
Rivi&egrave;re-Ouelle, was then in Qu&eacute;bec; The residents then asked
their parish priest himself to direct them in combat if the occasion came
about. Mr De Francheville accepted without objection. Soon the flotilla
laid anchor in front of the point. Many launches were seen leaving the
boats and rowing towards shore.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>It is then that the residents
of the parish, under the direction of their parish priest, came to place
themselves in ambush at the edge of the forest under cover from the view
from the shore. There, they waited silently the arrival of the launches
that were approaching rapidly. Since it was high tide, the launches loaded
with soldiers could come very close to them within range of their guns.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>The order to land was given and
took place without suspicion that they were watched by Canadian gunmen.
In such a moment of confusion, that is normal in a landing, and while the
soldiers were taking their arms, a yell FIRE was suddenly heard at the
forest edge from abby De Francheville. At the same time many detonations
took place and a hailstorm of bullets reached the miserable Bostonians.
The panic was general ! Those not hit by bullets ran for their launches
and their boats without hearing the voices of the officers trying to bring
them back into combat.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=-1>This defeat was the prelude to
