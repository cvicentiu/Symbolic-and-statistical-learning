&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Marianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose together
in August. It took us four days. Mike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead of
us and it took them 5 days. When one is on a big wall for four days one has to
haul a lot of items up, water, food, sleeping bags etc. and thus the haul bag
can weigh over 40 kg. This slows one's climbing down considerably because the
haulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance.&nbsp;<o:p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">When Hans said to me that he had a free day to go
climbing, I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans to
climb it in a day. As Hans had climbed the route 31 times before (he holds the
record for most Nose ascents), he knew the exact rack of gear needed. The rack
consisted of double caming devices from 00 to two inch and one each of three and
four inch. A couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken, mainly micro nuts.
One 60 m rope, two ascenders and some aiders. 4 liters of water, some Power bars
and peanuts. &nbsp;</span></p>

started the climb at 06h50am. As I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches on
my earlier ascent, Hans led to Sickle Ledge. I took the lead from there, and led
up the Stovelegs (these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened the
route in 1958 when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove as
protection). Hans simul-climbed below me. We passed one party of two climbers
who happily let us by. Hans lead the last Stovelegs pitch up to Dolt Tower with
me jugging on the line he fixed. It is quicker if the leader gets to a stance,
fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch. We reached Dolt
Tower in just over two hours which, on the previous trip had&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

up the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne, we decided on doing the
Jardine Traverse, a slight variation to the route. Three more pitches and we
were at camp four, the half way mark on the route. We sat for a couple of

I led the Great Roof which took me 28 minutes to lead and 7 minutes for Hans to
clean it, thus taking 35 min for that pitch. I was leading using Hans' super
light aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear, one of the straps on the
aiders snapped, letting me drop about 20 cm before it caught me again, thus
sending some adrenaline through my system. This pitch has only been free climbed
by Lynn Hill and Scott Burke. IT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT!!!!!<o:p>

Pancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a super
lay back crack. Free climbing this pitch at about grade 19/20 is exhilarating

<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#660033"><font size="5"><span style="font-family: Arial">History</span></font><!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>A typical ascent of the Nose, which takes the average speed climber between 
12 and 15 hours. The first ascent of the Nose, in 1957 and '58: Warren Harding, 
a bon vivant from Northern California, spent 45 days over 18 months literally 
carving his route by drilling some 200 expansion bolts into the sheer granite 
face, infuriating environmentalists but fascinating just about everyone else. 
Through newspapers and radio the entire nation followed intently as Harding and 
his team of two other climbers established four campsites on ledges along the 
way, all of the sites linked by 1,200 feet of rope secured by nearly 700 pitons. 
Hundreds of pounds of supplies were winched up by a clumsy device called the 
Dolt Cart -- a pull cart with two bicycle wheels. The circuslike sight caused 
traffic jams on the main road below, which at one point prompted a ranger to 
yell at Harding through a bullhorn, &quot;Get your ass down from there!&quot; In October 
1958 a ranger demanded that Harding complete the climb by Thanksgiving or 
abandon it. Finally, on Nov. 12, after a continuous 12-day push, Harding 
staggered over the rim of the Nose. </p>
<p>&quot;It was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was conquered,&quot; 
Harding would say a year later. &quot;I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in much 
better condition than I was.&quot; </p>
<p>So began the popularity of big-wall climbing in the U.S., with Yosemite as 
the sport's epicenter and Harding as the free-spirited forefather. In late 
February, Harding died of liver failure at age 77, and as night fell on the 
Yosemite Valley on May 25, some 400 climbers gathered in a granite quarry behind 
an abandoned gas station in Bishop, Calif., to celebrate his life. The diverse 
group included erstwhile rock stars such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard, 
aging Vulgarians -- members of the famously hedonistic sect of climbers who have 
been part of the Yosemite scene since the '60s -- and big-wall vagabonds who had 
hitched hundreds of miles. Some recalled Harding's infamous drinking binges 
while others told salacious tales of his womanizing. At the end of each of his 
first ascents, for example, a bottle of champagne and a beautiful woman (who had 
been ferried up a much simpler route) would be waiting. Though his skills didn't 
match those of his contemporaries Robbins and Chouinard, Harding didn't care to 
work hard enough to improve. &quot;Screwing is more enjoyable than drilling bolt 
holes,&quot; he liked to say. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, says veteran Yosemite climber Mike Corbett, &quot;People were just 
drawn to him, and no one's been able to match him. He was so full of life.&quot; </p>
<p>So, too, was the Yosemite Valley. While beachboys on longboards were 
proliferating along the Southern California coast in the early '60s, Harding's 
antiestablishment band of climbers -- including boozers, dopers and drifters -- 
was making merry some 280 miles to the northeast. After descending upon Camp 4, 
the venerated four-acre dirt patch just east of El Cap, the climbers provoked 
park rangers by mooning tourists and stealing campers' food. They held raucous 
parties long past midnight. They were incorrigibly loud, except when authorities 
asked them about matters like the whereabouts of 240 40-pound bales of pot that 
disappeared from a smuggler's plane that crashed in the Valley in February 1977.
</p>
<p>For all their hedonism, these wall rats were also supremely gifted athletes 
and left no rock unscaled in the valley. By the early 1970s every meaningful 
big-wall route in Yosemite had been established, and climbers turned to setting 
speed records. By the mid-'70s advances in climbing technique and gear had 
enabled climbers to reach the peak of the Nose in less than 24 hours. During an 
unprecedented 15-hour climb in 1975, Jim Bridwell, John Long and Billy Westbay 
ditched their haul bags and carried a mere 11Ú2 gallons of water -- not to 
mention two packs of Camel straights, which they lit up while on each of the 
route's 34 pitches. &quot;We thought we were so studly,&quot; Bridwell says. &quot;We didn't 
think about trying to set another record, because the whole point was just to 
break 24 hours. These guys are a new breed. What they're doing is phenomenal.&quot;
</p>
<p>The first of this new breed, which arrived in the Yosemite Valley in the 
early 1980s, included Peter Croft and Dave Schultz, speed-climbing pioneers who 
employed riskier techniques such as simul-climbing, in which two roped-up 
climbers ascend together. Croft and Schultz, soon joined by Florine, turned the 
Nose into the autobahn, completing ascents in nine hours and 15 minutes, then 
8:02, then 6:40. When Croft and a partner went sub-five in 1991, Florine 
inquired about teaming with him to try to set a new record. Croft agreed, and in 
June 1992 the duo took the wall in 4:22. &quot;Everyone thought what they did was 
mind-blowing,&quot; O'Neill says. &quot;I thought that record would never be broken.&quot; </p>

Friends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows, looking up at climbers on El
Cap, when we spotted someone on this blank headwall. That had to be the Shield,
it looked so exposed. We were amazed that a climb even went up this piece of
rock. During the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the route
and they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space and
exposure.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">When
Mike, Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley, I needed something to climb and
so the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head. I had never soloed a big
wall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">When
I was learning to rope solo, I had practiced on the first ten pitches of the
Shield to Mammoth Ledges (same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe).
From here there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground. When I was ready
for the route, I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for 5 days. I
managed two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I set
up the porta ledge and was comfy asleep, when it started raining. So in the dark
and rain I had to re-setup the porta ledge with the fly, which was brand new and
had not been seam sealed. It kept raining until about 8 in the morning. The wind
was blowing the whole ledge around. I was not far from this little gully, which
the rain turned into a river. This all made for an unpleasant adventure. Most of
the things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm to
continue, retreat was still possible as I was not to high, so I fixed some lines
and abseiled all the way down to the ground, leaving the gear at my high point.
Spent the weekend re-motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun, as it was
Halloween.</span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Monday,
I jugged back up the lines, climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge below
a big roof. There were three American climbers on a route called Flight of
the Albatross, which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty to
forty meters to the left. Therefore I had some company as we shouted across to
each other every now and then. In the morning I lead the roof pitch, which
brought me straight onto the headwall. The exposure started to kick in..in
a big way. The Shield headwall starts about 500m up, is blank, slightly bulging,
slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack/seam running up it. In
many places copper heads and rurps (baby pitons) are the only things that will
fit. There were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any
(which was good because I only had two spare copperheads anyway). I did not clip
the copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be ripped
out, and I would be unable to put in more. This caused me to lead out several
times. This was the case when I was nearing the bolts, but I could just not
reach them. There was some old sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aiders
into that and stood in them. I was about to clip into the bolt direct when I
heard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the air
upside down. It was amazing how fast I thought about: the last placement I had
clipped; if it would hold; how far was I going to fall. Thank goodness this old
fixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meters
lower than I was a few seconds earlier. Thank goodness this rope soloing
technique works!!!!!!</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

managed to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this time
and then set up camp. To the left and right and up and down there was just blank
rock with only this three or four millimetre wide crack/seam leading the way.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">

pitches a day is about the going rate for A3 or harder when soloing, and

to the toilet can be an interesting affair. The rules are, climbers must carry a
porta potty. So, one has to do ones business into a brown paper bag and then
put this into the porta potty, which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVC
pipe with lids. Aiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge, as
soiling the ledge would not be fun, as this is the kitchen, the bed and the
bathroom.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> <o:p>

managed to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped.
The one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lots
of the gear I had placed. When I finally came to a halt, all the popped gear
slid down the rope towards me, in this instance about 6 pieces of gear. I then
went back up, hammering in those pitons, which I had been slightly reluctant to
do, as getting pitons out is more work.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

the head wall, ledges start appearing which makes biving/sleeping much easier.
The penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney. The only
problem I had was on the last pitch when I was hauling the last two pitches in
one. The fifi hook which was holding the haulbag in place would not release from
the bolt, so I had to abseil back down over the roof. hanging in mid air a
1000m up, then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag to then jumar
