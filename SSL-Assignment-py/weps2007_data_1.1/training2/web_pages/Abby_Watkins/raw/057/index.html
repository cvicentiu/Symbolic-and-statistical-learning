<span class="137595121-14112003"><font face="Arial">Mentors are needed for the
<b>Fourth Annual Student Biotech Expo </b>(</font><a href="http://www.studentbiotech.org"><font face="Arial">www.studentbiotech.org</font></a><font face="Arial">)! 
The Student Biotech Expo is hosted by the Washington Biotechnology Foundation (WBF), 
a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the understanding of 
biotechnology through education. The 2004 Expo will be held March 18th at 
Meydenbauer Center, Bellevue. The Student Biotech Expo draws together high 
school students from thirteen Seattle-area biology, biotechnology and molecular 
biology classes and allows them to present their work to each other and to the 
public. The Expo promotes science literacy and allows students to showcase work 
that reflects different aspects of biotechnology and biomedicine. Two key 
elements of the Expo distinguish it from conventional science fairs. First, each 
student is matched with a community mentor who has experience in the student's 
area of interest. This program facilitates connections between the scientific 
and education communities and provide increased opportunities for student access 
to resources. Second, students projects can be presented in a variety of forms - 
from art, drama, or music to molecular modeling, web design or traditional 
scientific research. For all projects, students must research the science behind 
their chosen topics. Students have the opportunity to see the relevance of 
science to their own interests, and can demonstrate their learning in ways that 
best suit them.</font><p><i><font face="Arial">Mentors are invaluable assets to 
students. The role of the mentor is to serve as a reference to the student for 
their project. Time Commitment varies from 2 - 20 or more hours depending on 
type of contact. We work with mentors to accommodate their availability! 
Mentorships can range from email contact to internships. Mentors who sign up 
within the next few weeks will have the opportunity to attend one of the 
mentor/student get-together at a host research facility.</font></i></p>
