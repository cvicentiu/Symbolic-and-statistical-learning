            has not caught on in the far reaches of Western Australia. A simple 
            roadsign, the only break in an endless horizon, indicated we had crossed 
            the Tropic of Capricorn for the second time. The coastal region directly 
            below the tropics is unique in that it doesn't experience the dual 
            seasons of the wet and the dry. The climate is close to ideal and 
            the city of Carnarvon makes the most of a year-round growing season 
            with luxuriant plantations that provide all the ingredients for bowls 
            of fruit salad. The wide streets were lined with dazzling displays 
            of poincettas, bougainvilleas and hibiscus and we saw green lawns 
            again thanks to the plentiful supply of water provided by the Gascoyne 
            River. We made the most of the opportunity to sample the fresh fish 
            and prawns that provide another thriving industry to the region.</font></p>

        <td colspan="3"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I reached 
          the Overlander Roadhouse hot, tired and dry after 100 km of crosswinds 
          to be met by a sign that warned, "Do not ask for water as refusal may 
          offend". We avoided the prospect of being offended by having an ample 
          supply of Carnarvon water and enough time in the day to ride another 
          35 kms before finding a place to pull off the highway to camp for the 
          night. We had surprise visitors in the morning when two emus walked 
          into camp, at first oblivious to our presence, but then dancing off 
          in their strange swaying, bobbing, wingless gait as they became aware 
          of us. It was a busy morning as their vacated spots were filled by a 
          herd of wild goats. We were to see large numbers of feral goats and 
          sheep in the next few days until reaching the Murchison Boundary fence 
          that stretches for 1700 km across Western Australia providing a barrier 
          to stop them munching on the greening vegetation that met us as we headed 
          south. </font></td>

          are a major reason people travel to Western Australia in the spring. 
          The more we followed the compass south, the more colourful and prolific 
          the roadside displays of wildflowers became. The isolation of Western 
          Australia is a factor in the uniqueness and variety of the species to 
          be found here, numbering up to 12,000. Approaching Kalbarri National 
          Park the road was lined with the silvertipped branches of the smokebush 
          and yellow flowering wattle with clusters of red banksias, grevilleas, 
          kangaroo paws and patches of everlastings in carpets of brilliant pink, 
          yellow and purple. It was a spectacular showcase that slowed our progress 
          as June insisted on identifying each new species she saw. At a roadside 
          reststop I caught up to June who introduced me to a fellow wanderer, 
          Mary Ebbott. Mary's daughter, Abby Watkins lives in Golden and along 
          with Rick Marshall spends much of her time in the mountains climbing 
          and exploring. We look forward to making a connection with them upon 
          our return. </font></td>

          is one of those jewels on a traveller's roadmap that makes you want 
          to hang around for a while longer. Surrounded on one side by heathlands 
          of exquisite wildflowers and on another by the deep red-rock gorges 
          of the Murchison River and yet on another side by an ocean that has 
          carved a jagged coastline of red-banded cliffs, Kalbarri has managed 
          to retain a low profile village atmosphere that provides a sheltered 
          harbour from the storms of the world. It may not have appeared so idyllic 
          for the first settlers in the area. Back in 1629 two mutinous crew members 
          from the Dutch East India trading ship, the Batavia were put ashore 
          here, giving them the distinction of being the first European settlers, 
          albeit unwillingly, in this country yet to be discovered by Captain 
          Cook.</font></td>

            thereafter hit a reef and sank as did numerous other early visiting 
            ships to the region. The constant pounding of the Indian Ocean surf 
            has claimed massive chunks of red sandstone and white limestone from 
            the towering cliffs, continuously moulding the landscape into caves, 
            natural bridges and rugged coastal gorges. One of the trips most memorable 
            meals was eaten at Finlay's B.B.Q. in Kalbarri, Aussie style, cooked 
            in a tin shed and eaten outside under the stars on a sand floor sitting 
            around a campfire. The pile of seafood and salad was staggering and 
            entertainment was provided by anyone who wanted to get up and play 
            an instrument or sing. Need a napkin?, grab a toilet roll and drinking 
            water came in wine bottles. You couldn't complain about the service 
            in this restaurant, there wasn't any. If you didn't serve yourself 
            you went without.</font></p>

          thought we had taken a wrong turn out of Kalbarri and had somehow ended 
          up in England. The countryside quite suddenly became rolling green farmland 
          in total contrast to the scenery of the past 3 months. Northampton was 
          a stopover where we visited the local school. Set in rolling hills dotted 
          with sheep and smothered in purple wildflowers, it is an agricultural 
          village with a population of 800 and quaint sandstone block buildings. 
          Teacher Ann Williams arranged for us to give a presentation to a large 
          group of students ranging in age from grades 1 to 7. They were a very 
          attentive and well-behaved group of students and it was most rewarding 
          to visit a school that my former students had been emailing from Kimberley.

            the haphazard growth of squatter's shacks along the remote beaches.

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The southern beaches 
            have the whitest sand we had ever seen, due to a high concentration 
            of lime in the region. It is also one of the richest areas for plant 
            species in the world with the heathlands boasting more than 900 recorded 
            species, more than all the native plants recorded for Great Britain. 
            It is difficult to fathom since the sandy soils are extremely low 
            in nutrients and don't hold moisture well but the plant life has adapted 
            to this adversity and evolved in amazing numbers. We discovered an 
            interesting desert landscape when we visited the Pinnacles Desert 
            near Cervantes. Huge limestone pillars rise out of the surrounding 
            desert sands resembling ancient tombstones. The early Dutch explorers 
            seeing them from offshore thought were seeing the remains of an ancient 
            city.</font></p>

            of the Sydney Olympic Games. It certainly was a spectacular opening 
            and the first few days of competition indicate that this Olympics 
            will be a very successful event. </font></p>
