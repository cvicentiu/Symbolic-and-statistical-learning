1. Jon Healey, Revelstoke Community Foundation<br>
<br>
Mr. Healey introduced Ashley Rohde, Chair of the Youth Committee and Debby 
Robinson, Director of the Foundation.<br>
<br>
Mr. Healey informed Council of the difference between a Foundation and other 
Charities. A Foundation invests contributions and distributes grants from the 
income generated. The principal funds are kept in perpetuity. Most charities 
however, are required by law to disperse their funds in the year that 
contributions are received. Mr. Healey advised that the Revelstoke Community 
Foundation has been in existence for 3 years and the endowment fund is up to 
almost $600,000. Last year the Foundation gave out grants totaling $23,000 for 
projects in the community.<br>
<br>
Mr. Healey reported that the Foundation has taken over managing a number of 
scholarships in the community totaling approximately $100,000. The Credit Union 
has also put $50,000 into a special fund for grants for youth projects. Another 
initiative is a Youth and Philanthropy Program. Mr. Healey then asked Miss Rohde 
to update Council.<br>
<br>
Miss Rohde informed Council that the Youth Branch of Community Foundation 
started up about 1½ years ago and that they call themselves “YPLAY” Young 
Philanthropists Linking all Youth. To date they have built up over $10,000 in 
endowment funds and hope to be issuing grants late spring and early summer. The 
group is also currently working on a needs assessment for youth in Revelstoke.<br>
<br>
In closing Mr. Healey thanked the City for being a sponsor of the Revelstoke 
Community Foundation.<br>
<br>
Mayor McKee thanked Mr. Healey, Ms. Robinson and Miss Rohde for attending the
