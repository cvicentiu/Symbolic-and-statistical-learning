   A Report by Eliza Moran, AAC Director</B></FONT></P>

   report originally appearing in the American Alpine Club, Sierra
   Nevada Section Newsletter (July/August 1998 ) is reprinted with

   British Mountaineering Council sponsored a first in the world, a
   symposium dedicated to and for woman climbers. The idea was to
   bring together women climbers of all abilities, to explore issues
   facing them and to enjoy climbing in one of the UK's premier
   venues, North Wales.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Twenty-six countries responded by
   sending 80 women ranging in age from 15 to 68 years. Every aspect
   of this sport was represented in the diversity of women
   sent--mountaineers, ice climbers, traditional rock climbers,
   boulderers, sport climbers, professionals and amateurs. What came
   out of this meeting? As the group first came together, it was
   quite apparent that we judged each other by nationalities.
   Interaction began in English, no matter the country of origin. The
   official welcomes and written agenda presented by our hosts did
   not really hint at what would transpire during the week. I don't
   think that most of the invited guests really knew just what we
   were going to do either, but like all grand adventures, it begins
   with the first step. Over meals, out climbing, in lectures, and
   while shopping for climbing equipment that was generously offered
   at discount rates by local manufacturers and stores, we came to
   discover who we were. National labels fell by the wayside as we
   found no stereotypes in looks or styles. No elitism or competition
   manifested itself as a form of segregation during our climbing
   days. Educational levels ranked highly, with a strong
   representation in the sciences and medicine.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Climbing--was it a hobby, a sport,
   a job, a form of competition, or a way of life? This theme soon
   emerged as new personalities came to the front daily, expressing
   viewpoints that were encouraged by our British women climber
   hosts. Why do we stay in climbing? Here the answers became as
   varied and intriguing as one might expect. Who encouraged you? Who
   supports you? Why were you sent to represent your Federation at
   this symposium? Was it a man who selected you? What do you think
   that you will take back with you to your Federation from this
   symposium? Again, another theme became apparent as we all saw the
   similarities of our predicaments as woman athletes trying to
   validate our desire to climb.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One of the BMC's guest speakers on
   media night lecture (in addition to our AAC President, Alison
   Osius) was author and pathologist Dr. Rosemary Cohen. She
   presented a small chronology of books and articles written about
   women climbers. Of note was an article written in 1838, entitled
   <EM>Thwarted Maiden Lady</EM>. This defined the woman climber as a
   spinster who could not find or get a man to marry her. Universal
   laughter filled the room as this was translated (not an easy task
   to translate <EM>thwarted</EM>) into 26 languages. However, in
   this laughter was a recognition amongst us of the the shadow
   question that still exists today for all women. You must be
   climbing because your real life as a woman is not complete, i.e.,
   no man to marry. Something must be missing that is causing you to
   do this, otherwise a happy woman would not be climbing. Why do you
   want to take that risk and if you do now that you are having
   children, you wouldn't do that anymore would you? Every woman in
   the room had faced some format of this question sometime in her
   life. When we heard of the lonely efforts of the woman climbers in
   Iran, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, we knew that we were not so far
   removed from this ourselves. Francoise Aubert, UIAGM French Guide
   that makes her living guiding, revealed to us that her new ice
   route topping out on Point Helen was not recognized by her French
   Climbing Federation. As of yet, this ice climb has not been
   repeated. In solidarity we realized we are not so far removed from
   the stigma of the Thwarted Maiden Lady.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many wonderful exchanges continued
   that were as novel as the speakers. Backgrounds as exotic as the
   countries represented and adventures came to the front as we
   discovered who we were: oceanographers, physicists, physicians,
   teachers, biologists, flight attendants, North Sea oil riggers,
   physical therapists, students, grandmothers, tour operators,
   public relations directors. We were problem solvers. We too came
   to ask ourselves the question, "Why do you climb?" As to the
   diversity of answers supplied, I will leave that to you the reader
   to surmise. I came away from this meeting fatigued. I did not want
   to miss out on anything. This meeting enabled me as an AAC
   Director to ask for a statement of support for our club's position
   with the Friends of Valley in our lawsuit against the National
   Park Service. After a day of intense discussion with all
   delegates, I was proud to see this group give the AAC a unanimous
   vote of support. You can see this statement on </FONT><A HREF="http://www.camp4yosemite.com"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The
   Friends of Yosemite Valley</B></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
   web site.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the image of the woman
   climber? She is anything and everything, she is always the same
   and she is never the same. She can make a difference and will if
   given the chance. Whatever you may think, I believe it is safe to
   say we don't see ourselves as "Thwarted Fair Maidens". We see
   ourselves as elusive in identification as the adventures we seek.
   How else could names such as The Wall of the Early Morning Light
   or Dreams of White Horses come to be without this imagination and
   desire for the unknown. But then again, that is what being a woman
   is all about, an elusive evolving image that we choose to explore
   as we get to know ourselves. Perhaps that is what life can be,
   perhaps that is why mountaineering is a way of life for those who
   are bold and dare. The women climbers that attended this symposium
   reaffirmed this choice.</FONT></P>
