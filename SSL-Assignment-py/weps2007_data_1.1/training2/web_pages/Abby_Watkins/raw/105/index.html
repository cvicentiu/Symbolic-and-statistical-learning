</A> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last season brought a number of new 
  routes and important ascents, completed by parties travelling in a light and 
  fast style. Unfortunately, one of the significant factors influencing parties 
  to climb in this style was the season's abysmal weather. Throughout October 
  and November the Patagonian climate was as bad or worse than that seen in the 
  past by many of the regular aficionados. Some good spells occurred in early 
  December and there were occasional fine days later but by the New Year things 
  had gone dramatically downhill. The snowfall increased to such an extent that 
  the local population were shaking their heads and saying that they had not seen 
  so much snow in the austral summer for more than 15 years. Not surprisingly 
  there was noticeable strain amongst climbers based on the Campo de Agostini 
  (formally the Campo Bridwell) as continuous bad weather led to many unaccomplished 
  dreams.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several visitors this year have been 
  critical of the growing trend to claim routes which end far from the summit. 
  Some of these join other existing routes and others don't even get that far. 
  On the peaks of Patagonia it is generally the last few hundred metres that are 
  unique. As one of the protagonists put it, 'the hardest metre in Patagonia is 
  the last metre, as you have to get there to climb it'. This is particularly 
  true in the normally hostile environment of a region where a few extra hours 
  in the face of an advancing storm can be some of the most terrifying in a climber's 
  career. It may be time once again to look at what constitutes, or not, a 'first 
  ascent'.</font></P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="3"></A></font><A NAME="3">
<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cerro Pollone</font></H3>
</A> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Italians, Luigi Crippa and Lorenzo 
  Nadali, climbed a new route on the South East Face of this 2,579m peak northeast 
  of Piergiorgio on the 19th October. This was the first route to be completed 
  in the Chalten region during the '96-97 season. Towards the end of '95 Nadali, 
  with Mauro Giriadi and Andrea Sarchi, completed Ensueno on the North West Buttress 
  of Fitzroy to the right of the Supercanaleta and had a clear view of Cerro Pollone 
  opposite. It was at this time that Nadali saw a couloir splitting the triangular 
  lower buttress of the face and resolved to go back and try it. Crippa, who is 
  very good on ice (numerous hard winter ascents and ice climbs in the Dolomites 
  as well as, incidentally, a number of mixed routes on Ben Nevis), seemed a suitable 
  partner and the pair spent a week waiting for good weather before crossing the 
  Passo Quadrado on the 18th October. After sleeping for three hours, they continued 
  to the Passo dell'Hombre Sentado close to the start of the climb.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ice in the couloir was perfect 
  and the lower four pitches went easily. They then entered a section, hidden 
  from the base of the climb, where the ice runnel narrowed to 50cm and on occasions 
  was no more than 10-15cm wide and sometimes 5cm thick.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above the rock pyramid, at about 
  half-height on the face, the route crossed much easier ground to the west before 
  starting up the left flank of the final ridge. The pitches were thinly iced 
  and one required some aid but conditions were amazingly good, allowing the pair 
  to progress up thin terrain - so thin they felt that were a similar situation 
  to be found in their homeland, it would be impossible for them to make any upward 
  progress.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last pitch was particularly run 
  out and the pair reached the top (one report states that the actual summit was 
  not reached) in fine weather and light winds. Descent was made by rappel (five 
  in total) following the upper half of the route and then by down-climbing the 
  50-60 glacier slopes behind the initial rock pyramid to reach their camp on 
  the 20th.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new route, christened Mastica 
  e Sputa (Chew and Spit), was 500m long and given an overall alpine grade of 
  ED1 (sections of 80-90: see topo). A French pair, female climber Laurence Bonoyer 
  and Bruno Sourzac, made the second ascent on the 4th December.</font></P>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Piergiorgio</font></H3>
</A> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In November-December 1995, Italians 
  Maurizio Giordani and Gian Luca 'Rampikino' Maspes, attempted a new route up 
  the middle of the North West Face. Gringos Locos has 21 pitches up to 7a and 
  A4 but was terminated well short of the summit (see INFOS 164 and 171) and the 
  ropes left in place for a subsequent attempt. That attempt was due to take place 
  last December but when the pair arrived back at the base of the wall, they found 
  their fixed ropes shredded, despite having taken stringent measures to tension 
  them down.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unwilling to go through the whole 
  operation again, they turned their attentions to a suitable alternative, the 
  unclimbed North East Ridge (which forms the left skyline of the photos published 
  in INFOS 164 and 171). Three difficult pitches led to the col between the Piergiorgio 
  and Cerro Pollone where the pair bivouacked on the night of the 4th December. 
  The following day they moved on to the south flank and climbed 600m of mixed 
  ground (rock to 6a and A2, and ice to WI3/70) to reach the huge summit mushroom 
  which is supposedly unclimbable. The route was christened Esperando la Cumbre.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The North West Face was the scene 
  of a brief attempt on a new route by the French team of St&eacute;phane Benoist, 
  St&eacute;phane Gauard, Pierre Menats and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Thini&egrave;res. 
  These four only managed to climb three pitches and reportedly drilled 40 holes 
  for bat hooks and rivets in only 100m of climbing, before a fall to Gauard, 
  which injured his shoulder and leg, forced the entire team to retreat and concentrate 
  on evacuating the casualty.</font></P>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aguja Bifida</font></H3>
</A> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two new routes were climbed on this 
  2,394m doubled-headed summit which lies on the ridge immediately north of Stanhardt. 
  The strong Italian team of Paolo Cavagnetto, Roberto Giovannetto, Manlio Motto, 
  Gianni Predan and Cesare Ravaschietto arrived in the region during December 
  and hauled gear over the Passo Marconi and on to the Hielo Continental. Although 
  they had no fixed objective except to climb in the remote 'wilderness' side 
  of the range, they chose the West Face of Bifida, as it still had no lines at 
  that date and other faces in the vicinity looked rather too dangerous.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most well-known member of the 
  team, Manlio Motto, is undoubtedly one of the most prolific Alpine rock-climbers 
  in Italy. He has created over 250 routes, mostly from the ground up and with 
  high standard obligatory moves. He is particularly noted for his wide use of 
  bolts on the virgin compact rock of the Mont Blanc Massif and his numerous new 
  routes throughout this region have been widely reported in these pages.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most compelling line on the Bifida 
  was an obvious diedre which rose to a notch just left of the main or North Summit 
  (not reached from any direction until 1989 when an Argentinian/Swiss duo, Bresba 
  and L&uuml;thi, climbed the North East Face: 6a and A1 on mediocre rock). Using 
  fixed ropes on part of the route, the Italians climbed the 16 pitch line to 
  the summit on the 5th-6th and 8th-9th of December. The rock was found to be 
  extremely good and the climbing marvellous. Apart from the stances, which were 
  fully bolted, one bolt and half a dozen pegs were used, with the main source 
  of protection coming from wires and Camalots (up to No. 5). The climbing was 
  mixed free and aid with difficulties up to 6b and A3 (Italian and certain other 
  Continental aid grades appear to be different from those widely used in the 
  USA. The rating depends entirely on the difficulty of the moves and not the 
  fall potential). The route was christened Hielo y Fuego, given an overall Alpine 
  grade of ED2 (see topo) and all members summited.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the weather remained good the 
  team decided to try another line up the pillar leading to the northerly foresummit 
  (more or less an independent summit). This they completed from the 10th-12th 
  with a bivouac at the top of the seventh pitch. This 15 pitch route, christened 
  Su Patagunia, was again on superb and very abrasive rock, though the climbing 
  was perhaps not of the same high quality as Hielo y Fuego. The climb finished 
  on the crest of the ridge facing the Quatro Dedos and had maximum difficulties 
  of 6b+ (one short section of A2). Belays were again equipped and three extra 
  bolts placed for protection. On the 13th the weather turned for the worse and 
  the team evacuated via Piedra del Fraile to Chalten. They note that on this 
  wild side of the range Hielo y Fuego is one of the few routes completed that 
  actually reaches the summit (examples of those that don't include Gracias a 
  la Vida on Punta Herron, Cristalli nell Vento on Cerro Torre and Pepe Rayo on 
  Piergiorgio).</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1994 Anker/Gerberding line of 
  Tomahawk, a direct start to Exocet up the lower wall of the East Face, received 
  its fourth ascent on the 17th January by the talented Spanish climber, Simon 
  Elias and fellow countryman Josu Merino. The 400m ED2 route was found to give 
  ice climbing up to 95 and rock to 5 and A1 (as opposed to the 6a and A2 rating 
  given by the French who made the second and third ascents). The Spaniards had 
  the assistance on the first two pitches of fixed ropes established by another 
  party and climbed the route to within one pitch of the Exocet gully.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only one ascent was recorded of this 
  prestigious mountain during the '96-97 season and this proved to be the first 
  complete ascent of the peak since the 1991-92 season. Spanish climbers, Simon 
  Elias and Josu Merino reached the top on the 18th February having made the sixth 
  ascent of Casimiro Ferrari's 1974 route on the West Face. The Spaniards spent 
  many hours climbing (and digging through) the 20m summit mushroom, which turned 
  out to be the most difficult and dangerous pitch of the entire route. Several 
  years ago, during a filming operation which involved landing a helicopter on 
  the highest point of the Torre, a huge cave was dug in the top of the mushroom 
  to accommodate the film crew and the entrance closed off with a door. It appears 
  that the hole must have caused a significant weakening in the structure and 
  some time later the mushroom keeled over and from all directions presented a 
  formidable challenge. In the last few years parties have avoided climbing this 
  last difficult pitch, considering it either not important or impossible.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later in the season veterans, Maurizio 
  Giarolli and Elio Orlando, climbed nine pitches up a new route on the Torre 
  but could not finish it due to the abysmal weather. They left it fixed and plan 
  to return this October. Not surprisingly, details of the exact line of the attempt 
  are being withheld.</font></P>

  for the 1981 Brenner/Moschini route on the North East Ridge (5 and A1). However, 
  last season it appears the original route was repeated on several occasions, 
  as were the French Couloirs on the East Face (Coquenoit/Guillot and Amy/Vidailhet

  up with Aldo Leviti, a highly noted Dolomite climber with many elegant new routes 
  to his credit, to climb a new line on the North West Face to the right of the 
  1974 Argentinian Route (North West Pillar: Cuinas/Vieiro: 600m: 22 pitches: 
  5+). Their line, which was more or less 700m long, climbed for 16 pitches up 
  the face to join the Argentinian Route on the summit ridge and had difficulties 
  of 6c with a short section of A1. The summit (2,732m: northeast of Fitzroy) 
  was not reached and the climb achieved in a continuous effort of 25 hours from 
  Base Camp to Base Camp. Leviti has prefixed a number of his Dolomite test pieces 
  with the name Iper, e.g. Iperscotoni on the Cima Scotoni and therefore it was 
  no surprise to find this Patagonian route christened Iper Mermoz.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only one ascent has so far been reported 
  of this 3,003m summit south of Fitzroy and this was a new route from the American 
  team of Greg Crouch and Jim Donini. On the 3th and 5th December, immediately 
  after their climb on Rafael (see below), the pair set off for the North Face, 
  approached as for the Carrington/Rouse Route on the West Face, then continuing 
  for a total of 1,300m of mixed ground to the base of the wall at the same point 
  as the West North West Pillar first climbed in 1986 (at 6a and A2: 21 pitches) 
  by the Italian team of Bosisio, Panzeri, Della Santa and Vitali.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The arrival of a storm caught the 
  Americans halfway up the face on the 5th and although they sat it out for the 
  next two nights, their food ran out and they were forced to retreat to a high 
  camp on the 7th. A day later the weather improved and they set off again, spending 
  the night at the top of the fourth pitch and climbing the remaining 13 the following 
  day to the shoulder. The difficulties thus far were rated 5.10+ and A1 and included 
  hard off widths and tight chimneys (see topo). From this point 'the end of the 
  difficulties', the pair, tired from seven days of continuous action, continued 
  for another three hours of pitching, scrambling and intricate route finding 
  to get to the summit. By sunrise the following morning they were back at their 
  bivouac ledge and after a few hours' rest continued down to their camp, having 
  left virtually their entire rack of rappel anchors but well-pleased at having 
  persevered to the true summit. They named the climb The Old Smuggler's Route 
  after the Argentinian whisky that kept them going through the times of bad weather.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Donini (52) this was another

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first route to be completed during 
  the season on Fitzroy was the Supercanaleta (Supercouloir), the 1,700m gash 
  on the North West Face originally climbed in 1965 during the second ascent of 
  the peak by Argentinians, Comesana and Fonrouge. The French pair Pierre Mahenc 
  and Jean-Philippe Tremblai despatched the route in two days over the 2nd-3rd 
  of December. There were short sections of 90 ice and some rock at 6a. The first 
  ascent of the couloir was an impressive achievement for the era by climbers 
  who were completely unknown outside of their own country. The route resisted 
  a second ascent until 1977.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The standard route up the South East 
  Pillar (Franco-Argentinian: 14 pitches normally climbed at 6b and A1, followed 
  by mixed climbing up the summit ridge) was climbed by a six man Russian team 
  which spent 12 days on the route, summiting on the 1st February.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In January 1986 an Italian team from 
  Trieste: Carlo Bormolini, Massimo Boni, Mauro Petronio, Angelo Pozzi, Mauro 
  Rontini and Marco Sterni, climbed the huge North Diedre to give Tehuelche. This 
  1,200m and 46 pitch route was climbed in a final push of seven days. It was 
  mostly free up to 6a but with a short section of 6b and some A1 and A2. The 
  team reported joining the 1979 French Route on the North Face less than 50m 
  from the summit, at which point they terminated their ascent in high winds and 
  rappelled the route.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Argentinian climber, Rolando 
  Garibotti, now resident in Colorado, had dreamed of making an Alpine style ascent 
  of this route ever since copying the original topo at the park headquarters 
  when a teenager of 15. Last December he teamed up with American, Doug Byerly, 
  to do just that. The pair completed the climb in a 34 hours' push over the 8th-9th 
  but found that the point where the Italians had stopped was some 120m from the 
  summit, the first three pitches of which still involved tricky mixed ground.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Byerly and Garibotti's first integral 
  ascent of the route used no fixed ropes, though the pair were dismayed to find 
  the line completely littered with gear from the first ascensionists. The Italians 
  had apparently fixed the entire route and left 1,200m of rope in place. Byerly 
  and Garibotti cut away nearly 90% of the 10 years old decaying material and 
  threw it down to the glacier, together with a 'sack full of rotting clothing 
  left on a stance.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They started out from a high camp 
  at 5am on the 8th in perfect weather but first had to ascend the Sitting Man 
  Ridge, a climb in itself with around 1,000m of moderate ice and sections of 
  mixed terrain. Climbing unroped they reached the top of this ridge in three 
  hours and started up Tehuelche at 11am, finding extremely enjoyable climbing 
  and some of the best granite that either had ever touched.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the first day they climbed with 
  quite heavy packs containing bivouac gear and food for three days. After 20 
  pitches, some of which were wet or icy, they reached a big ledge called the 
  Grand Hotel and stopped for the night. Although it clouded over that evening, 
  the next day dawned fine and the pair continued up the Diedre de Marco, named 
  after Marco Sterni, the star Italian rock-climber who led the entire feature. 
  This gave the hardest climbing on the route and was often difficult to protect 
  due to the off width nature of the cracks. As the day continued warm, the upper 
  pitches became increasingly wet and the finish involved an A1 section up a now 
  gushing waterfall. Several pitches of climbing, still in rock boots, above the 
  point where the Italians turned back led to easier mixed ground and eventually 
  the true summit, a thin blade of granite. The weather remained stable and the 
  pair made it back to the Grand Hotel that night for a few hours' sleep before 
  continuing down to the foot of the wall just 48 hours after starting out. The 
  line, which they comment involves some great free climbing, was completed at 
  6b+ and A2 (see topo).</font></P>

  made the fourth ascent of the original Anglo-American Route via the West Face 
  and South Ridge (Boysen/Braithwaite/Dickenson/Reid (USA)/Sylvester (USA), 1974: 
  5+/6a) on the 2nd December. This gives 450m of splendid and sustained climbing 
  and was the second time Garibotti had climbed the route (he made the third ascent 
  in 1995 with American, Charlie Fowler). This time the pair climbed a new four 
  pitch variation to give the route an overall technical grade of 6b and A0.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the same day, Americans Greg Crouch 
  and Jim Donini, attempted the first ascent of the West Ridge, hoping the route 
  would go easily in the day as a 'warm up' for the season; it didn't. After 24 
  pitches of difficult mixed climbing and rather convoluted route finding, plus 
  a bitterly cold open bivouac, they joined the Anglo-American route at the notch 
  some six pitches short of the summit. Unable to continue above this point due 
  to sheer exhaustion and dehydration the pair retreated. The line had difficulties 
  of 5.10 and A1 plus ice/mixed to 80 but because of their commendably high ethical 
  standards, where any Alpine route is not completed unless the summit is reached, 
  the pair do not consider this a new route (though many current Patagonian activists 
  might) and have declined to name it. Rather it simply felt like 'we had gotten 
  our butts kicked by one of the smallest peaks in the range'.</font></P>

  after their ascent of Rafael, Byerly and Garibotti headed back up for an attempt 
  on the 1988 Giordani/Valentini line Chiaro di Luna on the 800m high West Face. 
  However, due to very cold conditions the pair could not start the climb until 
  midday and then were forced to use aid on the initial cracks which were very 
  iced. Once they moved on to better rock conditions they speeded up and managed 
  to reach the summit in 10 hours, just before dark, after a total of 28 pitches 
  (up to 6c). Rappelling through the dark the rope jammed at around 2am and the 
  pair sat out a very cold night before easily freeing the offending rope in the 
  daylight and continuing safely down to their camp the following morning.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Around on the East Face two members

  Romano and Sinigoi (800m: 5+ and A2: climbed all free at 6c except for one short 
  aid section by Schwitter and Ishibe in 1993). The pair reached the summit on 
  the 27th December.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day later, during a 24 hours 
  period of good weather after a long spell of bad, Garibotti, moving light and 
  fast, managed to solo the 1988 Harrington/Kearney Route (550m: 6a+) on the North 
  West Face. Due to the previous poor weather the conditions were icy which made 
  the climbing slow as each hold had to be checked for verglas. Even so, Garibotti 
  climbed mostly unroped, self-belaying only a few sections and reached the top 
  in fours hours. He was back at camp for afternoon tea.</font></P>

  one of the smallest granite peaks on the main ridge several kilometres south 
  of Fitzroy. From a bivouac at the edge of the glacier above the Rio Blanco Base 
  Camp the pair made their ascent on the 6th February 1996 in excellent weather, 
  climbing first three snow pitches at c60 and then the 10 rock pitches above

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The highest peaks in Chile and also 
  those in Argentina apart from Aconcagua, lie near the southern limits of the 
  Atacama Desert and are rarely visited due to the extreme isolation and lack 
  of water. The Atacama is commonly considered the world's driest desert area. 
  There has been a long debate as to whether Pissis or Ojos del Salado, the latter 
  often referred to as the highest active volcano in the world, is the second 
  highest summit in the Americas after Aconcagua. Recent 'accurate' Argentinian 
  surveys give the benefit of the doubt to Pissis and the Argentine IGM sheet 
  2769-III at 1:250,000, the only accurate topographical map in existence to feature 
  both summits, now marks Ojos as 6,864m and Pissis at 6,882m. There may of course 
  be a little political skulduggery there as Ojos lies on the border with Chile 
  whereas Pissis is entirely within Argentina.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any controversy may well be eliminated 
  after August '97, when Mike Jenkins takes his team of British Military Surveyors 
  from the Royal Engineers to climb Ojos together with a group of like-minded 
  Chilean surveyors. In 1993 Jenkins and his team climbed Chimborazo and made 
  a complex differential GPS survey of the mountain, arriving at an altitude of 
  6,267m, some 40m or so lower than the long accepted height. The Ecuadorians 
  were so impressed with this technique that they now use the new height on all 
  their official maps (see INFO 136). The Argentinians used identical techniques 
  to come up with the height of 6,882m for Pissis in 1995 (see INFO 150) but Ojos 
  has yet to have any such treatment and may yet prove the higher mountain.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jenkins compares today's military 
  surveyors to the old Survey of India team who first explored many of Asia's 
  high peaks in the last century. Names such as George Everest, Colonel Montgomerie 
  and Kenneth Mason ensure a proud tradition of military surveyors and one which 
  still compels the modern day 'descendants' to travel to unknown lands. In October/November 
  1996 three British mountaineers, Gordon and John Biggar plus Richard Wilkins, 
  made some interesting first British ascents in the region including Pissis.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The team approached the largely snowless 
  mountains from the village of Fiambala in Northern Argentina and first made 
  an ascent of the very rarely climbed Cazadero (6,658m), which lies to the southwest 
  of Ojos and is also known as Walther Penck. The volcano was originally climbed 
  by Japanese in 1970 and only appears to have received one ascent since, by a 
  group from Chile in 1991. The British team climbed the easy northern slopes. 
  All three then made an ascent of the Argentinian side of Ojos del Salado, reaching 
  the summit on a cold and windy 31st October.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The group then transferred the 75km 
  south to Pissis and made the ascent on the 10th November via the North Glacier 
  from a high camp at 5,900m. Those final c1,000m took only six hours in near 
  perfect weather, a particularly notable achievement for Gordon Biggar and Wilkins, 
  aged 59 and 60 respectively. Pissis was first climbed by the Poles in 1937 with 
  a second ascent not recorded until 1985. Two Americans, Kent Pierce and Stuart 
  Richie who reached the top on the 27th February this year at the end of a 17 
  days stint, in which they climbed all three highest summits in South America 
  (Pissis reached by a remote cross country drive involving an unauthorized border 
  crossing in to Argentina), found the summit register to contain entries for 
  less than 10 ascents since '85. This lack of attention may soon change if the 
  label 'second highest peak in the Americas' is widely accepted. Most ascents 
  appear to have been made either by very small parties or solo.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Biggar, who has made ascents 
  of over 20 of the 50 highest peaks in the Andes and is the author of the recent 
  publication The High Andes - A Guide for Climbers, went on to solo three more 
  of the volcanoes: Olivares (6,216m), Majadita (6,266m: much further south of 
  Pissis) and Nacimiento del Jague (5,829m). The latter is a subsidiary summit 
  of Nacimiento (6,493m) immediately south of Cazadero and was possibly unclimbed 
  before this ascent.</font></P>

  Canada in his yacht, Dagmar Aaen, with a crew of Germans, one Alaskan and one 
  Icelandic girl. They were joined in Valparaiso by Chilean mountaineer, Pablo 
  Besser, on the 1st October 1995. After considerable bureaucratic problems with 
  the Chilean government, they all set sail for Canal Baker and the Jorge Montt 
  Glacier at the northern end of the ice cap.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Fuchs and team began their 
  journey south, the boat sailed to the Peel Fjord and Besser, with the Icelandic 
  girl Sigga Ragna Sverrisdotir, an excellent ice climber, travelled over 55km 
  in an inflatable dingy to the head of the Peel. There they climbed up a steep 
  and previously unexplored glacier, christened Margarita Glacier, on to the ice 
  cap. Pulling 30 days food and equipment on pulks, they finally reached the Japan 
  Plateau and headed east for two days to make their first Base Camp near to the 
  Malaspina Mountains. From there they climbed Cerro Centinel (2,393m) in poor 
  conditions and Cerro Dagmar Aaen (2,050m), the latter in soft snow ending with 
  a 50m ice pitch and a classic Patagonian mushroom.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a spell of bad weather they 
  moved camp to the base of Cerro Immaculado (2,374m) where they made the first 
  ascents of Immaculado, Mirador del Hielo (2,078m), Punta Ilusion (2,533m) and 
  Punta Aparicion (2,100m). These have now been adopted as official names and 
  heights on 1996 versions of maps to the area. Besser and Sverrisdotir were also 
  the first to cross the Garcia Glacier and Col 1,300m or Corredor Chileno.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fuchs, with team members Till Gottbrath 
  and Roger Schmitt, met up with the pair on the 20th November but a 10 day storm, 
  which destroyed one of the tents, put paid to the journey further south and 
  the entire team traversed the Falle de Reichert (Mayo Fall), a c1,000m chasm 
  of seracs cutting the ice cap never before crossed except by helicopter, and 
  reached the Peel Fjord on the 3rd December. While completing this route, Besser, 
  Gottbrath, Schmitt and Sverrisdotir made the first ascent of Cerro Cuatro Vientos.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The significance of the 'Arved Cross' 
  is that it was the longest north-south traverse of the ice cap yet made without 
  helicopter support or mid journey stop for a rest and re-stock. Besser hoped 
  to return with three friends and make the first complete traverse of all 500km 
  of the Hielo Sur during the 1996-97 season but the outcome of this proposed 
  expedition is still unknown.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An interesting west to east traverse 
  of the ice cap took place in March '96 when Germans, Carsten Birckhahn, Merten 
  Puschmann and Tilman Steinhardt, took just over four weeks to travel from Peel 
  Fjord to the Lago Argentina. They first reached the fjord with plastic kayaks 
  and then, using them as pulks, dragged their equipment 1,000m up on to the ice 
  cap and continued east. Their original project was to carry on down via the 
  Santa Cruz river all the way to the Atlantic coast but it is thought that this 
  part of their novel journey may well have been aborted.</font></P>

  of the Cuernos, the Chilean pair of Sven Bruchfeld and Christian Oberli made 
  the first ascent of the East Face of Hoja in January. This 14 pitch, c400m route 
  was climbed in classic style using fixed ropes at a reported grade of 5.10a

  graded 5.11 and A1 and then a route on the East Face of Hoja, which they christened 
  Anduril (the relation between this and the Chilean Route a month previously

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In INFO 170 we reported ascents in 
  the Negruni/Jankho Kkota region of the Central Cordillera Real. The mountains 
  to the north of the Jankho Kkota valley, in which the 1996 British party climbed, 
  are referred to as the Warawarini and Keakeani groups on the new Cordova map. 
  However, the American cartographer, Liam O'Brien, has made extensive research 
  into this region, delineated in the north by the Chachacomani Pass (c5,200m) 
  south of the Chachacomani Massif, and discovered that the highest summit, Pt 
  5,670m, first climbed in 1964 by Japanese, repeated in 1995 by O'Brien and then 
  again in '96 by the British party, should strictly be called Jallawaya I after 
  the main river valley that drains the mountain to the south. Following the convention 
  of naming a group of mountains by the highest peak, he proposes that this whole 
  range of mountains, which probably contains around 50 summits over 5,000m, should 
  logically be named the Jallawaya Group. German climbers, Edi Birnbacher and 
  Stefan Wiebel, chose to visit the Jallawaya-Negruni region in February 1997. 
  This is the austral summer, the rainy season and a time in which few ever visit 
  the mountains. However, the German pair were aware that in recent years glacial 
  recession had been significant and steep faces melted quickly with the arrival 
  of the customary fine weather in late May-June, leaving vast areas of bare rotten 
  rock (although not all the granite in this region is poor). Certainly by mid-June 
  many of the couloirs used by parties that made the first ascents of these fine 
  peaks in the early 1970s, are now snow-free, stone-swept chutes. While the Germans 
  found large quantities of snow on the mountains and acceptable conditions for 
  mixed climbing, they unfortunately coincided with the worst wet season for 30 
  years and experienced copious amounts of bad weather.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the 10th February they climbed 
  a new route, Pan Duro, on the right side of the South West Face of Cerro Culin 
  Thojo South (5,350m). This 450m high mixed climb had rock difficulties of IV 
  and snow/ice to 65/70. Three pegs were left in the rotten rock. Two days later 
  they climbed Andal&eacute;, a 380m mixed route up the North Couloir of Pt 5,350m 
  to the west of Cerro Ventanani. Again the rock was poor (IV- maximum) and the 
  snow/ice climbing between 55-65 with one section of 70.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, on the 14th, the pair climbed 
  the East Face of Pt 5,400m, the location of which is unclear though it is described 
  as a subsidiary peak of Wila Lloje. The 350m climb, christened Caramba, which 
  involved rock to IV+ and snow/ice to 65-70, was again primarily composed of 
  loose blocks and the ubiquitous rotten rock. Two pegs and a sling were abandoned 
  on the climb. All these peaks or sub peaks lie close to the valley and most 
  probably received their first ascents during 1971-73 when two large German expeditions 
  explored the region. However, it is quite possible that the recent exploration 
  by the two Germans produced the first new routes ever climbed in the Cordillera 
  during the summer.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the 16th a big landslide destroyed 
  the 4WD access road, which now continues over the Paso Mullu and down to the 
  jungle villages. Birnbacher and Wiebel had no option but to walk out to the 
  main highway, a distance of 30km. Despite this, they report removing all rubbish 
  from their Laguna Janko Kkota Base Camp, returning it too La Paz for recycling. 
  Unfortunately, rubbish disposal in La Paz usually takes the form of moving it 
  from the richer to the poorer areas i.e. El Alto.</font></P>

</A> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1994, Ivar Erik Tollefsen led 
  a Norwegian expedition to Dronning Maud Land on mainland Antarctica. The expedition 
  gained considerable media attention and produced a fine book which detailed 
  the various stages of the project including the first ascent, from the 24th 
  January-4th February of Ulvetanna (2,931m) via a 990m climb up the North West 
  Face (VIII+ and A2). The route was climbed in capsule style by Robert Caspersen, 
  a very talented rock-climber and one of Norway's former indoor champions, the 
  very experienced Sjur Nesheim and Tollefsen.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late 1996, Tollefsen again led 
  a small team to Queen Maud Land, this time to the Sor Rondane, a region of mountains 
  never previously visited by a climbing expedition. Together with a four person 
  media team, Tollefsen, Caspersen, Aslak Aastorp and H&aring;kon Staver first 
  flew by chartered Hercules from Cape Town to the Fenrisskjeften on the Icecap, 
  the venue for the 1994 expedition. From there a ski-equipped twin otter aircraft 
  took the team 600km east to a Base Camp in the mountain range of Sor Rondane. 
  From here they spent 17 days climbing the 830m high South East Face of Rondespiret.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rondespiret is a 'Trango Tower'-like 
  granite peak and the four climbed the obvious pillar and corner system on the 
  left side of the face in 20 sustained pitches of mixed free and aid climbing 
  up to new wave A3+ and VI+ (see topo). Extremely strong winds combined with 
  cold stable weather caused many problems, especially on the lower half of the 
  route. On Ulvetenna in 1994 Caspersen and team had found the granite often loose 
  and friable due, no doubt, to the harsh and variable climatic environment. This 
  time the four Norwegians, again climbing in capsule style, found mostly good 
  steep granite with a few notable and serious exceptions and completed the route 
  from the 23rd December - 8th January.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As reported in INFO 173 two new routes 
  were completed in the Alaskan Cathedral Range, more popularly known as the Kichatna 
  Spires, during June 1996 by 19 years old American, Calder Stratford, and British 
  climber Kevin Thaw. Thaw, who took up partial residence in the USA in the late 
  '80s and is now more or less resident there, was the first British climber to 
  lead consensus A5 with his ascent of Sea of Dreams on Yosemite's El Capitan 
  in 1994.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pair were flown into the unfrequented 
  region south of the McKinley group on the 29th May and deposited on the Tatina 
  Glacier. Heeding the advice that when the unpredictable weather sets fair in 
  this region, climbers should not waste any time (there are no real hours of 
  darkness at this latitude until August), the pair set out for a fine granite 
  wall on an unnamed 2,560m peak immediately west of Tatina Spire. The south buttress 
  of what they later dubbed Punter's Peak, gave seven 60m pitches to the interminable 
  summit ridge. This in turn offered easy Fifth Class climbing with the occasional 
  boulder problem. Two days were spent on the buttress and ropes were fixed (single 
  bolt belays) on to the headwall where flaring cracks and loose exfoliating flakes 
  gave more free climbing. Three of the pitches, crossing a series of roofs, were 
  entirely on aid (modern A3 with much use of copperheads and skyhooks). The free 
  climbing standard on the rest reached a maximum of 5.10. The route was christened 
  Dreams of Sea and given an overall V rating.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The weather turned bad for the next 
  10 days or so, then miraculously cleared three days before the pre-arranged 
  flight out. Stratford and Thaw quickly assembled gear for an attempt on a southern 
  satellite of Tatina Spire and starting just right of the lowest point of the 
  south buttress, free climbed the often lichenous wall, which prompted the route 
  name Alaskan Rose, to the golden headwall. This formed the crux and had some 
  run out climbing with a steep crack/trough at 5.11c. More lichen forced them 
  out left into a corner system near the top. They reached the summit after a 
  total of nine long pitches, placing single bolt belays backed up with rivets. 
  Alaskan Rose was also rated V. Though these two routes were fairly short, they 
  were probably the steepest that the valley had to offer.</font></P>

  apt that the first party into the region should have as one of its members the 
  greatest of all American pioneers, the indefatigable Fred Beckey. Together with 
  Calvin Herbert and the well-known big wall guru, John Middendorf, Beckey, who 
  has now climbed over 1,000 new routes in North America, attempted the unnamed 
  highest summit in the group. The only real technical piece of climbing involved 
  a 5.5 loose rock wall to gain the fine summit snow ridge. Beckey led this pitch

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Valley experienced a ravaging 
  wet year in 1996. The season had barely started when a huge storm hit the area. 
  Several feet of snow then began to melt quickly in the warmth of May and the 
  resulting run off caused the rivers to flood. The Merced burst its banks causing 
  havoc in the campgrounds and washing away both possessions and aspirations of 
  visiting climbers. Perhaps not entirely unrelated to this deluge was the huge 
  rockfall on the 10th July from close to the rim above Glacier Point Apron. This 
  event, which has already been well-reported in a previous High, flattened one 
  and a half metre diameter trees nearly one kilometre away and killed one person. 
  The fall left everything covered with large quantities of dust and a huge area 
  of scarred earth with unstable boulders perched high above the Apron. The Park 
  Authorities closed the area from Goodrich Pinnacle east, which includes routes 
  on the Mouth and the Cow and also the line of Galactic Hitchhiker, perhaps the 
  longest free rock climb in the USA, completed in the autumn of 1995 by Matt 
  Brooks and Lou Renner at VI, 5.11a/b. This route, described in High 173, has 
  41 pitches to the rim, out of which 31 are new. It remains to be seen whether 
  routes such as these are still entirely intact.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To add insult to injury the season 
  ended with the usual, if somewhat premature, snowfall. However, this was later 
  followed by a warm wet storm. For the second time in a year the Merced broke 
  its banks and welled up over the valley floor, this time creating the biggest 
  flood in history with considerably more devastation than its spring counterpart. 
  Several campgrounds were totally washed away, as was a sewerage line, and many 
  large boulders were deposited on various roads around the park. The Cookie cliff 
  suffered considerable fresh rockfall, as did many of the other crags which line 
  Highway 140 between El Portal and the Valley. The worse flooding appears to 
  have been caused by debris clogging up the watercourse at Pohono Bridge near 
  to Bridalveil Falls. The resulting dam forced water back in to the Valley and 
  briefly closed all the Park exits. At one stage Yosemite Lodge, Yosemite Village 
  and Curry Village were all isolated from one another by flood water. A large 
  boulder destroyed the dining room of the Parkline Restaurant at El Portal and 
  the rest of the building was burned in order to prevent debris from creating 
  another blockage. Both Pines campgrounds, the River campgrounds and the Housekeeping 
  area suffered major damage and some of these may never re-open. However, Sunnyside, 
  the traditional climbers' camp, is some distance above the river and appears 
  to have survived relatively unscathed. The Park remained closed from January-March 
  '97 and although at the time of writing details of the current situation are 
  unknown, the repair cost has been estimated at around $180,000,000. There is 
  a rumour that the Park Service may try to introduce a system of one day permits 
  for visitors, though whether this would effect climbers attempting multi-day 
  routes is unsure.</font></P>

  American Brad Jarret also climbing solo; fourth in 1993 by the Slovenians, Janez 
  Jeglic and Miha Prapotnik). The Swiss-Norwegian pair climbed the 23 pitch route 
  (VI, 5.10, A5), which begins above the Mammoth Ledges on the South West Face 
  between The Shield and Son of Heart, in seven days from the 4th to the 10th 
  June. Their ascent was made in Alpine style without fixing ropes. The pair used 
  epoxy putty to reinstate much of the original hard climbing by filling up many 
  of the drilled holes added after the Cole/Grossman ascent. As one activist said 
  'there have been a mistaken few in the past who have sought out glory on the 
  big walls and reduced the commitment by drilling for security'. Sadly, Rupp 
  was killed earlier this year in a rappel accident while descending the Hornli 
  Ridge on the Matterhorn having just completed a very fast winter ascent of the 
  North Face.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Born in 1968 from mixed German-Tadjikistan 
  parentage, Rupp was no newcomer to the Yosemite scene having visited the Valley 
  on a regular basis over the past few years and had completed 10 big wall routes 
  on El Cap. His tally included: the first solo and fifth overall ascent of Native 
  Son (VI, 5.9, A4+) to the right of The North America Wall/Gulf Stream routes 
  on the South East Face (climbed in 1991); in 1992 the sixth ascent of Aurora 
  (VI, 5.8 and A5) with Oyvind Moss, and in 1993 the first single-push ascent 
  of Sunkist (VI, 5.9, A4) in 26 hours with Garibotti (the route had received 
  less than 10 ascents at the time). In the same year he made a nine hours ascent 
  of the Salath&eacute; Wall, also with Garibotti.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps falling into the category 
  of climbers who have 'reduced the commitment by drilling for security', is the 
  pair who completed the now controversial Wings of Steel. They were busy drilling 
  on El Cap for over a month, with the drill heard on a daily basis. Even a Park 
  ranger was prompted to turn out to discourage their cause. This route seems 
  to avoid any available features, instead taking a blank plum line directly up 
  the wall. The tactics apparently used were to drill small holes into which copperheads 
  could be pasted. The second would then consistently chop the head cables flush 
  with the rock, rendering each placement useless for a subsequent ascent.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast, a highly praised event 
  in May, on which no additional drilling appears to have taken place, was the 
  second ascent of the infamous 1987 offering from Randy Leavitt and the late 
  Rob Slater named Scorched Earth. Chris Kalous and Chris Righter spent five days 
  completing this VI, 5.11, A5 route. The crux pitch - the Big Brother - involves 
  hard copperheading in rotten rock and a single hook move requiring a device 
  which Leavitt dubbed a Lovetron. Kalous and Righter also used their version 
  of a Lovetron, a tent pole with a steering wire and a skyhook attached to the 
  end for an extremely long reach. Later, Kalous and Rubecca Rusch had made another 
  important second ascent when they spent seven days climbing Bermuda Dunes (VI, 
  5.11, A4).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kalous kept a busy big wall schedule 
  in 1996. In March he made a solo 'winter' ascent of the Cap, starting up the 
  first eight pitches of Lost in America (VI, 5.10, A5) then making a short traverse 
  on to Tangerine Trip (VI, 5.9, A3), finishing on the summit after a total of 
  nine days on the face. He and Righter also took their experience to the Cirque 
  of the Unclimbables in the summer and with Kevin Daniels and Gregg Epperson 
  added another hard wall route, Grendel (VI, 5.10, A4), to Mount Proboscis.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sadly, the late spring was also the 
  scene of a fatality on El Cap when American, Mathew Baxter, was killed while 
  attempting to solo Zenyatta Mondatta. Baxter took what should have been a short 
  fall on the third pitch but his backrope got jammed behind a flake and cut through.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the spring water had subsided, 
  17 years old San Francisco climber, Chris McNamara, completed Sea of Dreams 
  (VI, A5) with Mark Melvin and Wyoming Sheep Ranch (VI, A5) with Eric Sloan. 
  Another successful ascent of this last named route was made by Wally Barker. 
  Returning from a productive trip to Baffin Island, where with Kohn Rysekchi 
  he completed new routes on Asgard and Friga, Barker despatched the route solo. 
  Slovenians added another of the big nail-ups to their tally when Boris Lorencic 
  and Armand Polegek climbed Aurora (VI, 5.8, A5) in six days after fixing the 
  first four pitches. Eric Kohl, who has established over 20 big wall routes in 
  the Park, most of them solo, added another to the nearby Falls Wall but details 
  are unknown.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There were, again, many notable speed 
  ascents of routes on the walls. The prolific team of Dave Bengston, Steve Gerberding 
  and Scott Stowe were, as usual, well-motivated. They began with the first ever 
  continuous ascent of Iron Hawk (VI, 5.10, A4) in 33 hours and 50 minutes. Their 
  next project was a continuous ascent of Lost in America (VI, 5.10, A4) which 
  they despatched in a very rapid 26 hours and 55 minutes. The same three also 
  set a speed record for Lunar Eclipse, completing this line in 23 hours 24 minutes. 
  Bengston and Stowe then teamed up with Conrad Anker for a record 20 hours and 
  two minutes ascent of Mirage (VI, 5.10, A4), while Anker, this time with Hans 
  Florine and Mark Melvin reduced the record time for an ascent of the North America 
  Wall to under 24 hours, completing this VI, 5.10, A3 route in just 21 hours 
  and 48 minutes. Florine and young Chris McNamara stomped up the Muir Wall (VI, 
  5.10, A2+) in a record 23 hours and 24 minutes.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two important solo record ascents 
  were achieved in 1996. Argentinian-born Damien Benegas made an ascent of the 
  classic Zenyatta Mondatta (VI, 5.9, A4) in an unrelenting 37 hours and 30 minutes, 
  while Kevin Thaw took only 20 hours and eight minutes to overcome the often 
  wide cracks of the equally classic West Buttress (VI, 5.10, A3). Benegas has 
  now climbed El Cap wall routes on more than 50 occasions, a total of ascents 
  possibly only beaten by the prolific Steve Gerberding, who has now climbed the 
  'captain' on well over 70 occasions.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having warmed up by climbing the 
  Regular Route on Half Dome (see below) and making an ascent of Zodiac, American 
  resident Abby Watkins and fellow Australian, Vera Wong, beat Nancy Feagin and 
  Sue McDevitt's all female record for The Nose, lowering the time to 16 hours 
  and 30 minutes. The pair began the route at 5am on the 26th September and had 
  to climb over and around six other parties before reaching the top.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 1996 also marked the third 
  all free ascent of the Salath&eacute;. This time it was the turn of Thomas Huber, 
  brother to Alex who made the well-publicized second ascent. Thomas led all the 
  pitches including the 19th (5.13a) and the two 5.13b pitches on the headwall.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In July, Peter Coward and the well-known 
  Valley speed climber, Hans Florine, achieved the remarkable feat of linking 
  the Regular and Direct Routes on the North West Face in a single day. The Direct 
  was climbed in a record 12 hours and the Regular in three hours and 42 minutes. 
  This inspired various other fast ascents on the wall and in mid-August Coward 
  and Florine returned, driving from San Francisco, climbing the Regular Route 
  in just one minute over three hours and driving back in under 24 hours.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The all-women's record for this route 
  was also beaten last year when the Australians, Abby Watkins and Vera Wong, 
  climbed the route in just nine hours and 45 minutes. Wong and Willy Benegas 
  also reportedly completed the Direct Route in 11 hours and 45 minutes.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last word, however, came on Friday 
  the 13th of September, when the well-known Slovenian, Silvo Karo, teamed up 
  with Aischan Rupp (making his second short trip to the Valley last year) to 
  climb the Direct in probably a new record time of 11 hours and 20 minutes. The 
  pair felt that this time could easily be improved, as conditions for the ascent 
  were far from ideal. Halfway up the route it started to rain and this turned 
  to snow near the top...</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In parallel to the tremendous activity 
  in Europe this winter, which successfully appears to have raised the technical 
  standards of the new-wave 'mixed' climbing (reported in the next issue), America 
  has also seen its share of impressive performances in 1997 and there is now 
  a definite trend towards working and redpointing short, difficult mixed problems.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big 'breakthrough' of the season 
  was Will Gadd's route Amphibian, a two-pitch, bolt protected line in the near 
  vicinity of Octopussy at the 'laboratory' of Vail. After considerable time and 
  effort bolting the route from above, Gadd worked on the line for three weeks 
  before making a clean lead of every section. The route is a little over 50m 
  long, with the top overhanging the base by around 15m.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has two pitches, the first of 
  which Gadd, a noted Canadian sport climber, redpointed at the beginning of March 
  and the second, somewhat harder pitch a week or so later. However, he was apparently 
  unable climb the entire route in one complete ascent. A rating of M9 or even 
  M9+ placed it in a new league of mixed climbing and made it a full grade harder 
  than test pieces such as Octopussy. The first pitch, which is around 22m in 
  length and graded 9-, climbs an overhanging rock wall on which there is absolutely 
  no ice whatsoever. The second involves a start on ice followed by two horizontal 
  roofs of about 6m each and separated by an icicle (at the top of which it is 
  possible to get a good rest), then more ice above the roofs to reach the top.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quickly on the scene was Stevie Haston. 
  This was Haston's second visit to the USA to climb ice during the winter, the 
  first involving attendance at the ESPN ice climbing competition set up by Jeff 
  Lowe, and the Ouray Ice Festival. Haston has spent almost six months this winter 
  concentrating solely on his ice/mixed climbing, on average three and sometimes 
  five days a week. This appears to have paid off with a remarkable series of 
  new routes, details of which will appear in the next issue when we review the 
  European Alpine winter.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On his first visit in January/February 
  he repeated Jeff Lowe's hard mixed route of 1996, Resurrection. This is a typical 
  Vail climb, overcoming seriously impending rock to reach a free hanging icicle. 
  Lowe placed protection (no bolts) on aid then worked the route like a sport 
  climb. He felt it had a longer series of moves than Octopussy (in its original 
  condition) but was about the same order of technical difficulty. He rated it 
  M8. Haston flashed it, finding it an excellent though complex mixed climb and 
  felt it to be 8-/8. Over in the Ice Park of Ouray, Haston climbed a scary 7/7+ 
  which in some ways he felt was the hardest thing he did all winter. The route 
  took a slender, tapering hanging icicle that was only possible to climb by hooking 
  and hugging. It was top roped first as it was initially thought too fragile 
  for a complete ascent.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Box Canyon at Ouray was home 
  to around 450 climbers and an equal number of spectators for the Festival. As 
  reported in a previous INFO, pure ice climbs are artificially created here using 
  sprinkler valves on a large waterpipe that runs around the rim. Though most 
  climbs are top roped, the routes still make very fine leads. These half or one 
  pitch climbs can be changed at will (well, in about three days to a week) and 
  the atmosphere is very friendly with the town encouraging climbing and giving 
  discounts to visiting climbers. Many of these visitors are now performing at 
  a very high standard, reaching grade 6 after just a few weekends. Notable routes 
  are Bloody Sunday (7) by Mark Wilford and a second route at the same grade by 
  Will Gadd and his usual partner on the ice, the prolific resident climber from 
  Iceland, Helgi Christensen.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Haston's second visit to the USA 
  appears to have been even more productive. Now at his strongest ever, he first 
  repeated Pete Takeda's recent route, Fat Man and Robin, originally worked over 
  several days. The route involves a three metre overhang and was graded 9- by 
  the first ascensionists. Haston came close to flashing it and on his subsequent 
  ascent felt that in reality it was probably only 8+. Fat Man and Robin is another 
  line in the immediate vicinity of The Fang and Octopussy at Vail, starting with 
  the usual section of overhanging rock leading to a stalactite with the crux 
  roof at the top.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amphibian took him two days. On the 
  first session Haston had to resort to rest points on the top pitch but completed 
  it clean on the second day. The first pitch was thought to be 8+ rather than 
  9-. The initial roof on the second pitch he found to be quite juggy and he did 
  it without ice tools or gloves (where possible this does less damage to the 
  rock and Gadd had taken a fall here when an axe placement broke). The second 
  he climbed at 9-.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Haston's feeling is that the leading 
  American climbers are making very real but smaller progress than was first thought 
  and the top grade is being expanded somewhat disproportionately. He also feels 
  that his new routes Welcome to the Machine and 009 in Italy's Val Savaranche, 
  now possibly the first genuine M9s in the world, have harder and more powerful 
  moves and equally more demanding and fragile ice, though are not as long as 
  the routes at Vail. Before leaving the USA Haston turned his overworked arms 
  to the desert sandstone and became the first person to climb one of the main 
  Fisher Towers without aid when he spent three days cleaning, working and then 
  free climbing Echo Tower by the line of Phantom Spirit.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hard mixed routes being put up 
  in Europe at present, of which Trait de Lune, a 40m high unconfirmed M8+ in 
  the eastern region of Switzerland's Jura mountains by the well-known German 
  Alpinist, Robert Jasper, is another example, need crampons to both start and 
  finish the climbing (Jasper's route includes an impressive bulge climbed free 
  with bare hands, crampons and the somewhat limiting effect of full winter clothing 
  and still thought to be around F7a+/7b). Amphibian, in contrast, has a first 
  pitch that is entirely on rock. It may now be time to re-assess what proportion 
  of pure, un-iced rock should exist on a route in order for it to still be considered 
  a 'mixed' climb, even by American standards. The potential for climbing long 
  rock walls to reach small hanging icicles is still vast and 'dry tooling' is 
  all the rage. Certain climbers had suggested taking their axes and crampons 
  to the sport cliff of Rifle until they were made to realize the damage such 
  an act would do to existing rock climbs.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newcomer, Gary Ryan, also felt he 
  had made a breakthrough by climbing Blade Runner at the popular Loch Vale area 
  in Rocky Mountain National Park. This route ascends 18m of overhanging granite 
  to reach a thin ice curtain leading 12m to the top and is situated very close 
  to several other recently created mixed routes. Ryan, brother of the British 
  rock-climber Tony Ryan and now an American resident, placed three bolts plus 
  four pegs then began working Blade Runner in late February. On one of his attempts 
  he had almost reached the top and was pulling on a small tree root when it snapped, 
  resulting in a spectacular fall. Ryan finally redpointed the route on the 5th 
  March, giving it a rating of M9.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsequent appraisal by certain other 
  climbers and a flashed second ascent by Will Gadd confirmed that the standard 
  was no more than M8. Ryan's subsequent failure to climb Resurrection seems to 
  bear this out. However, Ryan, a very strong climber, undoubtedly did make a 
  meteoric impact on the climbing world, taking to the ice for the first time 
  after 18 years of rock-climbing. He quickly on sighted Secret Probation (M7) 
  at Vail and then went on to make only the second on sight ascent of Octopussy. 
  Other routes include a repeat of David Sheldon's Free Strike Zone (M7+) and 
  a new route at Ouray, Easter Rising, which he gave a grade of M8+, though this 
  again is now widely believed to be somewhat over rated.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the potential at Vail drying 
  up, other venues are now being examined. At Glenwood Canyon, Gadd and Jeff Lowe 
  climbed Deep Throat, a five star 7+ that apart from a few metres of rock in 
  its 45m length is entirely on ice. Another M8 has also been reported, this time 
  in the Cascade Canyon region of the state, where Big Wall climber Jared Ogden 
  and partner climbed Against the Grain. The route actually followed the line 
  of a hard, but yet to be redpointed, F7b bolted rock-climbing project, negotiating 
  a roof to reach ice above.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have been attempts recently 
  to equate ice to rock grades in order to try to answer the question as to what 
  level mixed climbing is at relative to rock (Gadd felt that Amphibian felt equivalent 
  to a 5.13 sport climb). Although it is obviously impossible to make a direct 
  comparison, the following consensus at present gives a very rough indication 
  of the physical difficulty involved with making an ascent of a short, hard but 
  well-protected route such as those found at Vail: M6 = 5.10+ or F6b+ (or well-protected 
  E3)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">M7 = 5.11 or 6b+ to 7a (or well-protected 
  E5)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">M8 = 5.12 or 7a+ to 7b+</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">M9 = 5.12 to 5.13 or 7c to 8a</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">M10 = 8a+ to 8b+?</font></P>
