            &nbsp;&nbsp; It's a soft, gray morning. The ground is blanketed by 
            eight centimeters of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free, 
            and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry 
            skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in 
            eastern British Columbia.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not alone. The mountain guides 
            spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular 
            Balu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's a beautiful day out here, isn't 
            it?&quot; says Abby. &quot;Yes,&quot; someone responds.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They leave the 14 teenagers and three 
            adults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed 
            area.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby looks back at the people below 
            and a gangly teen, all arms and legs, catches her eye. &quot;Aren't 
            kids funny? Look at that kid,&quot; she tells Rich.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that very moment, just before noon 
            on Saturday, something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops 
            Mountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horror 
            as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris. 
            The school group is directly in its path.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich screams: &quot;Avalanche! Avalanche! 
            Avalanche!&quot;<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Ben Albert is frantically trying to cram his day pack 
            into a big black backpack already bulging with clothes, equipment 
            and enough food for a breakfast and stir-fry dinner for himself and 
            three other hungry 15-year-olds. He finally wedges it in and staggers 
            out the door. It's early Friday morning.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother, Carol Neale, watches uneasily 
            as he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to the 
            Canadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary. There, Ben 
            will rendezvous with 13 other Grade 10 students from the elite Strathcona-Tweedsmuir 
            private school for a long weekend of backcountry, telemark skiing, 
            a difficult activity that combines cross-country and downhill.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip is the culmination of two 
            months of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school's 
            celebrated, year-long outdoor education program.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the early hour, the excitement 
            among the 11 boys and three girls is infectious. Michael Shaw is so 
            keyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn. 
            She tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are close, these healthy, strong, 
            accomplished 15-year-olds. Many have grown up together.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael and his best pal Taylor Carcasole 
            are there, in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass. 
            The two are inseparable. Teachers know them as &quot;mischief.&quot; 
            Taylor is the &quot;mis,&quot; and Michael the &quot;chief.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben Albert sees Scott Broshko and Jeff 
            Trickett. They are three parts of a group of four talented teens known 
            as the &quot;Fearsome Foursome.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott has been talking about the expedition 
            almost nonstop since training began. Outdoor trips are his passion. 
            For his birthday, he asked for a sleeping bag.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before, Daniel Arato bombarded 
            his older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father had left a day earlier for 
            his own ski trip. The two exchanged kisses and hugs. Mr. Arato told 
            his son to keep his head in the game and do what he's told. As the 
            two parted, Daniel told his dad: &quot;I love you.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leader of the expedition is teacher 
            Andrew Nicholson, a skilled and experienced skier, well-trained in 
            avalanche awareness. He is so demanding in checking snow conditions 
            that previous groups have dubbed him &quot;Nazi Nick.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents have signed waivers protecting 
            the school in the event of deaths or injuries, but Carol Neale is 
            worried. She can't stop thinking about an avalanche less than two 
            weeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just 
            40 kilometers away from where Ben and his classmates are headed.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Broshko's mother, Donna, knows 
            about that avalanche, too. But she thinks: &quot;What is the likelihood? 
            Just what is the likelihood of that?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gives him a quick hug. He'll be 
            back on Monday.</font></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; It's a four-hour journey to Glacier National Park. The 
            winding, 350-kilometre drive along the Trans-Canada Highway west from 
            Calgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country, replete 
            with neck-craning mountain walls and stomach-churning sheer drops 
            to valleys below.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way are warning signs for 
            fallen rocks and avalanche debris. Runaway lanes for truckers who 
            lose their brakes on the steep inclines are common.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more ominous are five long avalanche 
            tunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularly 
            cut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an annual average snowfall of 
            up to 21 meters, the area has one of the deadliest concentrations 
            of avalanches in the world -- enough to keep an on-site military unit 
            stationed there, equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring down 
            threatening avalanches before they become dangerous.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vans arrive at the park about noon, 
            and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters, 
            the A.O. Wheeler Hut, an easy two-kilometer trek from the highway. 
            The A-frame log building, complete with two wood stoves and propane 
            systems for cooking and light, is nestled in a cedar forest. The cabin 
            sleeps 24 in three rooms.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teenagers stow their large packs 
            and, after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr. Nicholson, they 
            start to ski, exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoon 
            and giddy with the fresh mountain air.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, exhausted from their 
            wonderful afternoon, the students are divided into groups. Each prepares 
            its own dinner. Marissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolate 
            fondue. Scott Broshko's dines on quesadillas, much to the envy of 
            another group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the night, snoring from Scott 
            and his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the 11 boys in the same room 
            from sleeping.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time they wake Saturday morning, 
            Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry 
            skiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has been 
            assessed as &quot;considerable,&quot; the mid-range of the five possible 
            ratings.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below the tree line, the risk is assessed 
            as &quot;moderate,&quot; with natural avalanches unlikely. And the 
            STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark 
            expedition to Balu Pass.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bulletin also refers to weak 
            snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed 
            to stabilize. There were similar references for the same mountain 
            range in avalanche bulletins last month, just before the deadly slide 
            that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke, B.C.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group makes its way to the Rogers 
            Pass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod 
            and timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholson 
            goes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before heading 
            back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and 
            a chaperone.<br>

            The group decides it is safe to ski that day. By 10:15 a.m., they 
            are on the trailhead to the pass, five kilometers away, described 
            by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy, but beautiful trail. They ski 
            through forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge and 
            into the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deep 
            powder snow, the scenery is breathtaking.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere. 
            Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the 
            years have littered the area with rocks and stumps. Foliage is sparse 
            on the valley floor.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school group successfully crosses 
            four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and three 
            on the south side. They note that the debris from one avalanche path 
            across the valley is no more than a week old.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are halfway to their destination.</font></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanche 
            hits them head on.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiers 
            are swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The swiftness and power of the avalanche 
            sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. &quot;A 
            huge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration 
            of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobody 
            could have got out of the way. Nobody.&quot;<br>

            The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. A 
            section of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a number 
            of victims hundreds of meters down the valley. Disoriented and tumbling 
            head over foot with little chance to &quot;swim&quot; to the surface, 
            this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 meters beneath the concrete-hard 
            snow.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up in the trees, Abby and Rich are 
            dusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over the 
            valley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions. 
            On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for years 
            to put into practice.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They race down to the first group of 
            buried skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs 
            poking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at the 
            bottom of the valley, are buried much deeper.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wife 
            team is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everybody would make it, they reason. 
            But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich runs for the first hand he sees 
            and begins digging. It's Andrew Nicholson. He finds Mr. Nicholson's 
            shovel so the group leader can dig himself out, and moves on. Mr. 
            Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the next 45 minutes, except 
            for the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working to 
            free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. The 
            guides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashing 
            lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons, 
            like shouts from the grave.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple follows the rules of avalanche 
            rescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she 
            is breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before moving 
            on to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselves 
            out.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once free, the numb and distraught 
            living do their best to help. Taylor Carcasole is frantic. His best 
            friend Michael Shaw is missing. &quot;Where's Michael? Where's Michael?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victims are scattered beneath the 
            snow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible. 
            The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go on 
            to rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grim lottery of who shall live 
            and who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour after the avalanche, seven 
            helicopters, three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site. 
            By 1:30 p.m., the final victim has been dug out. One survivor, with 
            a broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remaining 
            survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park 
            warden's station. The bodies go, too. They are laid out on mats in 
            a makeshift morgue in the same building.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-time 
            coroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within 
            two weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of major 
            injury. They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bodies are wrapped in blankets, 
            put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel. 
            Co-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies because 
            he thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in Calgary, news of the tragedy 
            begins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by late 
            afternoon.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna and Dave Broshko are just leaving 
            for evening mass when Strathcona-Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun calls 
            to tell them there's been an accident. He says there are fatalities. 
            He doesn't say who has died.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Broshko immediately phones Ben 
            Albert's mother, Carol Neale. Ben and Scott have been classmates since 
            elementary school. &quot;Carol, have you heard? There's been an accident.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What are you talking about? No!&quot; 
            she screams. &quot;I told him I didn't want him to go . . . I didn't 
            want him to go.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Arato home, Peter, skiing that 
            weekend at Big White in Kelowna, B.C., is talking to his wife when 
            her cell-phone rings. A friend has heard news reports of a tragedy 
            where their son Daniel was skiing. Mr. Arato soon learns from the 
            radio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks, where his boy's 
            school is. He thinks the odds will not be in his favour.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parents are told to go to the school. 
            Judith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone. She calls Peter in 
            hysterics. Daniel is dead. Mr. Arato's friends charter a plane and 
            send him home.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol Neale's worst fears are confirmed 
            the moment she arrives at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. As she steps inside 
            the foyer, another mother stops her. &quot;I've heard from my son,&quot; 
            she tells Ms. Neale, relief written all over her face.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I haven't heard from my son,&quot; 
            replies Ms. Neale. Minutes later, Tony Macoun tells her why. Ben is 
            dead.<br>

            Mrs. Broshko, meanwhile, is panic-stricken, a horrible sinking feeling 
            in the pit of her stomach. She can't stand not knowing. She phones 
            the RCMP in Revelstoke. No luck. She phones Glacier Park Lodge, begging 
            a clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see if 
            her Scotty is alive.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh, please, please, please, go across 
            the road for me. I will be forever in your debt. Tell me that my son 
            is there.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman agrees. She phones back. 
            No one will tell her anything.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the anguished couple head 
            for the school. They are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun. &quot;It's 
            such a tragedy,&quot; he begins.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't want to hear about the tragedy. 
            Just tell me about Scott,&quot; Mrs. Broshko says.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Macoun says: &quot;I'm very sorry. 
            Scott's gone.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Donna Broshko sleeps with a 
            picture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school's 
            formal Christmas dance. He is wearing his dad's suit and tie. His 
            father wore the same suit and tie at Scott's funeral on Thursday.<br>

            Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where last 
            week's avalanche claimed its bright young victims. They ask offhandedly 
            about &quot;the morgue,&quot; worried that the jagged debris may be 
            tricky to cross.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath, 
            with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow. Names of the dead 15-year-olds 
            -- Jeff Trickett, Scott Broshko, Daniel Arato, Ben Albert, Marissa 
            Staddon, Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath, 
            with the epigraph &quot;Your Youth Will Be Eternal.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farther along the path one glimpses 
            a more somber memorial: the deadly toe of the avalanche. At the bottom 
            of the valley are three pits. They are several meters deep, a meter 
            across, and not far apart. Three burial holes left behind, and no 
            one has filled them in.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
            Saturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir 
            School south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up the 
            Balu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., they 
            were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is the 
            sequence of events on that day.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong> Before departing, the leaders checked with the 
            National Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advised 
            that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and 
            considerable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanche 
            beacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. Wheeler 
            Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center, where they 
            conducted at least one test for avalanche risk.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. 10:15 a.m.:</strong> Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass 
            trail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the other 
            adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metres 
            from each other.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>3. 11:45 a.m.:</strong> About halfway up the valley, an avalanche 
            slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiers 
            about 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted 
            wardens by satellite phone. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>12:30 p.m.:</strong> Six students were reported alive.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>12:45 p.m.:</strong> Wardens arrive.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>4. 1:30 p.m.:</strong> All students were accounted for, including 
            the seven who lost their lives.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>1.45 p.m.:</strong> One of the students was tobogganed back 
            to the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined the 
            rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from where 
            they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.</font></p>

            A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, above 
            the south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge second 
            slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it 
            rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down 
            the valley, burying the group of skiers.</font></p>
