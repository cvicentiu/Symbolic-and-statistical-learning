<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>It’s
been the worst season for avalanche deaths in over 20 years. But those
numbers do little to console a community that was hit especially hard.
The students of Calgary’s Strathcona Tweedsmuir were on a school trip in
the mountains of B.C. It was a character building adventure trip - one
that ended in a horrific tragedy. Seven of those children never returned
from that trip and today we talk to one of the victim’s families. A remarkable
girl who led a remarkable life. Meet Marissa Staddon&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>These
are of Marissa in her early days.&nbsp; I think Karl&nbsp; took this one
when she was just a couple days old.&nbsp; And that’s her one-year-old
photo.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
is a picture of Marissa taken at the beginning of school for grade 10.&nbsp;
She looks you straight in the eye from whatever angle you’re looking at
this photograph.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Marissa
started skating at three years of age.&nbsp; She loved it.&nbsp; She had
great capacity and natural ability for it.&nbsp; And a year ago was sort
of the highlight of her skating time in that she did manage to go to Canadian
junior national competition.&nbsp; She glowed when she was on the ice&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
is Marissa with her younger sister, Brittany, who she loved and adored.
We had a lot of great times as family together.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is in
the mountains.&nbsp; We started when they were very young taking trips
to the mountains.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>(few
more family vacation photos )</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>We
went up Heart Mountain which is just east of Canmore, by Lacktah’s Arch.&nbsp;
Marissa was ten years of age at that time.&nbsp; I think it’s 2,500 feet
of net vertical.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Here
she is at the top.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Memories
of the mountains, and a mountain that forever changed this family.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Headlines
// the helicopter // the mountains in black and white</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Now
the memories of mountains are very different.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
was Marissa’s backpack that she took on the outdoor education trip where
she was struck by the avalanche.&nbsp; It was purchased new, this year,
and fitted to her.&nbsp; She was still wearing it when she was buried.&nbsp;
She was buried about two and a half metres below the surface wearing the
backpack.&nbsp; Tough going through it.&nbsp; I will show you some of the
articles that she had in that backpack on the day she was struck.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Karl
and Donna Staddon have found themselves unpacking a storm of grief since
their daughter Marissa’s school, Stratchona Tweedsmuir, had it’s outdoor
education trip turned to tragedy.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>At
the time when we hear the news that Marissa was deceased, Brittany’s response
at that time was oh, I’ve lost my very best friend and she said Marissa
has taught me so much and I was looking forward to having her teach me
more and more, I’m gonna miss her so.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then she paused and
a few minutes later Brittany spoke up and she said, well, wouldn’t you
know, Marissa was always such a competitor, and always looking to go for
the gold, and here she’s won this race, she’s beat us all to heaven.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Seven
students, all 15 years old, died in the avalanche and sent their home city,
Calgary, reeling.&nbsp; It hits not just parents, it hits siblings.&nbsp;
I mean this covers every relationship group, siblings, friends, parents,
grandparents, everybody felt a sense of loss.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Licia
Corbella is an editor at the Calgary Sun.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>You
know that I don’t want to use a clich&eacute;, but it was an avalanche
of grief.&nbsp; First there was the shuttle astronauts that perished.&nbsp;
And then later that day there was another group of 7 bright lights just
disappeared.&nbsp; And being that they were young people, and such connected
young people, so involved in so many things, it didn’t seem that there
was any person in this city who didn’t know someone who knew someone who
knew them.&nbsp; Or who knew them personally.&nbsp; Everybody just got
that sick sense in their feeling of so much potential lost.&nbsp; There
was a deep sense of sombreness in the city.&nbsp; It really made the whole
city seem smaller in an odd sense.&nbsp; Like a village.&nbsp; Because
everybody was connected in some way.&nbsp; It was very…well anytime young
people die, but to have 7 at the same time all 15 years old, all grade
10 students, all of them remarkable young people with so much promise,
it was just shocking.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>It’s
been Canada’s worst season for avalanche deaths.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>A mild
winter created the most unstable snow pack Revelstoke had seen in thirty
years.&nbsp; A reality that claimed 14 lives in 14 days.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
is an avalanche transceiver.&nbsp; All of the students and the adults on
the trip would have been wearing one of these.&nbsp; You put these around
your waist and over your shoulder to keep them secure.&nbsp; When the…this
is kind of like a key when its engaged in this, you can see, it starts
to blink.&nbsp; The number of blinks gives you a indication of the battery
life.&nbsp; And you travel with it in transmit mode.&nbsp; And it sends
out about every second a small radio frequency.&nbsp; And in the event
of an avalanche everyone who is above ground or above snow, then switches
their transceiver from transmit to receive.&nbsp; And you then go about
trying to locate with this the people that are buried.&nbsp;&nbsp; go down
to confirm exactly where they’re at.&nbsp; Because you don’t want to dig
a deep hole to find out that you dug three feet off of where they’re located.&nbsp;
So this is how they are used.&nbsp; And how some of the students were detected
and saved as a result, by the transceiver.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>That
day in Revelstoke it wasn’t human activity that began the avalanche, it
was wind.&nbsp; Over a kilometre long crack in the snow loosening itself
from the mountain.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Experienced
in wilderness trips, the Staddons have gone over all the details of this
tragedy&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>We
viewed Marissa’s body at the funeral home and she looked very much at peace,
and at rest it gave us a certain measure of comfort that the avalanche
itself hadn’t caused he a lot of pain, from what we understand and having
flown over the site later that day, she wasn’t swept through trees, she
wasn’t swept over cliffs, but she was swept a long distance 4-500 metres
we’re told from the point she was standing at or skiing at the time she
was struck by the avalanche, our firm belief is that while she was probably
very frightened undoubtedly, that she didn’t suffer a lot of pain, in the
aftermath of the avalanche.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>So
we drove up to Roger’s pass and Donna, Brittany and myself together with
Jordy Sheppard who was the Parks Canada incident scene commander and the
helicopter pilot we flew over the scene for 20 or 25 minutes.&nbsp; While
we were over the scene and it will help us you know go back and locate
the site pretty precisely where Marissa came to rest after the avalanche
.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Could
you see it from the air?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Absolutely,
it was a huge hole, I mean most of the holes were huge.&nbsp; Marissa was
buried we’re told 2 metres down and so they dug out a big pit to reach
out her body&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>My
understanding is that uh at the time of the avalanche the trip leader was
buried save except for his hand which was above the snow, we spoke with
him the morning after the avalanche, he said that he could feel himself
blacking out so time was getting away from him as well and Rich and Abby
being first on scene saw the hand and were able to scoop down to his face
and restore his breathing...7 helicopters were brought to bear over the
scene in very short order there were 35 professionals on the ground involved
in the location digging and in attempted revival efforts and the kids dug
as well... the kids dug as well because there was a time lag between the
time that the satellite phone call went out and the time Parks Canada arrived.&nbsp;
Further up the mountain where the avalanche started and you can see how
much snow really fed into this avalanche my estimate and I’ve also read
that Parks Canada I believe have said they estimate in the thousands of
tons of snow that came down Parks Canada personnel have also commented
uh think in terms of speeds of 160-200 km an hour.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>I believe
I’m told and I can’t recall whether it was 37 or 47 shovels were broken
by the rescuers in trying to dig and extricate those that were buried by
the avalanche so again it speaks volumes to the effort, the Herculean effort
of the rescuers to try to dig these kids out and revive them</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Marissa
always had a disposable camera in her back pack so she could take pictures
of her adventures, and when we got her back pack back, her camera was there
and so we took it in and had the film developed, and there’s a photo here
that would’ve been taken the day before, so on the Friday afternoon when
they were out skiing and it’s Marissa with the two other girls that were
part of the group, friends of hers and, and it just captures them with
great smiles, and just enjoying their adventure&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>So
are you at peace that the school had done everything it could that this
was not beyond acceptable ?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Yes
I am, and the reason is that I have climbed for over 20 yrs, I’ve taken
advanced avalanche training I’ve climbed in these sorts of conditions,
I had the privilege of travelling with this group of students together
with the trip leader in the fall of 2002 and nothing came to light in all
of our discussion on sun Feb 2nd with all of the personnel or subsequent
to that date that has made me think that there was an error in human decision
making.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>I really
think it’s remarkable that the first person dug out had the satellite phone.&nbsp;
It’s also incredibly remarkable that Rich and Abby, husband and wife, Rich
Marshall and Abby Watkins uh were just ahead, had passed the school group,
and had just missed it, were able to come back and be the first persons
on scene after the avalanche and if not for their efforts the consequences
would’ve been considerably worse then they are&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Karl,
as I’m looking at the gear that she all had, and I’m thinking about this
trip as it was about building character, helping students learn how to
conquer challenges explain to us what you think goes on in the psyche of
a person as they learn to conquer nature?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>I can
speak from my own experience and I think most of the students if not all
of the students were having similar experiences themselves.&nbsp; It’s
great for building confidence, it teaches you to prioritize, weight is
always an issue, the backpacks teaches you to be aware of the environment
that you’re operating in.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>These
are transferrable life skills that you learn in the mountains.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Absolutely,
you develop a mind set of how you want to deal with risk and there’s also
for me and for most of these students that there’s a sense of joyousness
of being in the mountains, you simply see things in the mountains that
you do not see in the cities.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
is the sleeping bag that Marissa took, it’s one that I’ve had for many
years, but is more than adequate for the purposes of this trip.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>......when
we return...</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Unpacking
what Marissa held in her heart.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Part
2&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>All
the Calgary teenagers lost in the avalanche were seen as incredible young
Canadians, and Marissa Staddon lived life large.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>And
her friends were such a big part of her life.&nbsp; They were a very close
knit group.&nbsp; They had fun together.&nbsp; Studied together. And they
grew in Christ together.&nbsp; They are a group of friends who keep each
other accountable.&nbsp; That was just so comforting as parents to know
that the friends your daughter had were supporting and building, helping
her to build her relationship with Christ.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Marissa
was an avid athlete, not only in figure skating, but also with school sports,
team sports.&nbsp; Mainly volleyball, badminton, and track and field.&nbsp;
She loved track and field and did very well in relay and long distance.&nbsp;
And this particular photo was taken in June of 2002, her grade 9 year.&nbsp;
Her friend gave us this photo.&nbsp; And on it he wrote, on track for the
Lord.&nbsp; And I just thought that was so wonderful.&nbsp; Because that
was indeed Marissa.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Marissa
played piano.&nbsp; Started taking lessons when she was 7 years old.&nbsp;
She was currently working on her grade 10 her grade 10 level of piano.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>She
also played flute and clarinet and saxophone and also hand bells.&nbsp;
She used her music for relaxation.&nbsp; And then she would go of to skating
in the evening she went to the arena for two hours of skating each evening</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>I love
this photo…Marissa went on last year with her graduation grade 9 class
from Glenmore Christian Academy in July to Mexico with Youth With A Mission.&nbsp;
They&nbsp; built a home for a needy family down there.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
picture was taken of Marissa on conjunction with her graduation of junior
high in June of 2002.&nbsp; Its actually the dress she had on for the funeral
as well.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>How
did you decide that?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Actually
I talked with Brittany, Marissa’s sister, and I said what dress do you
think.&nbsp; And she said, oh mom, her graduation dress.&nbsp; She loved
that.&nbsp; I can remember her putting it on and swirling around and going,
ah this feels good.&nbsp; Because both Brittany and I remember so well
her joy with that we just decided that that would be the dress we would
have for her funeral.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>For
her ultimate graduation.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>For
her ultimate graduation.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>We
just knew it had to be a celebration, and we also wanted to have the plan
of salvation to be spoken that word to be given to all who were going to
be there because Marissa lived her life solid in Christ and she was always
happy to share with others about Christ, the difference that was in her
life and so we wanted the message of salvation.”&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>(Celebration
Service clip -Pastor Matheson)&nbsp;&nbsp; “God so loved you Marissa.&nbsp;
God so loved you.&nbsp; That he gave his only Son Jesus.&nbsp; That Marissa
that you might not perish.&nbsp; So that you may have everlasting life.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Marissa
accepted Christ into her heart when she was 4 years old, it was one day
when I had picked her up from pre-school, she attended a pre-school at
a local church and when I picked her up and put her into the van, she said,
Mom, I asked Jesus into my heart today. And I said ‘Oh Marissa, I am sooo
happy for you’.&nbsp; Marissa did go on being keenly attuned to things
of the Lord, reading her Bible, praying everyday, even through her teen
years, her Bible was always at her bed side, and she read every night before
she went to sleep.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Celebration
Service Clip</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Where
would you be without Him on this one?&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Despair.&nbsp;
I think it would be despair, but when when we hold onto God, he understands
our pain, he understands our loss, he understands our confusion we sometimes
feel about all this too, but, uh there is not despair, what we have is
hope, because um know that God will give us the strength to carry on, and
that we have the hope and the promise that we will be with Marissa again
in heaven because we have asked Christ into our heart, we have that commitment,
we have that assurance that we will be in heaven with God one day and that
means that we’re gonna be in heaven with Marissa too. And that,&nbsp; just
puts a whole different turn on the grieving that we are going through on
this journey because of the hope, the wonderful hope that he’s given us.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>And
when you made your farewell card for Marissa, Karl you wrote it differently
than most people, can you tell us why?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>The
we uh look at some other precedent’s, maybe four or five, and most of the
other precedents, were people who had lived to be maybe 75 or 80 or 85,
Marissa only lived to15, and I thought that was such a pathetically short
amount small number and so I calculated the number of days including leap
years; it was 5712 days, that sounds like a lot, a lot better number&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>So
what we wrote in our card was born June 13th 1987, Heaven bound Feb1st
2003 Precious days 5712 and they truly were very very special days, we
think around Marissa, and donna and I were talking, and you know I guess
there’s a couple things, one is two scenarios, one is we never had Marissa
and the other is we had Marissa for that number of days, which would you
rather have? No choice, absolutely would take those 5712 days with Marissa
the second question, was Marissa ours, or was Marissa God’s gift to us
for whatever reason, and trusted to us to raise her up and it’s the later,
she was God’s gift.&nbsp;</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Youth
pastor Eryn Moore:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s no guarantees in life in terms
of how long we’ll actually live.&nbsp; And I think that really caught a
lot of our students off guard.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot them really struggled
with it at first.&nbsp; There was some anger, there was some questioning
about why God would allow something like this to happen.&nbsp; Sometimes
I think the best answer is no answer.&nbsp; I’ve seen God work through
this tragedy in amazing ways, but I couldn’t say to these students, “God
allowed Marissa to die so that these could happen.” I don’t know if that
was totally His will.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that our lives
are short.&nbsp;&nbsp; That God never promises us any time of life on earth.&nbsp;
Life is a gift.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>This
is an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight.&nbsp; It’s
a poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they would
like, and they have to write poems.&nbsp; Marissa chose the theme of God.&nbsp;
When her sister, when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read it
through we realised how…how wonderful this was for us to have now.&nbsp;
To have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart.&nbsp; And they reflected
her closeness with God.&nbsp; Her walk, her journey with God.&nbsp;</font></font></font>

have a favourite in here, tell us why.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>Yes
I do have a favourite.&nbsp; The favourite that I have is this free verse
which is called A Fresh Start.&nbsp; Would it be all right if I read it.&nbsp;
“Sadly, standing in shimmering, sprinkling snow.&nbsp; Shoulders down.&nbsp;
Face downward.&nbsp; Emotionally down cast.&nbsp; She ponders, wonders,
cries.&nbsp; Tears walking round her face.&nbsp; Covering all in their
course, overcoming the sink before them.&nbsp; Why is she alone?&nbsp;
Why out in the snow?&nbsp; Out in the cold?&nbsp; Kneeling.&nbsp; Bowing.&nbsp;
Stumbling.&nbsp; Fallen in the frost.&nbsp; Hands grasp.&nbsp; Eyes closed.&nbsp;
Heart welcoming.&nbsp; She finds a Redeemer.&nbsp; A Saviour.&nbsp; A fresh
start.”&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>I reflect
more on it through the lens of the avalanche.&nbsp; I don’t know that its
prophecy but the parallels here are incredible.&nbsp; Absolutely incredible.&nbsp;
It touches me every time we look at it.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>You
had a very unique way of letting Marissa say goodbye to her friends, it
was on a CD that she recorded, tell us about that.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#454B74"><font size=-1>‘Well
in December of 2000 Marissa decided she wanted to put a compilation of
music together of contemporary Christian music and I encouraged her&nbsp;
that I think it would be good to have a lead in voice section.&nbsp; It
was appropriate for the CD in Dec. 2000 and it was entirely appropriate
for her funeral service, her celebration service .... “</font></font></font>
