              Against Recent Yellowstone Decision</strong><br>
              <br>
              More than 100 Protest Court Ruling Overturning Parks&#8217; Snowmobile 
              Ban<br>
              <br>
              West Yellowstone, Montana &#8211; More than 100 skiers from around 
              the nation gathered in Yellowstone National Park to speak out against 
              Tuesday&#8217;s federal court ruling that again allows snowmobile 
              use in the park.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&#8220;We must preserve this park now, before it&#8217;s 
              too late,&#8221; said Haidee Wilson from North Carolina. &#8220;This 
              park is a national, possibly even an international gem, and we must 
              do what we can to ensure that future generations can visit Yellowstone 
              in its original state.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The rally, hosted by Winter Wildlands Alliance (WWA) 
              took place just inside the park&#8217;s West Gate, which is now 
              the entryway for up to 440 snowmobiles per day. On Tuesday, U.S. 
              District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining order 
              that suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone and 
              Grand Teton national parks. Brimmer ruled that without the order, 
              companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparable 
              harm because of lost business.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&#8220;I&#8217;m upset that [Brimmer&#8217;s] decision 
              completely ignores us skiers and snowshoers,&#8221; said Mack Bray 
              from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. &#8220;We stay in hotels, eat in restaurants, 
              and have money that is as green as anyone else&#8217;s. But we can&#8217;t 
              recreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise. Without 
              a ban, there&#8217;s just no point in us coming here.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">A Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet 
              Sullivan reinstated a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobile use 
              in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The effect of the 
              court&#8217;s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use in 
              the parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Many residents of the Park&#8217;s gateway community 
              of West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec. 16 ruling would 
              reduce winter tourism dollars. WWA&#8217;s event was to be an attempt 
              at re-introducing human-powered winter recreationists to the park. 
              Many skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter because 
              it was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Winter Wildlands expects the long-term effect of 
              a snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourism 
              dollars as more user-groups flock to a safer, quieter, more pristine 
              Yellowstone, while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than 
              1,000 miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park. WWA officials 
              estimated that the 105 attendees of their celebration pumped more 
              than $40,000 into local economies.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&#8220;Skiers and snowshoers have told us they&#8217;re 
              ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we&#8217;re 
              confident they&#8217;ll play a key role in expanding the community&#8217;s 
              tourism base, once snowmobile use is banned from our parks,&#8221; 
              said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">With a complete phase-out of snowmobiles still scheduled 
              for next winter, Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service, 
              Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and recreation 
              organizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw more 
              winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities. 
              Winter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstone 
              snowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diverse 
              winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Based in Boise, Idaho, Winter Wildlands represents 
              more than 19 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and other 
              non-motorized snowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreation 
              group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National 
              Park Service&#8217;s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton 
              national parks.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><strong>2/13/04 - Skiers Say Court Setback Underscores 
              Need for Yellowstone Rally</strong><br>
              300 Expected in Park for Valentine&acirc;&euro;&#8482;s Day Show 
              of Support for Yellowstone<br>
              WEST YELLOWSTONE, MT - Fresh from a U.S. District Court ruling that 
              suddenly and dramatically increased the number of snowmobiles allowed 
              in Yellowstone National Park the rest of this winter, skiers and 
              other winter recreationists are coming to Yellowstone this weekend 
              to rally in support of the park and re-assert their demand to eliminate 
              the machines from the park.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The ruling in Wyoming is a huge disappointment, 
              especially since four federal judges in Washington, D.C., soundly 
              rejected the governments push to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone, 
              Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes said. 
              But this setback only underscores the need for skiers, snowshoers 
              and other non-motorized snowsports enthusiasts from around the nation 
              to rally once again in Yellowstone in support of the park and all 
              it represents. The fight for a clean, healthy, and quiet Yellowstone 
              is far from over and we are more energized than ever.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">As it did last Presidents Day weekend, Winter Wildlands 
              Alliance is inviting members and supporters from across the United 
              States to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice their 
              support for the park. An estimated 300 supporters are expected to 
              attend both a Friday night pre-rally reception and the main event 
              on Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The rally comes just four days after U.S. District 
              Court Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase-out of 
              snowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of the 
              snowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming. The snowmobile industry 
              and the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despite 
              National Park Service studies that show the way to best protect 
              the park is to ban the machines. Winter Wildlands joined five national 
              and regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting to 
              restore the three-year-old snowmobile phase-out launched by the 
              Clinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House. U.S. 
              District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with the 
              coalition in December, overturning the Bush administration plan 
              to allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Service 
              to begin the phase-out. That ruling was later upheld by an appellate 
              panel. But this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase-out, prompting 
              the Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machines 
              into the park than allowed so far this winter.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The Park Services answer to this controversy is 
              no answer at all, Grimes said. It is now allowing 780 machines into 
              Yellowstone, up from the 493 that were allowed before this ruling. 
              Those who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazed 
              at how much quieter and cleaner it is this year. Now, we are back 
              to business as usual. Yellowstone will be louder, dirtier, and less 
              healthy this weekend than it was last weekend.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">This is Americas park, and Americans have spoken 
              overwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Service 
              says is needed to protect Yellowstone. Instead of looking for ways 
              to get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone, we should be focusing 
              on finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the park 
              on snowcoaches, just as the Park Service suggested three years and 
              millions of dollars worth of studies ago.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">During the course of this weekend, Winter Wildlands 
              will be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble efforts 
              to contact their elected officials in Washington and to step up 
              lobbying on behalf of a snowmobile-free Yellowstone.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Winter Wildlands has joined such groups as The Wilderness 
              Society, National Parks Conservation Association, Greater Yellowstone 
              Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and 
              the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in campaigning to remove 
              snowmobiles from the two parks, as recommended by the Park Service 
              in 2000, before the Park Service reversed itself after being sued 
              by the snowmobile industry.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">With thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trails 
              surrounding Yellowstone, there are ample opportunities for snowmobilers 
              to enjoy their sport without harming the park and ruining the visitor 
              experience. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Founded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughout 
              the country, Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization 
              working to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience.

              Touching the Void Opens Today </b><br>
              Not long ago I asked a friend who climbs mountains for a living 
              to name his favorite climbing movies. He paused. "Man, they're all 
              so awful," he said. "It'd be easier to give you a list that started 
              at bad and went down to very, very bad." . </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">When movies meet mountains, bad cinema results. 
              Consider "Vertical Limit" (2000), which finds mountaineering so 
              dull that it adds nitroglycerin to the mix. Or "Cliffhanger" (1993), 
              the Sylvester Stallone vehicle propelled by evildoers and stolen 
              loot. The 1997 television adaptation of Jon Krakauer's Everest book, 
              "Into Thin Air," proved so unwatchable that the rescued climbers 
              probably outnumbered the audience by the end. . To read the complete

              - Ice Climbing Event 2004, Argentiere </b><br>
              The 14th Ice Climbing Event got off to a cold start in France's 
              Argentiere - La Bessee yesterday morning. The famous Fournel international 
              meeting, which continues until the 11th of January, attracts up 
              to 800 climbers from 30 different countries and is therefore rightly

              and further afield. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">As ever, participants are transported by mini-buses 
              to the 300+ icefalls in the morning, while the afternoon programs 
              within the ICEPO village include workshops, gear tests, a selection

              Tower Dubai</b><br>
              By Jay B. Hilotin, Staff Reporter<br>
              Alain Roberts, the French Spiderman, will scale one of the six high-rises 
              in Dubai Marina later this month as part of the Dubai Shopping Festival 
              spectacle. Roberts will attempt free-climbing the Murjan Tower (200 
              metres, including spires) on January 29. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Last year, Roberts caused a stir in Abu Dhabi when 
              he climbed the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters, drawing 
              an estimated 100,000 spectators. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The newly-minted Murjan Tower at Dubai Marina will 
              be an addition to Roberts' portfolio of over 60 skyscrapers and 
              landmarks worldwide, including Malaysia's Petronas Towers, the Eiffel 
              Tower, the Empire State Building, and the straight-faced, glass-fronted 
              Sears Tower in Chicago. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Roberts spent six days in a Tokyo jail after police 
              apprehended him for climbing the 225-metre Shinjuku Tower without 
              a rope, which horrified the Japanese police and fire brigade. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">He was originally sentenced to between two and six 
              months in jail but a TV channel caught a cop on TV punching Roberts 
              in the face. "It was not that bad, the punch," recalled the Spiderman. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">But Emaar Properties, developers of Dubai Marina, 
              have welcomed Roberts to climb one of its signature properties along 
              Sheikh Zayed Road. Mansour Al Othaimin, corporate director of Emaar 
              Properties, said: "Roberts brings a message of courage to Dubai 
              and is a great inspiration for us all. Emaar instantly recognised 
              his dedication to achieve excellence, something that we can constantly 
              strive for in providing quality homes to the community." </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The Dubai Marina, situated next to the Dubai Media 
              City and the Internet City, is a self-contained community carved 
              out of the desert edge with a 3.5 kilometre free-flowing canal that 
              was later flooded with sea water.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"> It is strategically located by Interchange 5, right 
              next to the beach-front signature buildings such as the majestic 
              Burj Al Arab and postcard perfect Jumeirah Beach Hotel. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Emaar is one of the key sponsors of DSF 2004, which 
              starts in seven days. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Saeed Al Nabouda, CEO of the Dubai Shopping Festival, 
              said: "There is no doubt that Emaar's participation in DSF will 
              add more value. They will be presenting many activities that can 
              be enjoyed by all members of every family of different nationalities." 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Roberts said climbing is his passion. He suffers 
              from vertigo, and his accidents have partly disabled him. But he 
              has become the world's top solo climber. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">As a skilled motivational speaker, Roberts brings 
              a message of hope and inspiration to Dubai. "We set our limits, 
              but we are all strong enough to aim higher, to achieve our goals. 
              All we have to do is find such strength within ourselves and know 
              how to develop it." <a href="http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=107430" target="_blank">http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=107430</a></font></p>

              Cope With Snowmobile Rule </b><br>
              Judge's ruling on park sleds presents new opportunity to expand 
              winter economies. <br>
              BOISE, ID - A federal court ruling against the Bush administration's 
              snowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short-term 
              hardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone, but will be a 
              boon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such as 
              West Yellowstone to diversify their economies, the nation's first 
              and only organization representing non-motorized winter recreationists 
              said. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&quot;We understand there will be some local economic 
              disruption as a result of this ruling, but we also know skiers and 
              other winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone and 
              its gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park,&quot; 
              said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes. 
              &quot;Skiers have been telling us they're ready to return to places 
              like West Yellowstone, and we're confident they'll play a key role 
              as the community expands its tourism base.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Winter Wildlands, based in Boise, represents more 
              than 17 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and other non-motorized 
              snowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreation group among the 
              six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service's 
              winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. 
              U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set aside 
              the Park Service's plan to allow nearly 1,000 snowmobiles a day 
              into Yellowstone and Grand Teton, reinstating a Clinton-era plan 
              to phase out snowmobile use in both parks. The effect of the court's 
              ruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half, 
              eliminating it next year.</font></p>
            <p> <font size="2">&quot;The important thing for Yellowstone and for 
              those who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to move 
              ahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with more 
              snowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter,&quot; 
              Grimes said. &quot;Yellowstone is not closed this winter, nor will 
              it be closed next winter. All Americans will still enjoy access 
              to this special place. Now that the court has ruled, it's up to 
              all of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surrounding 
              these magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunities 
              in and around the parks.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Grimes said it's critical that the Park Service, 
              Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and snowmobile 
              organizations work together to find new ways to draw more winter 
              visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities. That 
              includes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstone 
              snowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winter 
              recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. For instance, 
              the Park Service was prepared to spend more than $1 million in tax 
              dollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and other 
              impacts, and to hire more law enforcement officers. That money can 
              now be used to expand local economies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&quot;The visiting public needs to be made aware 
              that tomorrow, next week, and throughout the winter they can continue 
              to visit Yellowstone's popular attractions,&quot; Grimes said. &quot;Skiers 
              and snowshoers will return, and we think this can be a win-win case 
              for everyone. It's our hope that rather than being known as just 
              the 'snowmobile capitol of the world,' towns like West Yellowstone 
              will become known as the 'Winter Wonderland of the world.'&quot; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Other groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobile 
              case are: Greater Yellowstone Coalition, National Parks Conservation 
              Association, The Wilderness Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, 
              and Sierra Club. The organizations were represented by Earthjustice. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Grimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annual 
              skier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine's Day. WWA 
              expects more than 300 skiers, snowshoers, and others to fill West 
              Yellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents' Day 
              weekend, as they did last year, in a show of economic support for 
              local businesses. WWA officials will also seek to meet with local 
              business leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding the 
              town's winter economy. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Founded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughout 
              the country, Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization 
              working to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience.

              climbing area in New York. The event took place over the weekend 
              of October 3-5, 2003, and featured a climbing competition to benefit 
              the Access Fund, a film premier of Pilgrimage featuring Chris Sharma, 
              a film presentation highlighting the biodiversity of the Mohonk 
              Preserve, a community clean-up service project, and a synergy of 
              local and international climbers. Roc Trip drew over 400 climbers 
              for an open-levels bouldering competition that raised over $10,000 
              for the Access Fund. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Hank Alicandri, head ranger for the Mohonk Preserve, 
              felt the event successfully reached climbers with a community message. 
              "Roc Trip was a great opportunity to speak to an audience made up 
              primarily of boulderers about important impact issues surrounding 
              their sport," said Alicandri. At Saturday's clean up, athletes from 
              France and North America worked side-by-side with Petzl staff, removing 
              several truckloads of trash from the climbing and overlook parking 
              areas. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sunday's climbing competition was organized into 
              three teams, pitting local climbers, European climbers, and North 
              American sponsored athletes against one another for the Access Fund 
              Benefit. Based on point system that converted climbing points into 
              benefit dollars, 316 locals prevailed on their home turf, raising 
              $4,850, trailed by the Euro team of 11 raising $3,118 and the Americans 
              finishing third and contributing $2,275. The overall winner was 
              Petzl UK team athlete Steve McClure, with an individual score of 
              695 points. Locals Rich Romano and Felix Mondugo each racked up 
              315 points, and Ally Dory was the winner among local women, scoring 
              a total of 106 points. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">"It's great to see over 400 people getting out there 
              climbing and earning dollars for the Access Fund," said John DiCuollo, 
              Petzl's Roc Trip coordinator. "Roc Trip is intended as a gathering 
              of international climbers, and this year's event proves that it's 
              not about how hard you climb, it's about community". </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Some notably difficult ascents took place at Roc 
              Trip, with Dave Graham putting up a new start to Euphoria , the 
              first V12 bouldering problem at the Gunks, and British climber Steve 
              McClure on-sighting (leading the climb without falling) Survival 
              of the Fittest, a 5.13 traditional route climbed on natural protection. 
              McClure also ascended Double Clutch with an extra degree of difficulty, 
              by adding a sit-start upping the grade to V11. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">For festivities, local climber and filmmaker Josh 
              Lowell presented Pilgrimage, featuring Chris Sharma's bouldering 
              journey to Hampi, India. On Saturday night, Tim O'Neill, the "Clown 
              Prince of Climbing", entertained an energetic crowd with his comedic 
              performance and a screening of "Climbing for Peas", followed by 
              an after party attended by over 400 climbers. Rich Gottlieb, owner 
              of the local Rock & Snow climbing shop, was one of the local sponsors 
              this year's Roc Trip. Rock & Snow had a record weekend in sales, 
              and as a result, Gottlieb is donating an additional $1,000 to the 
              Access Fund. "This event generated a type of energy that empowered 
              everyone to realize that they could do better, whether it's through 
              climbing or in helping out the community," said Gottlieb. "This 
              event was, and felt, incredibly non-commercial. It's great that 
              Petzl is more focused on the community and the climbing than on 
              profiting from this gathering."</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"> In addition to the $10,000 for the Access Fund, 
              Petzl and Rock and Snow contributed $4000 in cash and rescue equipment 
              to the Mohonk Preserve. <font color="#000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://www.AccessFund.org" target="_blank">AccessFund.org</a></font></font></font></p>

              SITES'</b><br>
              In keeping with its policy of fast-tracking oil and gas drilling 
              on Western lands, the Bush administration is again rushing to let 
              industrial machinery tear up Utah's redrock country, this time in 
              an area that contains more than 1,000 archaelogical sites. Even 
              among the dramatic landscapes of the redrock canyonlands, the Nine 
              Mile Canyon region stands out. It is home to irreplaceable cultural 
              and archaeological resources, including the largest concentration 
              of rock art sites in the country. Ignoring the potential for damage 
              to these historic treasures, the Bureau of Land management is preparing 
              to give a private contractor's helicopters, vibrating "thumper" 
              trucks and giant bubble-tired tractors access to the 57,500 acres 
              of federal land in the area as part of a seismic exploration project. 
              But the agency must accept public comments on the plan through October

              The <a href="http://www.accessfund.org" target="_blank">Access Fund</a> 
              held a national conference for climber-activists from September 
              11-14, 2003 at the Estes Park Center in Colorado. The event united 
              the organization's national network of regional coordinators with 
              activists from local climber organizations (LCOs) and land managers 
              for two days of workshops, discussion and networking. Participants 
              also shared strategies for preserving access and conserving the 
              climbing environment. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The Summit epitomized the Access Fund's commitment 
              to preserving access and provided an excellent forum for volunteer

              and knowledge. It was the fourth event held by the Access Fund in

              to their local climbing areas.</font></p>

              -- BLM Developing Travel Management Plan, CO</font></b><br>
              The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is developing a travel management 
              plan for off-road vehicles (ORVs) and other recreation use on 350,000 
              acres of interspersed private, state, and BLM lands between Canon 
              City and Cripple Creek. This area is known as the Gold Belt Travel 
              Management Area, and it includes the Shelf Road climbing area. Low 
              population and rugged terrain have kept most of these lands relatively 
              pristine. However, the area has recently been discovered by growing 
              numbers of off-road vehicle users. ORV advocates are well organized, 
              vocal and have been lobbying the BLM for greater access. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Intensive ORV use will have an adverse effect on 
              the Shelf climbing experience, degrade wildlife habitat and water 
              quality, and increase noise pollution and soil erosion. The BLM 
              is now in the process of deciding how much of the area will be available 
              to ORVs and how much will remain wild and provide solitude.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The BLM has held two scoping meetings (to identify 
              important issues and develop alternatives) and is now in the process 
              of developing the Travel Management Plan. Comments will be accepted 
              throughout the planning process. Please encourage the BLM to restrict 
              ORV use to existing roads, and most importantly, not to allow their 
              use in or near the Shelf Road climbing area. </font><font color="#000000" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://www.AccessFund.org" target="_self">AccessFund.org</a></font></font></p>
