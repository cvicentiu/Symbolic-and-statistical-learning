On August 12, a mere three weeks after swearing off marathon approaches, I
found myself stumbling back to the car after another long day in the
backcountry.  Chan Harrell and I had just climbed the South Arete Direct on
Angel Wings in Sequoia National Park, and, hungry and dehydrated as usual,
we were hoping to end our little adventure as soon as possible.

<p>
We had cut out of work a little early Friday to beat traffic, and arrived at
the trailhead at the unheard-of hour of 8:30 pm.  Thumbing
through the guidebook just outside the park, I rashly suggested that given
our early arrival, we should consider doing the 16 mile approach in the
dark, maybe catch a couple of hours of sleep at Hamilton Lake, and then tick
both Angel Wings and the South Buttress of Cherubim Dome, a so-called
unknown classic of the Sierra.  Chan didn't need much convincing, and it
seemed like a great plan until a more careful look at the numbers revealed a
certain epic drive home Sunday and possible missed flight for me Monday
morning (to start a trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone with Tatjana).  So it
was back to the usual--up at about 3:30am, hiking at 4, and climbing by
about 11.  The route was quite good, though a little dirty on the first few
pitches.  And lots of funk, even on the easy pitches.  We enjoyed a
cloudless sky, and the views were, as always in the Sierra, quite
spectacular.  We also enjoyed a fairly casual descent, and near-full moon
for the hike out.  The final tally was 32 miles hiking, 7070 feet elevation
gain for the day (which was a little surprising given that the net gain from
trailhead to summit was only 3500 feet, and the trail doesn't go over any
passes), with a car-to-car time of 21 hr 20 min (back in time for a few z's
before driving home!).
<p>

The following day, T and I headed out to the Tetons for a week.  We
stayed at the climber's ranch, where climber's from all over the country
hang, chat, and scheme their next ascent of the Grand (13,770 ft).  These
ascents
seem to take at least one day for the approach, one for the climb and
possibly one for the hike back out to the car.  So it turned more than few
heads at the Ranch when I soloed the Owens-Spaulding route in 8 hrs ranch to
ranch (5.4, 12-14 miles, 7000 ft elevation gain).  (Jackson locals were no
doubt more impressed with Rolando Garibrotti's solo of the entire Grand
Traverse (Teewinot, Owen, the Grand, Middle, South and possibly another
summit or two) in roughly the same time a couple days earlier).  Later, I
again stunned the ranch denizens when I did a three mile approach AND
on-sighted 5.10- while climbing Caveat Emptor, a fabulous 6 pitch route in
death canyon, all in a single day.
<p>

Other highlights in the Tetons included running into Abby Watkins on the
summit of the Grand (she's guiding for Jackson Mountain Guides this summer),
and many terrific hikes and wild animal sightings.
<p>

We spent the next five days exploring Yellowstone, again enjoying beautiful
scenery, wild geysers, hot springs, bubbling mud pools, and Visitor Center
videos of bison head-butting hapless tourists.  Exciting stuff.  The only
bummer was that we didn't see any bears, though we did see paw prints and a
total of 5 bison or elk carcasses within sight of the various trails we
hiked.
<p>

Now it's back to the usual...
<p>

Cheers,
