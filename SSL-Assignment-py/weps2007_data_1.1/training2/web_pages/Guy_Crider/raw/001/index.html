He stated ASC would like regular reports from City staff on where are we with 
resort planning.

1.	Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of the land use 
proposed, in particular, the village-like intensity of Tennis Meadows? and 
Should employee housing be incorporated into the Master plan for Tennis Meadows? 
Gondola Square?

Engelken: feels good development needs to refer to the SS Community Plan.  He 
felt the Gondola Plaza plans fits in nicely, but did not support the Tennis 
Meadows proposal.  He prefers existing in-fill area be built out, prior to 
accommodating sporadic commercial and retail land use.  Generally agreed with PC 
comments.

Stettner:  Felt Gondola Square development/enhancement was appropriate. Voiced 
concern with the Tennis Meadows plan, feel that it is not appropriate with the 
Community Plan.

Brenner: hopes to see employee housing incorporated into existing structures 
rather than having it removed.  He prefers to see focus on the Gondola Base 
area.

Connell: noted a weakness in the pedestrianization of the base area.  She 
suggested focus be in that area and supports employee housing.

Bennett: suggested ASC work with the Mtn Town Plan and DDA.  He voiced concern 
with the timing of the Tennis Meadows area being in competition with the 
pedestrianization of the base area.  Supports employee housing being integrated 
and would like to see all the development work in harmony with the airport and 
air service of the community.... noting the vitality of the community needs to 
be maintained.

2.	Are timeshare hotels and condominium hotels appropriate in Tennis Meadows 
given its distance from the base area?

Engelken: supports keeping density at base area, until there is a demonstrated 
need for dwelling units that far away from the base...if high demand, Grand 
Summit would be proceeding with Phase II.

Stettner: felt timeshares are not appropriate in the area. She voiced concern 
with the capability of infrastructure to handle the proposed build out at this 
time.  She suggested community capacity be evaluated.

Brenner: preferred in-fill at the base area, prior to construction in Tennis 
Meadows.  He was concerned with too much happening too fast.

Connell:  voiced concern with the economic vitality and viability of existing 
retail and lodging.  Consideration needs to be taken with the existing 
community...what is the future...what is the Steamboat statement...concern with 
diluting base and development with time shares.

Bennett: cannot support timeshares in Tennis Meadows.

3. What Code should apply to the developments?

CONSENSUS: Council supported the new Code being used for the proposed 
development.

11. Should a retail study be required with the conceptual plan submission?

CONSENSUS: Council stated yes.

12.	Should ASC be permitted to redevelop existing parking structures?

CONSENSUS: Council stated yes. Engelken stated all new development would need 
parking.

13.	What should the obligation for replacing those parking spaces be?

Mountain Town Plan needed to be followed in this area.

development prior to Tennis Meadows development.

reasons.

Meadows area is a ploy to obtain approval and then sell the ski area.

commercial vitality.  Supports a "go reasonable" attitude.
