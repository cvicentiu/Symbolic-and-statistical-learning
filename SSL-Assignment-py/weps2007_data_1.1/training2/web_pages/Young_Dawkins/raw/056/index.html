	<td><span class=body1>The programme is flexibly structured.  If you know you are – say – a confirmed specialist in marketing, you will probably want to choose sessions within the Marketing track But if your role is more varied, if you come from a “small shop” doing something of everything, if you are a manager who now needs to understand more than the discipline you grew up with, you may want to chart a personal course through the conference. <br><br>Below are highlights likely to be stimulating for some of the different groups attending. There are endless variants on this individual mix-and-match.<br><br>The session numbers refer to the time slot in which they take place. We ask you on the booking form to give us a preliminary indication of which sessions you expect to attend, so as to help us allocate rooms efficiently. But at the Conference you are free to change your mind, to follow the buzz about a particular speaker or to seek guidance from a mentor, colleague or CASE staff member.<br><br>Part of what’s special about this Conference is the opportunity to tune in to trends and topics operating in parallel to your role. So why not take advantage of the chance to look at the bigger picture in one or two sessions?<br><br><b>International</b> <br><UL><li>The Idea of a 21st century university, Professor Alan Gilbert, University of Melbourne, Opening plenary<br><li>From Fontainebleau to Frisco: connecting  with your alumni and reuniting friends, Andrea Buck, University College London and Joelle Du Lac, INSEAD,  Session 204AR		<br><li>Managing your International Reputation, Tim Rudd, Middlesex University, Session 301CM/MK		<br><li>Pricing and financial aid – a States side example, Michael Behnke, University of Chicago, Session 602MK<br><li>The marketisation of Australian university education, Stephen Holmes, Stephen Holmes & Associates, Session 703CM</ul><br>				<br><b>Keeping Fresh</b><br><br><UL><li>Love thy neighbour: community relations, John Baldwin, University of Hertfordshire, Session 402CM<br><li>Photography on campus (for Higher Education publications), Ian Bradshaw , Ian Bradshaw Photography Ltd, Session 603CM<br><li>Face to face asking - a guide and demonstration, Tania Jane Rawlinson, University College Oxford, Session 705FR<br><li>Creative thinking, Martin Scott, Consultant, Session 801 AR/CM/FR/MK<br><li>Exploring the digital revolution, Ian Rowley, University of Warwick, Session 902 CM</UL><br><br><b>Beginners</b> <br><br><UL><li>How to achieve eternal happiness in the advancement world, Young Dawkins, University of New Hampshire Foundation, Track Plenary 3 AR<br><li>The culture of internal communication: talk to each other as we talk to the world, Jeff Iseminger, Oxford Brookes University, Session 202CM<br><li>So you want to be a development director?, Miles Stevenson, University of Sheffield and Chris Cox, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Session 307FR<br><li>Relationship management, Nelson Armstrong, Dartmouth College, Session 405AR<br><li>Uncovering the student life experience, Tabitha Birchall, UNITE, Session 1003MK</UL><br><br><b>Managers</b> <br><UL><li>Towards 2006, Panel Discussion, Peter Slee, Mary Blair, Adrian Beney, Stephen Holmes, Session 201 AR/CM/FR/MK<br><li>Do university leaders take “reputation” and “branding” seriously?, Justin Shaw, Communications Management and Chris Chapleo, University of Surrey Roehampton, Session 401CM<br><li>Leadership, Sir George Bain, Queen's University Belfast, Session 601 AR/CM/FR/MK<br><li>Assessing campaign readiness, Vance Peterson, CASE, Session 908FR <br><li>Lobbying for the Coalition of Modern Universities, Peter Bingle, Bell Pottinger, 1002, Session 1002CM</UL><br></span></td>
