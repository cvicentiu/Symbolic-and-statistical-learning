<img src="/images/people/dougmacpherson.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
<big><strong>Doug MacPherson</strong></big>, 2001-12-11
<p><big>The University of New Hampshire has received a donation that matches the largest gift the institution has ever received.   A 1967 UNH graduate yesterday donated 10-million dollars to support its space science and developmental psychology programs.   The money is seen as critical to the university’s long-term fundraising efforts.  NHPR’s Doug MacPherson reports.</big></p>
<br><center><em><big>Below is a rough transcript. It is not word for word accurate.</big></em></center><br><big>PETER PAUL GREW UP IN TROY, NEW HAMPSHIRE.   HE GRADUATED FROM U-N-H IN 1967 WITH A DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.   PAUL, WHO NOW LIVES IN CALIFORNIA., WENT ON TO FOUND HEADLANDS MORTGAGE COMPANY, WHICH MERGED WITH ANOTHER FIRM SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN A 475-MILLION DOLLAR DEAL.    <br>
AT A CEREMONY HONORING PAUL FOR HIS 10-MILLION DOLLAR GIFT, <br>
U-N-H PRESIDENT JOAN LEITZEL NOTED THAT PAUL REFERS TO HIS DONATION AS AN INVESTMENT.   <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPE LEITZEL  356 we promise to you that your investment in the university of new hampshire will pay great returns, it will be the best of your investments of all time, and we know you set a high standard.  We intend to meet it.  thank you very much.   :16<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL’S DONATION WAS THE CULMINATION OF TWO YEARS OF TALKS WITH YOUNG DAWKINS, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF U-N-H FUNDRAISING.   PAUL GAVE A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH HE DECIDED TO ENDOW TWO NEW FACULTY CHAIRS.       <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPE PAUL First they convinced me that they could put this to use.  They had five chairs on the wish list.  And then I really came back and said, “that’s a little too big a bite, Young.”  [LAUGHTER]  I didn’t blame him for asking. [LAUGHTER]  And I said “Why don’t you pick two.”   [LAUGHTER]   :20<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DAWKINS DID JUST THAT.   THE CHAIR IN SPACE SCIENCE WILL PROVIDE SALARY AND RESEARCH FUNDING FOR A PROFESSOR TO HEAD THE UNIVERSITY’S  SPACE SCIENCES CENTER.   THE CENTER COMPETES INTERNATIONALLY  IN THE FIELDS OF PLANETARY PLASMA PHYSICS, SOLAR SYSTEM ASTROPHYSICS, AND GAMMA RAY ASTRONOMY.    <br>
THE OTHER CHAIR WILL ALLOW U-N-H TO FURTHER ITS RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY, ACCORDING TO MARILYN HOSKIN, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPE MARILYN HOSKIN  Some of the most interesting and certainly most critical areas of research is addressed to those areas, of how do you develop healthy children in an environment which is supportive?  And so, the people who do research in that area study both children at risk and children who are in good living and developing conditions.   We’re not defining one or the other because we’re looking for the best faculty member we can have in that area.  : 21<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GETTING THE BEST IS WHAT ENDOWING CHAIRS IS ALL ABOUT.   <br>
WITH THE SPACE SCIENCE CHAIR, U-N-H OFFICIALS HOPE TO ATTRACT SOMEONE OF THE STATURE OF BERRIEN MOORE, WHO DIRECTS U-N-H’S INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF EARTH, OCEANS, AND SPACE.    MOORE ATTRACTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FUNDING.   LAST YEAR, EARTH, OCEANS AND SPACE BROUGHT IN GRANTS TOTALING MORE THAN 24-MILLION DOLLARS.   45-PERCENT OF EVERY GRANT DOLLAR GOES TO FUND THE UNIVERSITY’S OVERHEAD.    <br>
THAT’S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO U-N-H, BECAUSE IN TERMS OF STATE SUPPORT – NEW HAMPSHIRE RANKS DEAD LAST AMONG THE 50-STATES.  SOME U-N-H FACULTY LIKE TO JOKE THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE RANKS JUST BEHIND GUAM AND PUERTO RICO IN THIS REGARD.    HOWEVER, YOUNG DAWKINS, U-N-H FOUNDATION PRESIDENT, NOTES THAT STATE LAWMAKERS RECENTLY APPROVED 100-MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AT U-N-H OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS.      <br>
<br>
<br>
TAPE DAWKINS   so I think it’s erroneous to say the state of nh doesn’t care and doesn’t invest in the public university, -- they do.   But it’s the public private partnership that’s going to make the real telling difference at the university of new hampshire.   And it is that public private partnership that the foundation is trying to engender and carry out.   <br>
:19   <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ABOUT 13-PERCENT OF U-N-H ALUMNI DONATE MONEY TO THE UNIVERSITY.   NATIONALLY, AMONG RESEARCH UNIVERSITY’S THE AVERAGE IS HIGHER – ABOUT 15-PERCENT.   DAWKINS WANTS TO SEE IT RISE AS HIGH AS 20-PERCENT.    AND HE BELIEVES U-N-H NEEDS TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE ITS 162-MILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT.   <br>
DAWKINS THINKS PAUL’S GIFT WILL INSPIRE MORE GIVING AT ALL LEVELS.     <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPE DAWKINS   It’s an enormous act of leadership and commitment.  And what it says to people is, “Gee, if someone who has that much money and has that much business savvy is making that kind of commitment, UNH must be a pretty good place.   :15   <br>
<br>
THE CALL FOR CANDIDATES TO FILL THE TWO NEW FACULTY CHAIRS HAS ALREADY GONE OUT.   U-N-H OFFICIALS SAY WITH PAUL’S GIFT, THEY’RE CONFIDENT THAT CAN RECRUIT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST.   THEY SAY THE PROCESS IS NOT UNLIKE RECRUITING A STAR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.    FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY TO HONOR PAUL’S DONATION, ONE SCIENCE FACULTY MEMBER PUT IT THIS WAY:   “WE’RE IN THE FINAL PHASE OF THE N-F-L DRAFT,”  HE SAID.  “AND WE’VE GOT PICK NUMBER ONE.”     FOR N-H-P-R NEWS, I’M DOUG MACPHERSON.</big><p><big><strong>URL for this story: http://www.nhpr.org/view_content/2215/</strong></big></p></div></center>
