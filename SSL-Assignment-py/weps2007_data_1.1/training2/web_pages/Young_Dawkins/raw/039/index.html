<FONT SIZE=2>                DURHAM, N.H. -- The University of New Hampshire has received a $10 million
                gift from Troy, N.H, native Peter T. Paul, a 1967 graduate in business administration.
                The gift establishes a chair in Space Science and a chair in Developmental
                Psychology. 
<BR><BR>
                "We are deeply grateful to Peter Paul for
                his extraordinary generosity. This gift will
                enable the university to attract the world's
                most outstanding scholars and scientists to
                two interdisciplinary fields in which UNH
                already holds national and international
                prominence," said President Joan R. Leitzel
                in announcing the gift. "The impact of this
                gift will be immediate and will benefit the
                university for generations to come." 
<BR><BR>
                Paul is the former president and CEO of
                Headlands Mortgage Company. Founded
                by Paul in 1986, Headlands became one of
                the premier wholesale mortgage lending
                institutions in the country. After leading
                Headlands through a successful IPO in
                February of 1998 that raised more than
                $110 million for the company, Paul
                negotiated the subsequent merger with
                GreenPoint Financial Corp. (NYSE-GPT).
                Announced in December of 1998, the deal
                was valued at approximately $475 million,
                the largest business transaction in Marin
                County, California, history. Paul continues to serve GreenPoint Financial as a
                consultant and as a member of the Board of Directors. 
<BR><BR>
                The potential for investment in the areas of space research and psychology was
                identified as part of the planning for the university's current fundraising campaign,
                The Next Horizon. "My undergraduate education at the University of New
                Hampshire has benefited me throughout my life. I believe it is important in these
                difficult times to invest in higher educational institutions that will shape the leaders of
                tomorrow who will create a strong future for our nation. You invest in things you
                know and you invest in people. I have great confidence in the leadership provided by
                President Leitzel and Provost David Hiley and in their vision for the university," said
                Paul. 
<BR><BR>
                The Peter T. Paul Chair in Space Science provides intellectual leadership for the
                Space Sciences Center within the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space
                (EOS), one of the University's most distinguished programs. The Space Sciences
                Center competes at the very top of the field in planetary plasma physics, theoretical
                solar system astrophysics, and gamma ray astronomy. It is expected that a named
                chair will help the university to compete in a select tier of institutions capable of
                defining and executing complete space missions. The funding will also link space
                physics and climate change studies, another university program of excellence. 
<BR><BR>
                The Dr. Samuel E. Paul Chair in Developmental Psychology is established in
                memory of Paul's father, Dr. Samuel E. Paul, a well-known, distinguished, and highly
                regarded physician who practiced in Troy, N.H., for nearly 30 years. This chair will
                round out the university's interdisciplinary strength in the areas of research and
                public policy in child welfare and development, families, and communities. It will
                build on the university's strength in three specific areas of research: child
                development, children at risk, and the biological bases of social stress. It will also
                provide assistance in the development of state policy through pilot programs related
                to children at risk and will greatly enhance undergraduate and graduate training in
                these important areas. 
<BR><BR>
                "Peter Paul's exceptional philanthropy gives us the momentum we need to reach the
                final stages of the most ambitious fundraising effort in the university's history," said
                Young Dawkins, III, president of the UNH Foundation. The gift brings gifts and
                pledges to the $85.5 million mark in the five-year $100 million campaign scheduled
                to run through June 2004. 
<BR><BR>
                Paul has more than 25 years experience in mortgage banking and financial services
                and currently sits on the Board of Directors of GreenPoint Financial Corp.
                (NYSE-GPT), Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (NYSE-AGM) and Sequoia
                National Bank. Ernst & Young recognized him in 1999 as Northern California's
                Financial Services Entrepreneur of the Year. Presently, he is the president of
                Headlands Group, LLC, a family investment company. A member of the Board of
                Directors of the UNH Foundation, Paul is also the owner of Grove Street Winery,
                located in Healdsburg, California. In addition to his B.S. from UNH, he earned an
                M.B.A. from Boston University in 1971. He currently resides in Larkspur,
                California.
