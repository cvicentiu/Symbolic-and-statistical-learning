        are many ways to make a gift to the University.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Cash Gifts<br>
      </h2>
      <p>The simplest way to support the University is with a cash gift. Send 
        your personal check to the UNH Annual Fund, UNH Foundation, John S. Elliott 
        Alumni Center, Durham, NH 03824. Cash gifts are tax deductible according 
        to federal law. You can also make a gift with a credit card. Many companies 
        match cash gifts. Please check with your employer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For more information: Contact Morgan Dudley, director, The Annual fund 
        via phone (603) 862-1662 or e-mail: <a href="mailto:mwdudley@cisunix.unh.edu">mwdudley@cisunix.unh.edu</a> 
        or <a href="http://www.foundation.sr.unh.edu/giftform.shtml">click here</a> 
        to make a gift online.</p>
      <h2>Appreciated Securities<br>
      </h2>
      <p>A gift of appreciated securities provides an income tax deduction equal 
        to the fair market value of the donated securities. Capital gains taxes 
        may also be avoided on the transfer. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For more information: Contact Diana Koski, vice president and director 
        of planned giving via phone (603) 862-2570 or e-mail: <a href="mailto:ddkoski@cisunix.unh.edu">ddkoski@cisunix</a><a href="mailto:ddkoski@hopper.unh.edu">.unh.edu</a> 
        or <a href="securities.html">click here</a> for information about how 
        to transfer securities. </p>
      <h2><br>
        Real and Personal Property<br>
      </h2>
      <p> Land or other real property may be given to the Foundation as an outright 
        gift or used as an asset within a charitable trust. One can also opt to 
        donate a home and retain the right to occupy the property throughout one&#146;s 
        lifetime. Personal property, such as paintings or rare books, can also 
        be contributed. If you are interested in discussing the advantages of 
        such a gift, please contact Young Dawkins III, president, at (603) 862-3694.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Planned Gifts<br>
        <b> </b> </h2>
      <p>Planned gifts, such as charitable remainder trusts and gifts to the UNH 
        Foundation Pooled Income Fund, benefit the University and can provide 
        donors with income for life. Donors can also enjoy significant benefits, 
        including tax deductions, avoidance of capital gains taxes, and increased 
        income. For more information on planned gifts, please contact Diana Koski, 
        vice president and director of planned giving, at (603) 862-2570 or <a href="mailto:ddkoski@cisunix.unh.edu">ddkoski@cisunix.unh.edu</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bequests</b><br>
        A gift to the University in a will allows donors to make a substantial 
        contribution to the University without diminishing available assets. A 
        bequest can also significantly reduce estate taxes. </p>
      <p><b>Pooled Income Fund</b><br>
        Gifts of $5,000 or more to the Foundation's Pooled Income Fund are invested 
        together with gifts of other donors, and the annual income is shared among 
        participants throughout their lifetimes. Participants incur no capital 
        gain on appreciated securities transferred to the fund, and receive a 
        charitable deduction for a portion of the gift.</p>
      <p><b>Charitable Trusts</b><br>
        Irrevocable charitable trusts can provide an income for life that varies 
        with the type and assets of the trust. Part of the trust qualifies for 
        an income tax deduction. At the death of the last beneficiary, the remainder 
        of the trust is distributed to the University for the purpose selected 
        by the donor.</p>
      <p><b>Life Insurance</b><br>
        A life insurance policy is deductible as a charitable contribution. Premiums 
        paid after the gift is made are also tax deductible.</p>
      <h2>Matching Gifts </h2>
      <p>Many companies/employers will match gifts for education. If yours is 
        one, please complete the matching gift form supplied by your employer 
        and send it to the UNH Foundation.</p>
      <p> <b>Matching gift instructions:</b> </p>
