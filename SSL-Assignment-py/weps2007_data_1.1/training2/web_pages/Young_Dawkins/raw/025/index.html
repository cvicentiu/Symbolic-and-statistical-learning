<BR>
<P>E V O  is an essay on questions of Evolution and Consciousness (completed
<BR>
September 2002).  78 minutes.
<BR>
<P>E V O
<BR>
is  a philosophical, whimsical, visually radical investigation.  It includes
<BR>
imagery created with personally hacked C.G. software, inflections of
<BR>
artificial life algorithms and fractal generators.
<BR>
<P>E V O
<BR>
One of the most significant (and controversial) scientific  discoveries of
<BR>
recent years has to do with 500 million year old fossils discovered at the
<BR>
Burgess Shale in the Yoho National Park of British Columbia, Canada.
<BR>
<P>E V O
<BR>
is a study and reflection on the history and future of evolutionary theory,
<BR>
its meaning to humans, with a focus on the question of CONTINGENCY as argued
<BR>
by Naturalist Stephen J. Gould in his best seller &quot;Wonderful Life­ The
<BR>
Burgess Shale and the Nature of History&quot;.
<BR>
<P>E V O
<BR>
is  a demanding intellectual documentary  - a style in very short supply -
<BR>
refusing to dumb down,  E V O  is rather a &quot;wise up&quot; documentary about the
<BR>
most important ideas of humanity - evolution, natural selection, genetic
<BR>
engineering, liberty, and ecology.
<BR>
<P>Dr. Richard Dawkins, Oxford professor and reigning theorist of Evolution -
<BR>
reads selections from some of his books,  Dr. Desmond Collins, Senior
<BR>
Curator/Palaeontologist of the Royal Ontario Museum gives a history of the
<BR>
discoveries and controversies/spins about the Burgess Shale and their social
<BR>
ramifications.  As well the work reflects on some of  the key historical
<BR>
personages of evolution  - Charles Darwin and his principal European
<BR>
disciple: Ernst Haeckel of Jena, Germany.
<BR>
<P>E V O is available in 16:9 anamorphic video, 78 minutes -regular format, and
<BR>
as an extended DVD.
<BR>
<P>Distribution: Video Out - <A HREF="mailto:videoout@telus.net?subject=Re:%20E%20V%20O%20-%20PREMIERE%20-%20AT%20THE%20VANCOUVER%20INTERNATIONAL%20FILM%20FESTIVAL%20-%202002">videoout@telus.net</A>

RICHARD DAWKINS
<BR>
<P>Awards and Accomplishments
<BR>
<P>Richard Dawkins won both the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los
<BR>
Angeles Times Literary Prize in 1987 for The Blind Watchmaker. The
<BR>
television film of the book, shown in the 'Horizon' series, won the Sci-Tech
<BR>
Prize for the Best Science Programme of 1987. He has also won the 1989
<BR>
Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London and the 1990 Royal Society
<BR>
Michael Faraday Award for the furtherance of the public understanding of
<BR>
science. In 1994 he won the Nakayama Prize for Human Science and in 1995 was
<BR>
awarded an Honorary D.Litt. by the University of St Andrews. Humanist of the
<BR>
Year Award 1996. Since 1996 has been Vice President of the British Humanist
<BR>
Association. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997.
<BR>
Winner of the 1997 (Fifth) International Cosmos Prize in Commemoration of
<BR>
Expo' 90.
<BR>
<P><P>Born and raised in East Africa, Dawkins grew up amid one of the most
<BR>
irresistible bioscapes on Earth. Dawkins came to Oxford in 1959 as an
<BR>
undergraduate, and eventually came under the spell of Niko Tinbergen, the
<BR>
eminent Danish biologist. Author of The Study of Instinct and winner of the
<BR>
Nobel Prize in biology for his pioneering work on animal behavior, Tinbergen
<BR>
was one of the first of the modern ethologists (biologists who explore and
<BR>
explain the nature of animal behavior). What is instinct? Tinbergen would
<BR>
ask. What behavior is learned? How can we truly know the difference? How
<BR>
does behavior change? How do animals communicate? How do animals behave
<BR>
differently in groups than they do as individuals? Why do animals cooperate?
<BR>
How do they compete?
<BR>
<P>Ethology, as Tinbergen constantly stressed, was a highly interdisciplinary
<BR>
biological science, requiring insights into psychology, physiology, ecology,
<BR>
sociology, taxonomy, and evolution. Tinbergen focused on the eternal tension
<BR>
between the breadth of behaviors observed in nature and a scientist's need
<BR>
to reduce these behaviors to a set of fundamental principles. &quot;My own
<BR>
dominant recollection of his undergraduate lectures,&quot; Dawkins recalls, &quot;was
<BR>
that I was particularly taken with two phrases of his - behavior machinery
<BR>
and equipment for survival. When I came to write my first book, I combined
<BR>
them into the brief phrase survival machine.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Dawkins developed a special mentor relationship with Tinbergen. After a
<BR>
stint at the University of California at Berkeley, Dawkins returned to his
<BR>
alma mater, where he ultimately became a fellow at New College (he still
<BR>
teaches there).
<BR>
<P>Dawkins's dual interest in the nature of machines and the machinery of
<BR>
nature took place amid the rise of molecular biology. Just a few years after
<BR>
Francis Crick and James Watson's 1953 discovery of the double helix, the
<BR>
molecular biologists - not the naturalists, zoologists, or ethologists -
<BR>
began calling the intellectual shots in biology. The increased ability to
<BR>
track and explain what the genome was and what it was doing - classic
<BR>
reductionalist science as opposed to mere descriptive taxonomies -
<BR>
radicalized the way nature was observed. Centuries of animal breeding had,
<BR>
of course, created an explicit awareness of links between genetic endowment
<BR>
and behavior. The double helix became the new scaffold for erecting theories
<BR>
of evolution.
<BR>
<P>For the young Dawkins, the ethology of Tinbergen quickly became the
<BR>
conceptual lens through which he viewed the world. Behavior, say of the
<BR>
chicks he studied as a graduate student, was the empirical observation that
<BR>
Dawkins sought to identify and explain. At the same time he was observing
<BR>
chicken processing, Dawkins was busy processing his data with a clunky
<BR>
punch-tape Eliot 803. The machinery metaphor - the machinery meme - that
<BR>
resonated with and reinforced Tinbergen's ideas ultimately welded itself to
<BR>
Dawkins's strong notions of the primacy of the gene. What happens to
<BR>
scientific thinking if the survival machine is defined by the machinery of
<BR>
the genes?
<BR>
<P>Amid this primordial soup of new paradigms, Richard Dawkins the ethologist
<BR>
rapidly mutated into an evolutionary biologist. In 1965, he hit upon an idea
<BR>
breathtakingly simple to understand but extraordinarily powerful in its
<BR>
implications. In essence, Dawkins argued for an ethology of the gene: How do
<BR>
genes communicate? How do genes behave differently in groups than they do as
<BR>
individuals? Why do genes cooperate? How do genes compete? The same
<BR>
questions ethologists ask about chicks and geese and chimpanzees are
<BR>
virtually identical to the sorts of questions they should be asking about
<BR>
the genome and its genes.
<BR>
<P>Others had played with this notion before, but Dawkins made it his own and
<BR>
aggressively pushed it into the mainstream of science culture.
<BR>
<P>As the first true ethologist of the gene, Dawkins de facto became an
<BR>
evolutionary biologist. How genes behave over time - which ones dominate,
<BR>
which ones die off, which ones cooperate, which ones compete, which ones
<BR>
change, which ones remain the same - is the very definition of an evolution
<BR>
based on the flow of information.
<BR>
<P>When Dawkins published The Selfish Gene in 1976, the book further heated the
<BR>
debate over whether humans were ruled more by nature or nurture, a debate
<BR>
refueled by the emerging sociobiologists - notably Harvard biologist Edward
<BR>
O. Wilson in his 1975 book Sociobiology. By proposing an ethology of the
<BR>
gene, Dawkins shifted that debate away from the individual animal as the
<BR>
unit of evolution to the nature, nurture, and behavior of the genes. With
<BR>
The Selfish Gene, Dawkins offered scientists a conceptual bridge between the
<BR>
reductionist imperatives of molecular biology and the taxonomies of zoology,
<BR>
psychology, and sociology. In other words, the metaphor of the selfish gene
<BR>
not only created an important context to explain human and animal behavior -
<BR>
it also created a framework for molecular biologists to examine the organic
<BR>
interactions of genes. The metaphor scaled from double helices to human
<BR>
interactions.
<BR>
<P>But looking at the richness and complexity of life on Earth, Dawkins freely
<BR>
acknowledged that an ethology of the gene alone was simply not robust enough
<BR>
to explain evolution. So he applied a Darwinian view of culture, as well.
<BR>
Dawkins argued for the concept of memes - ideas that are, to use the
<BR>
felicitous phrase of William Burroughs, &quot;viruses of the mind.&quot; Memes are to
<BR>
cultural inheritance what genes are to biological heredity. A meme for, say,
<BR>
astrology, could parasitize a mind just as surely as a hookworm could infest
<BR>
someone's bowels. Ideas - like genes - could compete and cooperate, mutate
<BR>
and conserve. They, too, are operated on by natural selection. Human
<BR>
evolution, Dawkins postulates, is a function of a co-evolution between genes
<BR>
and memes.
<BR>
<P>Even that was not enough. Dawkins's intellectual adventure went well beyond
<BR>
the ethology of genes and memes to explore an even more radical insight into
<BR>
the nature of evolutionary dynamics. This idea, too, was astonishingly
<BR>
simple, but it offers a powerful intellectual framework for a new
<BR>
understanding of life as an information process.
<BR>
<P>What do genes and memes have in common? Dawkins asked. They are replicators.
<BR>
Through various but distinct coded systems, they reproduce; they effect
<BR>
change in their world so they can propagate, just like viruses in either
<BR>
digital or organic form. Dawkins's most powerful paradigm is that the unit
<BR>
of evolution is not the individual - the gene - or the meme, but the
<BR>
replicator.
<BR>
<P>This was apostasy to Darwinian evolutionists, who took it as dogma that the
<BR>
dynamics of natural selection cared only for the fitness of individual
<BR>
organisms and absolutely nothing else. But here was Dawkins saying that what
<BR>
really counted in &quot;nature tooth and claw&quot; was the replicating code beneath
<BR>
the organism. Evolution is really the story of replicators ber alles.
<BR>
<P>Dawkins aggressively evolved this replicator concept. He noted that
<BR>
discussing the evolution of birds without looking hard at the evolution of
<BR>
their nests, or at beavers without considering the evolution of their dams
<BR>
would be prima facie ridiculous. Each is essential to the survival of the
<BR>
other. It is the combination of bird and nest, the combination of beaver and
<BR>
dam, that gives a competitive edge to the animals who build them. Not only
<BR>
does the body of an organism march to the orders of its genes, but so do the
<BR>
artifacts the organism builds or uses. In this sense, the egg uses both a
<BR>
chicken and a nest to make another egg, and so the nest, too, is an
<BR>
evolutionary extension of the egg.
<BR>
<P>In biology, the genes in the egg would be called its genotype, while the
<BR>
physical expression of those genes - the chicken - would be called its
<BR>
phenotype. Dawkins called this marriage of organism to artifact The Extended
<BR>
Phenotype - the title of his second book, published in 1982. Still extending
<BR>
the outer limits of his replicator idea, Dawkins used this &quot;extended
<BR>
phenotype&quot; construct to look beyond the individual and artifact to embrace
<BR>
the family of the organism, its social group, the tools and environments it
<BR>
created. These are part of the physical &quot;readout&quot; of the genes, the extended
<BR>
phenotype of the replicating code. The invisible code in genes are
<BR>
therefore, in a very real sense, manipulating large chunks of the visible
<BR>
world to their selfish advantage.
<BR>
<P>Of course humans - with our massive and complex array of technologies - have
<BR>
extended our phenotypes more than any other living species. Just like a
<BR>
bird's nest, a beaver's dam, or a groundhog's intricate set of underground
<BR>
tunnels, our technologies are now an integral part of our evolutionary
<BR>
fitness. In light of Dawkins's work, to be a scientist today and talk about
<BR>
human evolution divorced from technological evolution no longer makes sense.
<BR>
In the truest and most fundamental sense, human evolution is now
<BR>
inextricably bound with technological evolution. Taken to its natural
<BR>
conclusion, Dawkins's idea suggests that humankind is really co-evolving
<BR>
with its artifacts; genes that can't cope with that new reality will not
<BR>
survive into future millennia.
<BR>
<P>What happens to life - to artificial life - when our unit of evolutionary
<BR>
observation becomes the replicator? By framing life and its evolution in the
<BR>
context of replicators and networks of replicators, Dawkins has forced all
<BR>
of biology to reexamine its assumptions of the fundamental mechanics of
<BR>
living things. Is technology just what our genes want, or is it a cultural
<BR>
conspiracy of our genes and memes? Does human DNA control the technosphere
<BR>
we've created and live in and around? What does it mean to say that nerve
<BR>
gas and microprocessors are extensions of selfish genes? These questions -
<BR>
as much as the genetic underpinning of embryology and neurophysiology - are
<BR>
the sorts of questions that evolutionists must now address, posits Dawkins.
<BR>
<P>So essential is Dawkins's work to redefining life that he might have fairly
<BR>
titled one of his books On the Origin of Replicators and expected it to
<BR>
revolutionize science in the most radical fashion since Darwin. But Dawkins
<BR>
is not the sort to run the risk of parodying Darwin in this way, because of
<BR>
his respect for the principles of natural selection. Already, however, this
<BR>
transforming view is proving to be an extraordinarily robust meme that is
<BR>
rapidly replicating in human minds.
<BR>
<P>When Dawkins spoke at the first artificial life conference in Los Alamos,
<BR>
New Mexico, in 1987, he delivered a paper on &quot;The Evolution of
<BR>
Evolvability.&quot; This essay argues that evolvability is a trait that can be
<BR>
(and has been) selected for in evolution. The ability to be genetically
<BR>
responsive to the environment through such a mechanism as, say, sex, has an
<BR>
enormous impact on one's evolutionary fitness. Dawkins's paper has become
<BR>
essential reading in the artificial life community. His multidisciplinary,
<BR>
interdisciplinary fluency in fields ranging from ethology to software has
<BR>
made him someone who is closely watched not only by fans of his popular
<BR>
books but especially by his scientific peers, who range from Stephen Jay
<BR>
Gould to Marvin Minsky to Roger Penrose.
