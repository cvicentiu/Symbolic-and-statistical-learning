<P> I was born in the year one, of the present or Christian hera, and 
 am, in consquints, seven-and-thirty years old.  My mamma called me 
 Charles James Harrington Fitzroy Yellowplush, in compliment to 
 several noble families, and to a sellybrated coachmin whom she  knew, 
who wore a yellow livry, and drove the Lord Mayor of London. </P>
<P> Why she gev me this genlmn's name is a diffiklty, or rayther the 
 name of a part of his dress; however, it's stuck to me through  life, 
in which I was, as it were, a footman by buth. </P>
<P> Praps he was my father&#8212;though on this subjict I can't speak 
 suttinly, for my ma wrapped up my buth in a mistry.  I may be 
 illygitmit, I may have been changed at nuss; but I've always had 
 genlmnly tastes through life, and have no doubt that I come of a 
 genlmnly origum. </P>
<P> The less I say about my parint the better, for the dear old creatur 
 was very good to me, and, I fear, had very little other goodness in 
 her.  Why, I can't say; but I always passed as her nevyou.  We led  a 
strange life; sometimes ma was dressed in sattn and rooge, and 
 sometimes in rags and dutt; sometimes I got kisses, and sometimes 
 kix; sometimes gin, and sometimes shampang; law bless us! how she 
 used to swear at me, and cuddle me; there we were, quarrelling and 
 making up, sober and tipsy, starving and guttling by turns, just as 
 ma got money or spent it.  But let me draw a vail over the seen,  and 
speak of her no more&#8212;its 'sfishant for the public to know,  that her 
name was Miss Montmorency, and we lived in the New Cut. </P>
<P> My poor mother died one morning, Hev,n bless her! and I was left 
 alone in this wide wicked wuld, without so much money as would buy  me 
a penny roal for my brexfast.  But there was some amongst our  naybors 
(and let me tell you there's more kindness among them poor 
 disrepettable creaturs, than in half a dozen lords or barrynets)  who 
took pity upon poor Sal's orfin (for they bust out laffin when  I 
called her Miss Montmorency), and gev me bred and shelter.  I'm 
 afraid, in spite of their kindness, that my MORRILS wouldn't have 
 improved if I'd stayed long among 'em.  But a benny-violent genlmn 
 saw me, and put me to school.  The academy which I went to was  called 
the Free School of Saint Bartholomew's the Less&#8212;the young  genlmn wore 
green baize coats, yellow leather whatsisnames, a tin  plate on the 
left arm, and a cap about the size of a muffing.  I  stayed there sicks 
years; from sicks, that is to say, till my  twelth year, during three 
years of witch I distinguished myself not  a little in the musicle way, 
for I bloo the bellus of the church  horgin, and very fine tunes we 
played too. </P>
<P> Well, it's not worth recounting my jewvenile follies (what trix we 
 used to play the applewoman! and how we put snuff in the old  clark's 
Prayer-book&#8212;my eye!); but one day, a genlmn entered the 
 school-room&#8212;it was on the very day when I went to subtraxion&#8212;and 
 asked the master for a young lad for a servant.  They pitched upon  me 
glad enough; and nex day found me sleeping in the sculry, close  under 
the sink, at Mr. Bago's country-house at Pentonwille. </P>
<P> Bago kep a shop in Smithfield market, and drov a taring good trade 
 in the hoil and Italian way.  I've heard him say, that he cleared  no 
less than fifty pounds every year by letting his front room at  hanging 
time.  His winders looked right opsit Newgit, and many and  many dozen 
chaps has he seen hanging there.  Laws was laws in the  year ten, and 
they screwed chaps' nex for nex to nothink.  But my  bisniss was at his 
country-house, where I made my first ontray into  fashnabl life.  I was 
knife, errint, and stable-boy then, and an't  ashamed to own it; for my 
merrits have raised me to what I am&#8212;two  livries, forty pound a year, 
malt-licker, washin, silk-stocking,  and wax candles&#8212;not countin 
wails, which is somethink pretty  considerable at OUR house, I can tell 
you. </P>
<P> I didn't stay long here, for a suckmstance happened which got me a 
 very different situation.  A handsome young genlmn, who kep a  tilbry 
and a ridin horse at livry, wanted a tiger.  I bid at once  for the 
place; and, being a neat tidy-looking lad, he took me.  Bago gave me a 
character, and he my first livry; proud enough I was  of it, as you may 
fancy. </P>
<P> My new master had some business in the city, for he went in every 
 morning at ten, got out of his tilbry at the Citty Road, and had it 
 waiting for him at six; when, if it was summer, he spanked round  into 
the Park, and drove one of the neatest turnouts there.  Wery  proud I 
was in a gold-laced hat, a drab coat and a red weskit, to  sit by his 
side, when he drove.  I already began to ogle the gals  in the 
carridges, and to feel that longing for fashionabl life  which I've had 
ever since.  When he was at the oppera, or the play,  down I went to 
skittles, or to White Condick Gardens; and Mr.  Frederic Altamont's 
young man was somebody, I warrant: to be sure  there is very few 
man-servants at Pentonwille, the poppylation  being mostly gals of all 
work; and so, though only fourteen, I was  as much a man down there, as 
if I had been as old as Jerusalem. </P>
<P> But the most singular thing was, that my master, who was such a gay 
 chap, should live in such a hole.  He had only a ground-floor in  John 
Street&#8212;a parlor and a bedroom.  I slep over the way, and only  came in 
with his boots and brexfast of a morning. </P>
<P> The house he lodged in belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Shum.  They were a 
 poor but proliffic couple, who had rented the place for many years; 
 and they and their family were squeezed in it pretty tight, I can 
 tell you. </P>
<P> Shum said he had been a hofficer, and so he had.  He had been a 
 sub-deputy assistant vice-commissary, or some such think; and, as  I 
heerd afterwards, had been obliged to leave on account of his 
 NERVOUSNESS.  He was such a coward, the fact is, that he was 
 considered dangerous to the harmy, and sent home. </P>
<P> He had married a widow Buckmaster, who had been a Miss Slamcoe. 
 She was a Bristol gal; and her father being a bankrup in the 
 tallow-chandlering way, left, in course, a pretty little sum of 
 money.  A thousand pound was settled on her; and she was as high  and 
mighty as if it had been a millium. </P>
<P> Buckmaster died, leaving nothink; nothink except four ugly 
 daughters by Miss Slamcoe: and her forty pound a year was rayther  a 
narrow income for one of her appytite and pretensions.  In an  unlucky 
hour for Shum she met him.  He was a widower with a little  daughter of 
three years old, a little house at Pentonwille, and a  little income 
about as big as her own.  I believe she bullyd the  poor creature into 
marridge; and it was agreed that he should let  his ground-floor at 
John Street, and so add somethink to their  means. </P>
<P> They married; and the widow Buckmaster was the gray mare, I can 
 tell you.  She was always talking and blustering about her famly,  the 
celebrity of the Buckmasters, and the antickety of the  Slamcoes.  They 
had a six-roomed house (not counting kitching and  sculry), and now 
twelve daughters in all; whizz.&#8212;4 Miss  Buckmasters: Miss Betsy, Miss 
Dosy, Miss Biddy, and Miss Winny;  1 Miss Shum, Mary by name, Shum's 
daughter, and seven others, who  shall be nameless.  Mrs. Shum was a 
fat, red-haired woman, at least  a foot taller than S.; who was but a 
yard and a half high, pale-  faced, red-nosed, knock-kneed, 
bald-headed, his nose and shut-frill  all brown with snuff. </P>
<P> Before the house was a little garden, where the washin of the famly 
 was all ways hanging.  There was so many of 'em that it was obliged 
 to be done by relays.  There was six rails and a stocking on each, 
 and four small goosbry bushes, always covered with some bit of 
 linning or other.  The hall was a regular puddle: wet dabs of 
 dishclouts flapped in your face; soapy smoking bits of flanning  went 
nigh to choke you; and while you were looking up to prevent  hanging 
yourself with the ropes which were strung across and about,  slap came 
the hedge of a pail against your shins, till one was like  to be drove 
mad with hagony.  The great slattnly doddling girls was  always on the 
stairs, poking about with nasty flower-pots, a-  cooking something, or 
sprawling in the window-seats with greasy  curl-papers, reading greasy 
novels.  An infernal pianna was  jingling from morning till night&#8212;two 
eldest Miss Buckmasters,  &quot;Battle of Prag&quot;&#8212;six youngest Miss Shums, 
&quot;In my Cottage,&quot; till I  knew every note in the &quot;Battle of Prag,&quot; and 
cussed the day when  &quot;In my Cottage&quot; was rote.  The younger girls, too, 
were always  bouncing and thumping about the house, with torn 
pinnyfores, and  dogs-eard grammars, and large pieces of bread and 
treacle.  I never  see such a house. </P>
<P> As for Mrs. Shum, she was such a fine lady, that she did nothink 
 but lay on the drawing-room sophy, read novels, drink, scold,  scream, 
and go into hystarrix.  Little Shum kep reading an old  newspaper from 
weeks' end to weeks' end, when he was not engaged in  teaching the 
children, or goin for the beer, or cleanin the shoes:  for they kep no 
servant.  This house in John Street was in short a  regular Pandymony. </P>
<P> What could have brought Mr. Frederic Altamont to dwell in such a 
 place?  The reason is hobvius: he adoared the fust Miss Shum. </P>
<P> And suttnly he did not show a bad taste; for though the other 
 daughters were as ugly as their hideous ma, Mary Shum was a pretty 
 little pink, modest creatur, with glossy black hair and tender blue 
 eyes, and a neck as white as plaster of Parish.  She wore a dismal 
 old black gownd, which had grown too short for her, and too tight; 
 but it only served to show her pretty angles and feet, and bewchus 
 figger.  Master, though he had looked rather low for the gal of his 
 art, had certainly looked in the right place.  Never was one more 
 pretty or more hamiable.  I gav her always the buttered toast left 
 from our brexfust, and a cup of tea or chocklate, as Altamont might 
 fancy: and the poor thing was glad enough of it, I can vouch; for 
 they had precious short commons up stairs, and she the least of  all. </P>
<P> For it seemed as if which of the Shum famly should try to snub the 
 poor thing most.  There was the four Buckmaster girls always at  her. 
 It was, Mary, git the coal-skittle; Mary, run down to the 
 public-house for the beer; Mary, I intend to wear your clean  stockens 
out walking, or your new bonnet to church.  Only her poor  father was 
kind to her; and he, poor old muff! his kindness was of  no use.  Mary 
bore all the scolding like a hangel, as she was: no,  not if she had a 
pair of wings and a goold trumpet, could she have  been a greater 
hangel. </P>
<P> I never shall forgit one seen that took place.  It was when Master 
 was in the city; and so, having nothink earthly to do, I happened  to 
be listening on the stairs.  The old scolding was a-going on,  and the 
old tune of that hojus &quot;Battle of Prag.&quot;  Old Shum made  some remark; 
and Miss Buckmaster cried out, &quot;Law, pa! what a fool  you are!&quot;  All 
the gals began laffin, and so did Mrs. Shum; all,  that is, excep Mary, 
who turned as red as flams, and going up to  Miss Betsy Buckmaster, 
give her two such wax on her great red ears  as made them tingle again. </P>
<P> Old Mrs. Shum screamed, and ran at her like a Bengal tiger.  Her 
 great arms vent veeling about like a vinmill, as she cuffed and 
 thumped poor Mary for taking her pa's part.  Mary Shum, who was 
 always a-crying before, didn't shed a tear now.  &quot;I will do it 
 again,&quot; she said, &quot;if Betsy insults my father.&quot;  New thumps, new 
 shreex; and the old horridan went on beatin the poor girl till she 
 was quite exosted, and fell down on the sophy, puffin like a  poppus. </P>
<P> &quot;For shame, Mary,&quot; began old Shum; &quot;for shame, you naughty gal, 
 you! for hurting the feelings of your dear mamma, and beating your 
 kind sister.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, it was because she called you a&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;If she did, you pert miss,&quot; said Shum, looking mighty dignitified, 
 &quot;I could correct her, and not you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You correct me, indeed!&quot; said Miss Betsy, turning up her nose, if 
 possible, higher than before; &quot;I should like to see you erect me! 
 Imperence!&quot; and they all began laffin again. </P>
<P> By this time Mrs. S. had recovered from the effex of her exsize, 
 and she began to pour in HER wolly.  Fust she called Mary names,  then 
Shum. </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, why,&quot; screeched she, &quot;why did I ever leave a genteel famly, 
 where I ad every ellygance and lucksry, to marry a creatur like  this? 
 He is unfit to be called a man, he is unworthy to marry a 
 gentlewoman; and as for that hussy, I disown her.  Thank heaven she 
 an't a Slamcoe; she is only fit to be a Shum!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;That's true, mamma,&quot; said all the gals; for their mother had 
 taught them this pretty piece of manners, and they despised their 
 father heartily: indeed, I have always remarked that, in famlies 
 where the wife is internally talking about the merits of her  branch, 
the husband is invariably a spooney. </P>
<P> Well, when she was exosted again, down she fell on the sofy, at her 
 old trix&#8212;more screeching&#8212;more convulshuns: and she wouldn't stop, 
 this time, till Shum had got her half a pint of her old remedy,  from 
the &quot;Blue Lion&quot; over the way.  She grew more easy as she  finished the 
gin; but Mary was sent out of the room, and told not  to come back agin 
all day. </P>
<P> &quot;Miss Mary,&quot; says I,&#8212;for my heart yurned to the poor gal, as she 
 came sobbing and miserable down stairs: &quot;Miss Mary,&quot; says I, &quot;if I 
 might make so bold, here's master's room empty, and I know where  the 
cold bif and pickles is.&quot;  &quot;Oh, Charles!&quot; said she, nodding her  head 
sadly, &quot;I'm too retched to have any happytite.&quot;  And she flung  herself 
on a chair, and began to cry fit to bust. </P>
<P> At this moment who should come in but my master.  I had taken hold 
 of Miss Mary's hand, somehow, and do believe I should have kist it, 
 when, as I said, Haltamont made his appearance.  &quot;What's this?&quot;  cries 
he, lookin at me as black as thunder, or as Mr. Phillips as  Hickit, in 
the new tragedy of MacBuff. </P>
<P> &quot;It's only Miss Mary, sir,&quot; answered I. </P>
<P> &quot;Get out, sir,&quot; says he, as fierce as posbil; and I felt somethink 
 (I think it was the tip of his to) touching me behind, and found 
 myself, nex minit, sprawling among the wet flannings and buckets  and 
things. </P>
<P> The people from up stairs came to see what was the matter, as I was 
 cussin and crying out.  &quot;It's only Charles, ma,&quot; screamed out Miss 
 Betsy. </P>
<P> &quot;Where's Mary?&quot; says Mrs. Shum, from the sofy. </P>
<P> &quot;She's in Master's room, miss,&quot; said I. </P>
<P> &quot;She's in the lodger's room, ma,&quot; cries Miss Shum, heckoing me. </P>
<P> &quot;Very good; tell her to stay there till he comes back.&quot;  And then 
 Miss Shum went bouncing up the stairs again, little knowing of 
 Haltamont's return. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> I'd long before observed that my master had an anchoring after Mary 
 Shum; indeed, as I have said, it was purely for her sake that he  took 
and kep his lodgings at Pentonwille.  Excep for the sake of  love, 
which is above being mersnary, fourteen shillings a wick was  a LITTLE 
too strong for two such rat-holes as he lived in.  I do  blieve the 
famly had nothing else but their lodger to live on: they  brekfisted 
off his tea-leaves, they cut away pounds and pounds of  meat from his 
jints (he always dined at home), and his baker's bill  was at least 
enough for six.  But that wasn't my business.  I saw  him grin, 
sometimes, when I laid down the cold bif of a morning, to  see how 
little was left of yesterday's sirline; but he never said a  syllabub: 
for true love don't mind a pound of meat or so hextra. </P>
<P> At first, he was very kind and attentive to all the gals; Miss 
 Betsy, in partickler, grew mighty fond of him: they sat, for whole 
 evenings, playing cribbitch, he taking his pipe and glas, she her  tea 
and muffing; but as it was improper for her to come alone, she  brought 
one of her sisters, and this was genrally Mary,&#8212;for he  made a pint of 
asking her, too,&#8212;and one day, when one of the  others came instead, he 
told her, very quitely, that he hadn't  invited her; and Miss 
Buckmaster was too fond of muffings to try  this game on again: 
besides, she was jealous of her three grown  sisters, and considered 
Mary as only a child.  Law bless us! how  she used to ogle him, and 
quot bits of pottry, and play &quot;Meet Me by  Moonlike,&quot; on an old gitter: 
she reglar flung herself at his head:  but he wouldn't have it, bein 
better ockypied elsewhere. </P>
<P> One night, as genteel as possible, he brought home tickets for 
 &quot;Ashley's,&quot; and proposed to take the two young ladies&#8212;Miss Betsy  and 
Miss Mary, in course.  I recklect he called me aside that  afternoon, 
assuming a solamon and misterus hare, &quot;Charles,&quot; said  he, &quot;ARE YOU UP 
TO SNUFF?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why sir,&quot; said I, &quot;I'm genrally considered tolerably downy.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;I'll give you half a suffering if you can manage 
 this bisness for me; I've chose a rainy night on purpus.  When the 
 theatre is over, you must be waitin with two umbrellows; give me  one, 
and hold the other over Miss Buckmaster: and, hark ye, sir,  TURN TO 
THE RIGHT when you leave the theater, and say the coach is  ordered to 
stand a little way up the street, in order to get rid of  the crowd.&quot; </P>
<P> We went (in a fly hired by Mr. A.), and never shall I forgit 
 Cartliche's hacting on that memrable night.  Talk of Kimble! talk  of 
Magreedy!  Ashley's for my money, with Cartlitch in the  principal 
part.  But this is nothink to the porpus.  When the play  was over, I 
was at the door with the umbrellos.  It was raining  cats and dogs, 
sure enough. </P>
<P> Mr. Altamont came out presently, Miss Mary under his arm, and Miss 
 Betsy following behind, rayther sulky.  &quot;This way, sir,&quot; cries I, 
 pushin forward; and I threw a great cloak over Miss Betsy, fit to 
 smother her.  Mr. A. and Miss Mary skipped on and was out of sight 
 when Miss Betsy's cloak was settled, you may be sure. </P>
<P> &quot;They're only gone to the fly, miss.  It's a little way up the 
 street, away from the crowd of carridges.&quot;  And off we turned TO  THE 
RIGHT, and no mistake. </P>
<P> After marchin a little through the plash and mud, &quot;Has anybody seen 
 Coxy's fly?&quot; cries I, with the most innocent haxent in the world. </P>
<P> &quot;Cox's fly!&quot; hollows out one chap.  &quot;Is it the vaggin you want?&quot; 
 says another.  &quot;I see the blackin wan pass,&quot; giggles out another 
 gentlmn; and there was such a hinterchange of compliments as you 
 never heerd.  I pass them over though, because some of 'em were not 
 wery genteel. </P>
<P> &quot;Law, miss,&quot; said I, &quot;what shall I do?  My master will never 
 forgive me; and I haven't a single sixpence to pay a coach.&quot;  Miss 
 Betsy was just going to call one when I said that; but the coachman 
 wouldn't have it at that price, he said, and I knew very well that 
 SHE hadn't four or five shillings to pay for a wehicle.  So, in the 
 midst of that tarin rain, at midnight, we had to walk four miles, 
 from Westminster Bridge to Pentonwille; and what was wuss, I DIDN'T 
 HAPPEN TO KNOW THE WAY.  A very nice walk it was, and no mistake. </P>
<P> At about half-past two, we got safe to John Street.  My master was 
 at the garden gate.  Miss Mary flew into Miss Betsy's arms, while 
 master begun cussin and swearing at me for disobeying his orders,  and 
TURNING TO THE RIGHT INSTEAD OF TO THE LEFT!  Law bless me! his 
 hacting of hanger was very near as natral and as terrybl as Mr. 
 Cartlich's in the play. </P>
<P> They had waited half an hour, he said, in the fly, in the little 
 street at the left of the theater; they had drove up and down in  the 
greatest fright possible; and at last came home, thinking it  was in 
vain to wait any more.  They gave her 'ot rum-and-water and  roast 
oysters for supper, and this consoled her a little. </P>
<P> I hope nobody will cast an imputation on Miss Mary for HER share in 
 this adventer, for she was as honest a gal as ever lived, and I do 
 believe is hignorant to this day of our little strattygim.  Besides, 
 all's fair in love; and, as my master could never get to see her 
 alone, on account of her infernal eleven sisters and ma, he took  this 
opportunity of expressin his attachment to her. </P>
<P> If he was in love with her before, you may be sure she paid it him 
 back again now.  Ever after the night at Ashley's, they were as 
 tender as two tuttle-doves&#8212;which fully accounts for the axdent  what 
happened to me, in being kicked out of the room: and in course  I bore 
no mallis. </P>
<P> I don't know whether Miss Betsy still fancied that my master was in 
 love with her, but she loved muffings and tea, and kem down to his 
 parlor as much as ever. </P>
<P> Now comes the sing'lar part of my history. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_1_2">CHAPTER II.</A></H3>
<P> But who was this genlmn with a fine name&#8212;Mr. Frederic Altamont? or 
 what was he?  The most mysterus genlmn that ever I knew.  Once I  said 
to him on a wery rainy day, &quot;Sir, shall I bring the gig down  to your 
office?&quot; and he gave me one of his black looks and one of  his loudest 
hoaths, and told me to mind my own bizziness, and  attend to my orders. 
 Another day,&#8212;it was on the day when Miss  Mary slapped Miss Betsy's 
face,&#8212;Miss M., who adoared him, as I  have said already, kep on asking 
him what was his buth, parentidg,  and ediccation.  &quot;Dear Frederic,&quot; 
says she, &quot;why this mistry about  yourself and your hactions? why hide 
from your little Mary&quot;&#8212;they  were as tender as this, I can tell 
you&#8212;&quot;your buth and your  professin?&quot; </P>
<P> I spose Mr. Frederic looked black, for I was ONLY listening, and he 
 said, in a voice hagitated by emotion, &quot;Mary,&quot; said he, &quot;if you  love 
me, ask me this no more: let it be sfishnt for you to know  that I am a 
honest man, and that a secret, what it would be misery  for you to 
larn, must hang over all my actions&#8212;that is from ten  o'clock till 
six.&quot; </P>
<P> They went on chaffin and talking in this melumcolly and mysterus 
 way, and I didn't lose a word of what they said; for them houses  in 
Pentonwille have only walls made of pasteboard, and you hear  rayther 
better outside the room than in.  But, though he kep up his  secret, he 
swore to her his affektion this day pint blank.  Nothing  should 
prevent him, he said, from leading her to the halter, from  makin her 
his adoarable wife.  After this was a slight silence.  &quot;Dearest 
Frederic,&quot; mummered out miss, speakin as if she was  chokin, &quot;I am 
yours&#8212;yours for ever.&quot;  And then silence agen, and  one or two smax, 
as if there was kissin going on.  Here I thought  it best to give a 
rattle at the door-lock; for, as I live, there  was old Mrs. Shum 
a-walkin down the stairs! </P>
<P> It appears that one of the younger gals, a-looking out of the bed- 
 rum window, had seen my master come in, and coming down to tea half 
 an hour afterwards, said so in a cussary way.  Old Mrs. Shum, who  was 
a dragon of vertyou, cam bustling down the stairs, panting and 
 frowning, as fat and as fierce as a old sow at feedin time. </P>
<P> &quot;Where's the lodger, fellow?&quot; says she to me. </P>
<P> I spoke loud enough to be heard down the street&#8212;&quot;If you mean, 
 ma'am, my master, Mr. Frederic Altamont, esquire, he's just stept  in, 
and is puttin on clean shoes in his bedroom.&quot; </P>
<P> She said nothink in answer, but flumps past me, and opening the 
 parlor-door, sees master looking very queer, and Miss Mary a- 
 drooping down her head like a pale lily. </P>
<P> &quot;Did you come into my famly,&quot; says she, &quot;to corrupt my daughters, 
 and to destroy the hinnocence of that infamous gal?  Did you come 
 here, sir, as a seducer, or only as a lodger?  Speak, sir, speak!&quot;&#8212; 
 and she folded her arms quite fierce, and looked like Mrs. Siddums  in 
the Tragic Mews. </P>
<P> &quot;I came here, Mrs. Shum,&quot; said he, &quot;because I loved your daughter, 
 or I never would have condescended to live in such a beggarly hole.  I 
have treated her in every respect like a genlmn, and she is as 
 innocent now, ma'm, as she was when she was born.  If she'll marry 
 me, I am ready; if she'll leave you, she shall have a home where  she 
shall be neither bullyd nor starved: no hangry frumps of  sisters, no 
cross mother-in-law, only an affeckshnat husband, and  all the pure 
pleasures of Hyming.&quot; </P>
<P> Mary flung herself into his arms&#8212;&quot;Dear, dear Frederic,&quot; says she, 
 &quot;I'll never leave you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Miss,&quot; says Mrs. Shum, &quot;you ain't a Slamcoe nor yet a Buckmaster, 
 thank God.  You may marry this person if your pa thinks proper, and 
 he may insult me&#8212;brave me&#8212;trample on my feelinx in my own house&#8212; 
 and there's no-o-o-obody by to defend me.&quot; </P>
<P> I knew what she was going to be at: on came her histarrix agen, and 
 she began screechin and roaring like mad.  Down comes of course the 
 eleven gals and old Shum.  There was a pretty row.  &quot;Look here,  sir,&quot; 
says she, &quot;at the conduck of your precious trull of a  daughter&#8212;alone 
with this man, kissin and dandlin, and Lawd knows  what besides.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What, he?&quot; cries Miss Betsy&#8212;&quot;he in love with Mary.  Oh, the 
 wretch, the monster, the deceiver!&quot;&#8212;and she falls down too, 
 screeching away as loud as her mamma; for the silly creature  fancied 
still that Altamont had a fondness for her. </P>
<P> &quot;SILENCE THESE WOMEN!&quot; shouts out Altamont, thundering loud.  &quot;I 
 love your daughter, Mr. Shum.  I will take her without a penny, and 
 can afford to keep her.  If you don't give her to me, she'll come  of 
her own will.  Is that enough?&#8212;may I have her?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;We'll talk of this matter, sir,&quot; says Mr. Shum, looking as high 
 and mighty as an alderman.  &quot;Gals, go up stairs with your dear 
 mamma.&quot;&#8212;And they all trooped up again, and so the skrimmage ended. </P>
<P> You may be sure that old Shum was not very sorry to get a husband 
 for his daughter Mary, for the old creatur loved her better than  all 
the pack which had been brought him or born to him by Mrs.  Buckmaster. 
 But, strange to say, when he came to talk of  settlements and so 
forth, not a word would my master answer.  He  said he made four 
hundred a year reglar&#8212;he wouldn't tell how&#8212;but  Mary, if she married 
him, must share all that he had, and ask no  questions; only this he 
would say, as he'd said before, that he was  a honest man. </P>
<P> They were married in a few days, and took a very genteel house at 
 Islington; but still my master went away to business, and nobody  knew 
where.  Who could he be? </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_1_3">CHAPTER III.</A></H3>
<P> If ever a young kipple in the middlin classes began life with a 
 chance of happiness, it was Mr. and Mrs. Frederic Altamont.  There 
 house at Cannon Row, Islington, was as comfortable as house could  be. 
 Carpited from top to to; pore's rates small; furnitur elygant;  and 
three deomestix: of which I, in course, was one.  My life  wasn't so 
easy as in Mr. A.'s bachelor days; but, what then?  The  three W's is 
my maxum: plenty of work, plenty of wittles, and  plenty of wages. 
 Altamont kep his gig no longer, but went to the  city in an 
omlibuster. </P>
<P> One would have thought, I say, that Mrs. A., with such an 
 effeckshnut husband, might have been as happy as her blessid  majisty. 
 Nothing of the sort.  For the fust six months it was all  very well; 
but then she grew gloomier and gloomier, though A. did  everythink in 
life to please her. </P>
<P> Old Shum used to come reglarly four times a wick to Cannon Row, 
 where he lunched, and dined, and teed, and supd.  The pore little  man 
was a thought too fond of wine and spirits; and many and many's  the 
night that I've had to support him home.  And you may be sure  that 
Miss Betsy did not now desert her sister: she was at our place 
 mornink, noon, and night; not much to my mayster's liking, though  he 
was too good-natured to wex his wife in trifles. </P>
<P> But Betsy never had forgotten the recollection of old days, and 
 hated Altamont like the foul feind.  She put all kind of bad things 
 into the head of poor innocent missis; who, from being all gayety  and 
cheerfulness, grew to be quite melumcolly and pale, and  retchid, just 
as if she had been the most misrable woman in the  world. </P>
<P> In three months more, a baby comes, in course, and with it old Mrs. 
 Shum, who stuck to Mrs.' side as close as a wampire, and made her 
 retchider and retchider.  She used to bust into tears when Altamont 
 came home: she used to sigh and wheep over the pore child, and say, 
 &quot;My child, my child, your father is false to me;&quot; or, &quot;your father 
 deceives me;&quot; or &quot;what will you do when your pore mother is no  more?&quot; 
or such like sentimental stuff. </P>
<P> It all came from Mother Shum, and her old trix, as I soon found 
 out.  The fact is, when there is a mistry of this kind in the  house, 
its a servant's DUTY to listen; and listen I did, one day  when Mrs. 
was cryin as usual, and fat Mrs. Shum a sittin consolin  her, as she 
called it: though, heaven knows, she only grew wuss and  wuss for the 
consolation. </P>
<P> Well, I listened; Mrs. Shum was a-rockin the baby, and missis cryin 
 as yousual. </P>
<P> &quot;Pore dear innocint,&quot; says Mrs. S., heavin a great sigh, &quot;you're 
 the child of a unknown father and a misrable mother.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Don't speak ill of Frederic, mamma,&quot; says missis; &quot;he is all 
 kindness to me.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;All kindness, indeed! yes, he gives you a fine house, and a fine 
 gownd, and a ride in a fly whenever you please; but WHERE DOES ALL 
 HIS MONEY COME FROM?  Who is he&#8212;what is he?  Who knows that he 
 mayn't be a murderer, or a housebreaker, or a utterer of forged 
 notes?  How can he make his money honestly, when he won't say where 
 he gets it?  Why does he leave you eight hours every blessid day,  and 
won't say where he goes to?  Oh, Mary, Mary, you are the most  injured 
of women!&quot; </P>
<P> And with this Mrs. Shum began sobbin; and Miss Betsy began yowling 
 like a cat in a gitter; and pore missis cried, too&#8212;tears is so 
 remarkable infeckshus. </P>
<P> &quot;Perhaps, mamma,&quot; wimpered out she, &quot;Frederic is a shop-boy, and 
 don't like me to know that he is not a gentleman.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;A shopboy,&quot; says Betsy, &quot;he a shopboy!  O no, no, no! more likely 
 a wretched willain of a murderer, stabbin and robing all day, and 
 feedin you with the fruits of his ill-gotten games!&quot; </P>
<P> More crying and screechin here took place, in which the baby 
 joined; and made a very pretty consort, I can tell you. </P>
<P> &quot;He can't be a robber,&quot; cries missis; &quot;he's too good, too kind, for 
 that: besides, murdering is done at night, and Frederic is always 
 home at eight.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But he can be a forger,&quot; says Betsy, &quot;a wicked, wicked FORGER. 
 Why does he go away every day? to forge notes, to be sure.  Why  does 
he go to the city? to be near banks and places, and so do it  more at 
his convenience.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But he brings home a sum of money every day&#8212;about thirty 
 shillings&#8212;sometimes fifty: and then he smiles, and says it's a  good 
day's work.  This is not like a forger,&quot; said pore Mrs. A. </P>
<P> &quot;I have it&#8212;I have it!&quot; screams out Mrs. S.  &quot;The villain&#8212;the 
 sneaking, double-faced Jonas! he's married to somebody else he is, 
 and that's why he leaves you, the base biggymist!&quot; </P>
<P> At this, Mrs. Altamont, struck all of a heap, fainted clean away. 
 A dreadful business it was&#8212;hystarrix; then hystarrix, in course, 
 from Mrs. Shum; bells ringin, child squalin, suvvants tearin up and 
 down stairs with hot water!  If ever there is a noosance in the 
 world, it's a house where faintain is always goin on.  I wouldn't 
 live in one,&#8212;no, not to be groom of the chambers, and git two 
 hundred a year. </P>
<P> It was eight o'clock in the evenin when this row took place; and 
 such a row it was, that nobody but me heard master's knock.  He  came 
in, and heard the hooping, and screeching, and roaring.  He  seemed 
very much frightened at first, and said, &quot;What is it?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Mrs. Shum's here,&quot; says I, &quot;and Mrs. in astarrix.&quot; </P>
<P> Altamont looked as black as thunder, and growled out a word which I 
 don't like to name,&#8212;let it suffice that it begins with a D and  ends 
with a NATION; and he tore up stairs like mad. </P>
<P> He bust open the bedroom door; missis lay quite pale and stony on 
 the sofy; the babby was screechin from the craddle; Miss Betsy was 
 sprawlin over missis; and Mrs. Shum half on the bed and half on the 
 ground: all howlin and squeelin, like so many dogs at the moond. </P>
<P> When A. came in, the mother and daughter stopped all of a sudding. 
 There had been one or two tiffs before between them, and they  feared 
him as if he had been a hogre. </P>
<P> &quot;What's this infernal screeching and crying about?&quot; says he.  &quot;Oh, 
 Mr. Altamont,&quot; cries the old woman, &quot;you know too well; it's about 
 you that this darling child is misrabble!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And why about me, pray, madam?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, sir, dare you ask why?  Because you deceive her, sir; because 
 you are a false, cowardly traitor, sir; because YOU HAVE A WIFE 
 ELSEWHERE, SIR!&quot;  And the old lady and Miss Betsy began to roar  again 
as loud as ever. </P>
<P> Altamont pawsed for a minnit, and then flung the door wide open; 
 nex he seized Miss Betsy as if his hand were a vice, and he world  her 
out of the room; then up he goes to Mrs. S.  &quot;Get up,&quot; says he, 
 thundering loud, &quot;you lazy, trolloping, mischsef-making, lying old 
 fool!  Get up, and get out of this house.  You have been the cuss  and 
bain of my happyniss since you entered it.  With your d&#8212;&#8212;d  lies, and 
novvle rending, and histerrix, you have perwerted Mary,  and made her 
almost as mad as yourself.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;My child! my child!&quot; shriex out Mrs. Shum, and clings round 
 missis.  But Altamont ran between them, and griping the old lady by 
 her arm, dragged her to the door.  &quot;Follow your daughter, ma'm,&quot;  says 
he, and down she went.  &quot;CHAWLS, SEE THOSE LADIES TO THE  DOOR,&quot; he 
hollows out, &quot;and never let them pass it again.&quot;  We  walked down 
together, and off they went: and master locked and  double-locked the 
bedroom door after him, intendin, of course, to  have a tator-tator (as 
they say) with his wife.  You may be sure  that I followed up stairs 
again pretty quick, to hear the result of  their confidence. </P>
<P> As they say at St. Stevenses, it was rayther a stormy debate. 
 &quot;Mary,&quot; says master, &quot;you're no longer the merry greatful gal I  knew 
and loved at Pentonwill: there's some secret a pressin on you&#8212; 
 there's no smilin welcom for me now, as there used formly to be!  Your 
mother and sister-in-law have perwerted you, Mary: and that's  why I've 
drove them from this house, which they shall not re-enter  in my life.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;O, Frederic! it's YOU is the cause, and not I.  Why do you have 
 any mistry from me?  Where do you spend your days?  Why did you  leave 
me, even on the day of your marridge, for eight hours, and  continue to 
do so every day?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Because,&quot; says he, &quot;I makes my livelihood by it.  I leave you, 
 and don't tell you HOW I make it: for it would make you none the 
 happier to know.&quot; </P>
<P> It was in this way the convysation ren on&#8212;more tears and questions 
 on my missises part, more sturmness and silence on my master's: it 
 ended for the first time since their marridge, in a reglar quarrel. 
 Wery difrent, I can tell you, from all the hammerous billing and 
 kewing which had proceeded their nupshuls. </P>
<P> Master went out, slamming the door in a fury; as well he might. 
 Says he, &quot;If I can't have a comforable life, I can have a jolly  one;&quot; 
and so he went off to the hed tavern, and came home that  evening 
beesly intawsicated.  When high words begin in a family  drink 
generally follows on the genlman's side; and then, fearwell  to all 
conjubial happyniss!  These two pipple, so fond and loving,  were now 
sirly, silent, and full of il wil.  Master went out  earlier, and came 
home later; missis cried more, and looked even  paler than before. </P>
<P> Well, things went on in this uncomfortable way, master still in the 
 mopes, missis tempted by the deamons of jellosy and curosity; until  a 
singlar axident brought to light all the goings on of Mr.  Altamont. </P>
<P> It was the tenth of January; I recklect the day, for old Shum gev 
 me half a crownd (the fust and last of his money I ever see, by the 
 way): he was dining along with master, and they were making merry 
 together. </P>
<P> Master said, as he was mixing his fifth tumler of punch and little 
 Shum his twelfth or so&#8212;master said, &quot;I see you twice in the City 
 to-day, Mr. Shum.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, that's curous!&quot; says Shum.  &quot;I WAS in the City.  To-day's 
 the day when the divvydins (God bless 'em) is paid; and me and Mrs. 
 S. went for our half-year's inkem.  But we only got out of the  coach, 
crossed the street to the Bank, took our money, and got in  agen.  How 
could you see me twice?&quot; </P>
<P> Altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd, and hawd.  &quot;O!&quot; says he, 
 &quot;I was passing&#8212;passing as you went in and out.&quot;  And he instantly 
 turned the conversation, and began talking about pollytix, or the 
 weather, or some such stuff. </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said my missis, &quot;but how could you see papa TWICE?&quot; 
 Master didn't answer, but talked pollytix more than ever.  Still  she 
would continy on.  &quot;Where was you, my dear, when you saw pa?  What were 
you doing, my love, to see pa twice?&quot; and so forth.  Master looked 
angrier and angrier, and his wife only pressed him  wuss and wuss. </P>
<P> This was, as I said, little Shum's twelfth tumler; and I knew 
 pritty well that he could git very little further; for, as reglar  as 
the thirteenth came, Shum was drunk.  The thirteenth did come,  and its 
consquinzes.  I was obliged to leed him home to John  Street, where I 
left him in the hangry arms of Mrs. Shum. </P>
<P> &quot;How the d&#8212;,&quot; sayd he all the way, &quot;how the d-dd&#8212;the deddy&#8212; 
 deddy&#8212;devil&#8212;could he have seen me TWICE?&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_1_4">CHAPTER IV.</A></H3>
<P> It was a sad slip on Altamont's part, for no sooner did he go out 
 the next morning than missis went out too.  She tor down the  street, 
and never stopped till she came to her pa's house at  Pentonwill.  She 
was clositid for an hour with her ma, and when she  left her she drove 
straight to the City.  She walked before the  Bank, and behind the 
Bank, and round the Bank: she came home  disperryted, having learned 
nothink. </P>
<P> And it was now an extraordinary thing that from Shum's house for 
 the next ten days there was nothing but expyditions into the city. 
 Mrs. S., tho her dropsicle legs had never carred her half so fur 
 before, was eternally on the key veve, as the French say.  If she 
 didn't go, Miss Betsy did, or misses did: they seemed to have an 
 attrackshun to the Bank, and went there as natral as an omlibus. </P>
<P> At last one day, old Mrs. Shum comes to our house&#8212;(she wasn't 
 admitted when master was there, but came still in his absints)&#8212;  and 
she wore a hair of tryumph, as she entered.  &quot;Mary,&quot; says she,  &quot;where 
is the money your husbind brought to you yesterday?&quot;  My  master used 
always to give it to missis when he returned. </P>
<P> &quot;The money, ma!&quot; says Mary.  &quot;Why here!&quot;  And pulling out her puss, 
 she showed a sovrin, a good heap of silver, and an odd-looking  little 
coin. </P>
<P> &quot;THAT'S IT! that's it!&quot; cried Mrs. S.  &quot;A Queene Anne's sixpence, 
 isn't it, dear&#8212;dated seventeen hundred and three?&quot; </P>
<P> It was so sure enough: a Queen Ans sixpence of that very date. </P>
<P> &quot;Now, my love,&quot; says she, &quot;I have found him!  Come with me to- 
 morrow, and you shall KNOW ALL!&quot; </P>
<P> And now comes the end of my story. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> The ladies nex morning set out for the City, and I walked behind, 
 doing the genteel thing, with a nosegy and a goold stick.  We  walked 
down the New Road&#8212;we walked down the City Road&#8212;we walked  to the 
Bank.  We were crossing from that heddyfiz to the other side  of 
Cornhill, when all of a sudden missis shreeked, and fainted 
 spontaceously away. </P>
<P> I rushed forrard, and raised her to my arms: spiling thereby a new 
 weskit and a pair of crimson smalcloes.  I rushed forrard.  I say, 
 very nearly knocking down the old sweeper who was hobbling away as 
 fast as posibil.  We took her to Birch's; we provided her with a 
 hackney-coach and every lucksury, and carried her home to Islington. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> That night master never came home.  Nor the nex night, nor the nex. 
 On the fourth day an octioneer arrived; he took an infantry of the 
 furnitur, and placed a bill in the window. </P>
<P> At the end of the wick Altamont made his appearance.  He was 
 haggard and pale; not so haggard, however, not so pale as his 
 miserable wife. </P>
<P> He looked at her very tendrilly.  I may say, it's from him that I 
 coppied MY look to Miss &#8212;&#8212;.  He looked at her very tendrilly and 
 held out his arms.  She gev a suffycating shreek, and rusht into  his 
umbraces. </P>
<P> &quot;Mary,&quot; says he, &quot;you know all now.  I have sold my place; I have 
 got three thousand pounds for it, and saved two more.  I've sold my 
 house and furnitur, and that brings me another.  We'll go abroad  and 
love each other, has formly.&quot; </P>
<P> And now you ask me, Who he was?  I shudder to relate.&#8212;Mr. 
Haltamont  SWEP THE CROSSING FROM THE BANK TO CORNHILL!! </P>
<P> Of cors, I left his servis.  I met him, few years after, at Badden- 
 Badden, where he and Mrs. A. were much respectid, and pass for  pipple 
of propaty. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_2">THE AMOURS OF MR. DEUCEACE.</A></H2>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_2_1">DIMOND CUT DIMOND.</A></H3>
<P> The name of my nex master was, if posbil, still more ellygant and 
 youfonious than that of my fust.  I now found myself boddy servant  to 
the Honrabble Halgernon Percy Deuceace, youngest and fifth son  of the 
Earl of Crabs. </P>
<P> Halgernon was a barrystir&#8212;that is, he lived in Pump Cort, Temple: 
 a wulgar naybrood, witch praps my readers don't no.  Suffiz to say, 
 it's on the confines of the citty, and the choasen aboad of the 
 lawyers of this metrappolish. </P>
<P> When I say that Mr. Deuceace was a barrystir, I don't mean that  he 
went sesshums or surcoats (as they call 'em), but simply that  he kep 
chambers, lived in Pump Cort, and looked out for a  commitionarship, or 
a revisinship, or any other place that the Wig  guvvyment could give 
him.  His father was a Wig pier (as the  landriss told me), and had 
been a Toary pier.  The fack is, his  lordship was so poar, that he 
would be anythink or nothink, to get  provisions for his sons and an 
inkum for himself. </P>
<P> I phansy that he aloud Halgernon two hundred a year; and it would 
 have been a very comforable maintenants, only he knever paid him. </P>
<P> Owever, the young genlmn was a genlmn, and no mistake; he got his 
 allowents of nothing a year, and spent it in the most honrabble  and 
fashnabble manner.  He kep a kab&#8212;-he went to Holmax&#8212;and 
 Crockfud's&#8212;he moved in the most xquizzit suckles and trubbld the  law 
boox very little, I can tell you.  Those fashnabble gents have  ways of 
getten money, witch comman pipple doan't understand. </P>
<P> Though he only had a therd floar in Pump Cort, he lived as if he 
 had the welth of Cresas.  The tenpun notes floo abowt as common as 
 haypince&#8212;clarrit and shampang was at his house as vulgar as gin;  and 
verry glad I was, to be sure, to be a valley to a zion of the

<P> Deuceace had, in his sittin-room, a large pictur on a sheet of 
 paper.  The names of his family was wrote on it; it was wrote in  the 
shape of a tree, a-groin out of a man-in-armer's stomick, and  the 
names were on little plates among the bows.  The pictur said  that the 
Deuceaces kem into England in the year 1066, along with  William 
Conqueruns.  My master called it his podygree.  I do bleev  it was 
because he had this pictur, and because he was the HONRABBLE  Deuceace, 
that he mannitched to live as he did.  If he had been a  common man, 
you'd have said he was no better than a swinler.  It's  only rank and 
buth that can warrant such singularities as my master  show'd.  For 
it's no use disgysing it&#8212;the Honrabble Halgernon was  a GAMBLER.  For 
a man of wulgar family, it's the wust trade that  can be&#8212;for a man of 
common feelinx of honesty, this profession is  quite imposbil; but for 
a real thoroughbread genlmn, it's the  esiest and most prophetable line 
he can take. </P>
<P> It may praps appear curious that such a fashnabble man should live 
 in the Temple; but it must be recklected, that it's not only  lawyers 
who live in what's called the Ins of Cort.  Many  batchylers, who have 
nothink to do with lor, have here their  loginx; and many sham 
barrysters, who never put on a wig and gownd  twise in their lives, kip 
apartments in the Temple, instead of Bon  Street, Pickledilly, or other 
fashnabble places. </P>
<P> Frinstance, on our stairkis (so these houses are called), there was 
 8 sets of chamberses, and only 3 lawyers.  These was bottom floar, 
 Screwson, Hewson, and Jewson, attorneys; fust floar, Mr. Sergeant 
 Flabber&#8212;opsite, Mr. Counslor Bruffy; and secknd pair, Mr. 
 Haggerstony, an Irish counslor, praktising at the Old Baly, and 
 lickwise what they call reporter to the Morning Post nyouspapper.

<PRE CLASS="poem">
          MR. RICHARD BLEWITT;</PRE>
<P> and on the thud floar, with my master, lived one Mr. Dawkins. </P>
<P> This young fellow was a new comer into the Temple, and unlucky it 
 was for him too&#8212;he'd better have never been born; for it's my firm 
 apinion that the Temple ruined him&#8212;that is, with the help of my 
 master and Mr. Dick Blewitt: as you shall hear. </P>
<P> Mr. Dawkins, as I was gave to understand by his young man, had just 
 left the Universary of Oxford, and had a pretty little fortn of his 
 own&#8212;six thousand pound, or so&#8212;in the stox.  He was jest of age,  an 
orfin who had lost his father and mother; and having  distinkwished 
hisself at Collitch, where he gained seffral prices,  was come to town 
to push his fortn, and study the barryster's  bisness. </P>
<P> Not bein of a very high fammly hisself&#8212;indeed, I've heard say his 
 father was a chismonger, or somethink of that lo sort&#8212;Dawkins was 
 glad to find his old Oxford frend, Mr. Blewitt, yonger son to rich 
 Squire Blewitt, of Listershire, and to take rooms so near him. </P>
<P> Now, tho' there was a considdrable intimacy between me and Mr. 
 Blewitt's gentleman, there was scarcely any betwixt our masters,&#8212; 
 mine being too much of the aristoxy to associate with one of Mr. 
 Blewitt's sort.  Blewitt was what they call a bettin man; he went 
 reglar to Tattlesall's, kep a pony, wore a white hat, a blue 
 berd's-eye handkercher, and a cut-away coat.  In his manners he was 
 the very contrary of my master, who was a slim, ellygant man as  ever 
I see&#8212;he had very white hands, rayther a sallow face, with  sharp dark 
ise, and small wiskus neatly trimmed and as black as  Warren's jet&#8212;he 
spoke very low and soft&#8212;he seemed to be watchin  the person with whom 
he was in convysation, and always flatterd  everybody.  As for Blewitt, 
he was quite of another sort.  He was  always swearin, singing, and 
slappin people on the back, as hearty  as posbill.  He seemed a merry, 
careless, honest cretur, whom one  would trust with life and soul.  So 
thought Dawkins, at least; who,  though a quiet young man, fond of his 
boox, novvles, Byron's poems,  foot-playing, and such like scientafic 
amusemints, grew hand in  glove with honest Dick Blewitt, and soon 
after with my master, the  Honrabble Halgernon.  Poor Daw! he thought 
he was makin good  connexions and real frends&#8212;he had fallen in with a 
couple of the  most etrocious swinlers that ever lived. </P>
<P> Before Mr. Dawkins's arrivial in our house, Mr. Deuceace had barely 
 condysended to speak to Mr. Blewitt; it was only about a month  after 
that suckumstance that my master, all of a sudding, grew very  friendly 
with him.  The reason was pretty clear,&#8212;Deuceace WANTED  HIM.  Dawkins 
had not been an hour in master's company before he  knew that he had a 
pidgin to pluck. </P>
<P> Blewitt knew this too: and bein very fond of pidgin, intended to 
 keep this one entirely to himself.  It was amusin to see the 
 Honrabble Halgernon manuvring to get this poor bird out of  Blewitt's 
clause, who thought he had it safe.  In fact, he'd  brought Dawkins to 
these chambers for that very porpos, thinking to  have him under his 
eye, and strip him at leisure. </P>
<P> My master very soon found out what was Mr. Blewitt's game. 
 Gamblers know gamblers, if not by instink, at least by reputation; 
 and though Mr. Blewitt moved in a much lower speare than Mr. 
 Deuceace, they knew each other's dealins and caracters puffickly 
 well. </P>
<P> &quot;Charles you scoundrel,&quot; says Deuceace to me one day (he always 
 spoak in that kind way), &quot;who is this person that has taken the  opsit 
chambers, and plays the flute so industrusly?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It's Mr. Dawkins, a rich young gentleman from Oxford, and a great 
 friend of Mr. Blewittses, sir,&quot; says I; &quot;they seem to live in each 
 other's rooms.&quot; </P>
<P> Master said nothink, but he GRIN'D&#8212;my eye, how he did grin.  Not 
 the fowl find himself could snear more satannickly. </P>
<P> I knew what he meant: </P>
<P> Imprimish.  A man who plays the floot is a simpleton. </P>
<P> Secknly.  Mr. Blewitt is a raskle. </P>
<P> Thirdmo.  When a raskle and a simpleton is always together, and 
 when the simpleton is RICH, one knows pretty well what will come of 
 it. </P>
<P> I was but a lad in them days, but I knew what was what, as well as 
 my master; it's not gentlemen only that's up to snough.  Law bless 
 us! there was four of us on this stairkes, four as nice young men  as 
you ever see: Mr. Bruffy's young man, Mr. Dawkinses, Mr.  Blewitt's, 
and me&#8212;and we knew what our masters was about as well  as thay did 
theirselfs.  Frinstance, I can say this for MYSELF,  there wasn't a 
paper in Deuceace's desk or drawer, not a bill, a  note, or mimerandum, 
which I hadn't read as well as he: with  Blewitt's it was the same&#8212;me 
and his young man used to read 'em  all.  There wasn't a bottle of wine 
that we didn't get a glass out  of, nor a pound of sugar that we didn't 
have some lumps of it.  We  had keys to all the cubbards&#8212;we pipped 
into all the letters that  kem and went&#8212;-we pored over all the 
bill-files&#8212;we'd the best  pickens out of the dinners, the livvers of 
the fowls, the forcemit  balls out of the soup, the egs from the 
sallit.  As for the coals  and candles, we left them to the landrisses. 
 You may call this  robry&#8212;nonsince&#8212;it's only our rights&#8212;a suvvant's 
purquizzits is  as sacred as the laws of Hengland. </P>
<P> Well, the long and short of it is this.  Richard Blewitt, esquire, 
 was sityouated as follows:  He'd an incum of three hundred a year 
 from his father.  Out of this he had to pay one hundred and ninety 
 for money borrowed by him at collidge, seventy for chambers,  seventy 
more for his hoss, aty for his suvvant on bord wagis, and  about three 
hundred and fifty for a sepparat establishment in the  Regency Park; 
besides this, his pockit-money, say a hunderd, his  eatin, drinkin, and 
wine-marchant's bill, about two hunderd moar.  So that you see he laid 
by a pretty handsome sum at the end of the  year. </P>
<P> My master was diffrent; and being a more fashnable man than Mr. B., 
 in course he owed a deal more mony.  There was fust: </P>

<P> I give this as a curosity&#8212;pipple doan't know how in many cases 
 fashnabble life is carried on; and to know even what a real gnlmn 
 OWES is somethink instructif and agreeable. </P>
<P> But to my tail.  The very day after my master had made the 
 inquiries concerning Mr. Dawkins, witch I mentioned already, he met 
 Mr. Blewitt on the stairs; and byoutiffle it was to see how this 
 gnlmn, who had before been almost cut by my master, was now  received 
by him.  One of the sweetest smiles I ever saw was now  vizzable on Mr. 
Deuceace's countenance.  He held out his hand,  covered with a white 
kid glove, and said, in the most frenly tone  of vice posbill, &quot;What! 
Mr. Blewitt?  It is an age since we met.  What a shame that such near 
naybors should see each other so  seldom!&quot; </P>
<P> Mr. Blewitt, who was standing at his door, in a pe-green dressing- 
 gown, smoakin a segar, and singing a hunting coarus, looked 
 surprised, flattered, and then suspicious. </P>
<P> &quot;Why, yes,&quot; says he, &quot;it is, Mr. Deuceace, a long time.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Not, I think, since we dined at Sir George Hookey's.  By-the-by, 
 what an evening that was&#8212;hay, Mr. Blewitt?  What wine! what  capital 
songs!  I recollect your 'May-day in the morning'&#8212;cuss me,  the best 
comick song I ever heard.  I was speaking to the Duke of  Doncaster 
about it only yesterday.  You know the duke, I think?&quot; </P>
<P> Mr. Blewitt said, quite surly, &quot;No, I don't.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Not know him!&quot; cries master; &quot;why, hang it, Blewitt! he knows YOU; 
 as every sporting man in England does, I should think.  Why, man, 
 your good things are in everybody's mouth at Newmarket.&quot; </P>
<P> And so master went on chaffin Mr. Blewitt.  That genlmn at fust 
 answered him quite short and angry: but, after a little more 
 flummery, he grew as pleased as posbill, took in all Deuceace's 
 flatry, and bleeved all his lies.  At last the door shut, and they 
 both went into Mr. Blewitt's chambers together. </P>
<P> Of course I can't say what past there; but in an hour master kem up 
 to his own room as yaller as mustard, and smellin sadly of backo 
 smoke.  I never see any genmln more sick than he was; HE'D BEEN 
 SMOAKIN SEAGARS along with Blewitt.  I said nothink, in course, tho 
 I'd often heard him xpress his horrow of backo, and knew very well  he 
would as soon swallow pizon as smoke.  But he wasn't a chap to  do a 
thing without a reason: if he'd been smoakin, I warrant he had  smoked 
to some porpus. </P>
<P> I didn't hear the convysation betwean 'em; but Mr. Blewitt's man 
 did: it was,&#8212;&quot;Well, Mr. Blewitt, what capital seagars!  Have you  one 
for a friend to smoak?&quot;  (The old fox, it wasn't only the  SEAGARS he 
was a-smoakin!)  &quot;Walk in,&quot; says Mr. Blewitt; and they  began a chaffin 
together; master very ankshous about the young  gintleman who had come 
to live in our chambers, Mr. Dawkins, and  always coming back to that 
subject,&#8212;saying that people on the same  stairkis ot to be frenly; how 
glad he'd be, for his part, to know  Mr. Dick Blewitt, and ANY FRIEND 
OF HIS, and so on.  Mr. Dick,  howsever, seamed quite aware of the trap 
laid for him.  &quot;I really  don't know this Dawkins,&quot; says he: he's a 
chismonger's son, I hear;  and tho I've exchanged visits with him, I 
doan't intend to  continyou the acquaintance,&#8212;not wishin to assoshate 
with that kind  of pipple.&quot;  So they went on, master fishin, and Mr. 
Blewitt not  wishin to take the hook at no price. </P>
<P> &quot;Confound the vulgar thief!&quot; muttard my master, as he was laying on 
 his sophy, after being so very ill; &quot;I've poisoned myself with his 
 infernal tobacco, and he has foiled me.  The cursed swindling boor! 
 he thinks he'll ruin this poor Cheese-monger, does he?  I'll step  in, 
and WARN him.&quot; </P>
<P> I thought I should bust a-laffin, when he talked in this style.  I 
 knew very well what his &quot;warning&quot; meant,&#8212;lockin the stable-door  but 
stealin the hoss fust. </P>
<P> Next day, his strattygam for becoming acquainted with Mr. Dawkins 
 we exicuted; and very pritty it was. </P>
<P> Besides potry and the flute, Mr. Dawkins, I must tell you, had some 
 other parshallities&#8212;wiz., he was very fond of good eatin and 
 drinkin.  After doddling over his music and boox all day, this  young 
genlmn used to sally out of evenings, dine sumptiously at a  tavern, 
drinkin all sorts of wine along with his friend Mr.  Blewitt.  He was a 
quiet young fellow enough at fust; but it was  Mr. B. who (for his own 
porpuses, no doubt,) had got him into this  kind of life.  Well, I 
needn't say that he who eats a fine dinner,  and drinks too much 
overnight, wants a bottle of soda-water, and a  gril, praps, in the 
morning.  Such was Mr. Dawkinses case; and  reglar almost as twelve 
o'clock came, the waiter from &quot;Dix Coffy-  House&quot; was to be seen on our 
stairkis, bringing up Mr. D.'s hot  breakfast. </P>
<P> No man would have thought there was anythink in such a trifling 
 cirkumstance; master did, though, and pounced upon it like a cock  on 
a barlycorn. </P>
<P> He sent me out to Mr. Morell's in Pickledilly, for wot's called a 
 Strasbug-pie&#8212;in French, a &quot;patty defau graw.&quot;  He takes a card,  and 
nails it on the outside case (patty defaw graws come generally  in a 
round wooden box, like a drumb); and what do you think he  writes on 
it? why, as follos:&#8212;&quot;For the Honorable Algernon Percy  Deuceace,  With 
Prince Talleyrand's compliments.&quot; </P>
<P> Prince Tallyram's complimints, indeed!  I laff when I think of it, 
 still, the old surpint!  He WAS a surpint, that Deuceace, and no 
 mistake. </P>
<P> Well, by a most extrornary piece of ill-luck, the nex day 
 punctially as Mr. Dawkinses brexfas was coming UP the stairs, Mr. 
 Halgernon Percy Deuceace was going DOWN.  He was as gay as a lark, 
 humming an Oppra tune, and twizzting round his head his hevy gold- 
 headed cane.  Down he went very fast, and by a most unlucky axdent 
 struck his cane against the waiter's tray, and away went Mr. 
 Dawkinses gril, kayann, kitchup, soda-water and all!  I can't think 
 how my master should have choas such an exact time; to be sure, his 
 windo looked upon the court, and he could see every one who came  into 
our door. </P>
<P> As soon as the axdent had took place, master was in such a rage as, 
 to be sure, no man ever was in befor; he swoar at the waiter in the 
 most dreddfle way; he threatened him with his stick, and it was  only 
when he see that the waiter was rayther a bigger man than  hisself that 
he was in the least pazzyfied.  He returned to his own  chambres; and 
John, the waiter, went off for more gril to Dixes  Coffy-house. </P>
<P> &quot;This is a most unlucky axdent, to be sure, Charles,&quot; says master 
 to me, after a few minits paws, during witch he had been and wrote  a 
note, put it into an anvelope, and sealed it with his big seal of 
 arms.  &quot;But stay&#8212;a thought strikes me&#8212;take this note to Mr. 
 Dawkins, and that pye you brought yesterday; and hearkye, you 
 scoundrel, if you say where you got it I will break every bone in 
 your skin!&quot; </P>
<P> These kind of promises were among the few which I knew him to keep: 
 and as I loved boath my skinn and my boans, I carried the noat, and 
 of cors said nothink.  Waiting in Mr. Dawkinses chambus for a few 
 minnits, I returned to my master with an anser.  I may as well give 
 both of these documence, of which I happen to have taken coppies: </P>

                         II.</PRE>
<P> FROM T. S. DAWKINS, ESQ., TO THE HON. A. P. DEUCEACE. </P>
<P> &quot;MR. THOMAS SMITH DAWKINS presents his grateful compliments to the 
 Hon. Mr. Deuceace, and accepts with the greatest pleasure Mr. 
 Deuceace's generous proffer. </P>
<P> &quot;It would be one of the HAPPIEST MOMENTS of Mr. Smith Dawkins's 
 life, if the Hon. Mr. Deuceace would EXTEND HIS GENEROSITY still 
 further, and condescend to partake of the repast which his  MUNIFICENT 
POLITENESS has furnished. </P>
<P> &quot;TEMPLE, Tuesday.&quot; </P>
<P> Many and many a time, I say, have I grin'd over these letters, 
 which I had wrote from the original by Mr. Bruffy's copyin clark. 
 Deuceace's flam about Prince Tallyram was puffickly successful.  I 
 saw young Dawkins blush with delite as he red the note; he toar up 
 for or five sheets before he composed the answer to it, which was  as 
you red abuff, and roat in a hand quite trembling with pleasyer.  If 
you could but have seen the look of triumph in Deuceace's wicked  black 
eyes, when he read the noat!  I never see a deamin yet, but I  can 
phansy 1, a holding a writhing soal on his pitchfrock, and  smilin like 
Deuceace.  He dressed himself in his very best clothes,  and in he 
went, after sending me over to say that he would except  with pleasyour 
Mr. Dawkins's invite. </P>
<P> The pie was cut up, and a most frenly conversation begun betwixt 
 the two genlmin.  Deuceace was quite captivating.  He spoke to Mr. 
 Dawkins in the most respeckful and flatrin manner,&#8212;agread in every 
 think he said,&#8212;prazed his taste, his furniter, his coat, his 
 classick nolledge, and his playin on the floot; you'd have thought, 
 to hear him, that such a polygon of exlens as Dawkins did not 
 breath,&#8212;that such a modist, sinsear, honrabble genlmn as Deuceace 
 was to be seen nowhere xcept in Pump Cort.  Poor Daw was complitly 
 taken in.  My master said he'd introduce him to the Duke of 
 Doncaster, and heaven knows how many nobs more, till Dawkins was 
 quite intawsicated with pleasyour.  I know as a fac (and it pretty 
 well shows the young genlmn's carryter), that he went that very day 
 and ordered 2 new coats, on porpos to be introjuiced to the lords  in. </P>
<P> But the best joak of all was at last.  Singin, swagrin, and 
 swarink&#8212;up stares came Mr. Dick Blewitt.  He flung opn Mr.  Dawkins's 
door, shouting out, &quot;Daw my old buck, how are you?&quot; when,  all of a 
sudden, he sees Mr. Deuceace: his jor dropt, he turned  chocky white, 
and then burnin red, and looked as if a stror would  knock him down. 
 &quot;My dear Mr. Blewitt,&quot; says my master, smilin and  offring his hand, 
&quot;how glad I am to see you.  Mr. Dawkins and I  were just talking about 
your pony!  Pray sit down.&quot; </P>
<P> Blewitt did; and now was the question, who should sit the other 
 out; but law bless you! Mr. Blewitt was no match for my master: all 
 the time he was fidgetty, silent, and sulky; on the contry, master 
 was charmin.  I never herd such a flo of conversatin, or so many 
 wittacisms as he uttered.  At last, completely beat, Mr. Blewitt  took 
his leaf; that instant master followed him; and passin his arm  through 
that of Mr. Dick, led him into our chambers, and began  talkin to him 
in the most affabl and affeckshnat manner. </P>
<P> But Dick was too angry to listen; at last, when master was telling 
 him some long story about the Duke of Doncaster, Blewitt burst out&#8212; </P>
<P> A plague on the Duke of Doncaster!  Come, come, Mr. Deuceace, don't 
 you be running your rigs upon me; I ain't the man to be bamboozl'd  by 
long-winded stories about dukes and duchesses.  You think I  don't know 
you; every man knows you and your line of country.  Yes,  you're after 
young Dawkins there, and think to pluck him; but you  shan't,&#8212;no, by 
&#8212;&#8212; you shan't.&quot;  (The reader must recklect that  the oaths which 
interspussed Mr. B.'s convysation I have left out.)  Well, after he'd 
fired a wolley of 'em, Mr. Deuceace spoke as cool  as possbill. </P>
<P> &quot;Hark ye, Blewitt.  I know you to be one of the most infernal 
 thieves and scoundrels unhung.  If you attempt to hector with me, I 
 will cane you; if you want more, I'll shoot you; if you meddle 
 between me and Dawkins, I will do both.  I know your whole life,  you 
miserable swindler and coward.  I know you have already won two 
 hundred pounds of this lad, and want all.  I will have half, or you 
 never shall have a penny.&quot;  It's quite true that master knew  things; 
but how was the wonder. </P>
<P> I couldn't see Mr. B.'s face during this dialogue, bein on the 
 wrong side of the door; but there was a considdrable paws after  thuse 
complymints had passed between the two genlmn,&#8212;one walkin  quickly up 
and down the room&#8212;tother, angry and stupid, sittin  down, and stampin 
with his foot. </P>
<P> &quot;Now listen to this, Mr. Blewitt,&quot; continues master at last.  &quot;If 
 you're quiet, you shall have half this fellow's money: but venture  to 
win a shilling from him in my absence, or without my consent,  and you 
do it at your peril.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, well, Mr. Deuceace,&quot; cries Dick, &quot;it's very hard, and I must 
 say, not fair: the game was of my startin, and you've no right to 
 interfere with my friend.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Blewitt, you are a fool!  You professed yesterday not to know 
 this man, and I was obliged to find him out for myself.  I should 
 like to know by what law of honor I am bound to give him up to  you?&quot; </P>
<P> It was charmin to hear this pair of raskles talkin about HONOR.  I 
 declare I could have found it in my heart to warn young Dawkins of 
 the precious way in which these chaps were going to serve him.  But 
 if THEY didn't know what honor was, I did; and never, never did I 
 tell tails about my masters when in their sarvice&#8212;OUT, in cors,  the 
hobligation is no longer binding. </P>
<P> Well, the nex day there was a gran dinner at our chambers.  White 
 soop, turbit, and lobstir sos; saddil of Scoch muttn, grous, and 
 M'Arony; wines, shampang, hock, maderia, a bottle of poart, and  ever 
so many of clarrit.  The compny presint was three; wiz., the  Honrabble 
A. P. Deuceace, R. Blewitt, and Mr. Dawkins, Exquires.  My i, how we 
genlmn in the kitchin did enjy it.  Mr. Blewittes man  eat so much 
grous (when it was brot out of the parlor), that I  reely thought he 
would be sik; Mr. Dawkinses genlmn (who was only  abowt 13 years of 
age) grew so il with M'Arony and plumb-puddn, as  to be obleeged to 
take sefral of Mr. D's. pils, which 1/2 kild him.  But this is all 
promiscuous: I an't talkin of the survants now, but  the masters. </P>
<P> Would you bleeve it?  After dinner and praps 8 bottles of wine 
 between the 3, the genlm sat down to ecarty.  It's a game where  only 
2 plays, and where, in coarse, when there's only 3, one looks  on. </P>
<P> Fust, they playd crown pints, and a pound the bett.  At this game 
 they were wonderful equill; and about supper-time (when grilled am, 
 more shampang, devld biskits, and other things, was brot in) the  play 
stood thus: Mr. Dawkins had won 2 pounds; Mr. Blewitt 30  shillings; 
the Honrabble Mr. Deuceace having lost 3L. l0s.  After  the devvle and 
the shampang the play was a little higher.  Now it  was pound pints, 
and five pound the bet.  I thought, to be sure,  after hearing the 
complymints between Blewitt and master in the  morning, that now poor 
Dawkins's time was come. </P>
<P> Not so: Dawkins won always, Mr. B. betting on his play, and giving 
 him the very best of advice.  At the end of the evening (which was 
 abowt five o'clock the nex morning) they stopt.  Master was  counting 
up the skore on a card. </P>
<P> &quot;Blewitt,&quot; says he, &quot;I've been unlucky.  I owe you, let me see&#8212; 
 yes, five-and-forty pounds?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Five-and-forty,&quot; says Blewitt, &quot;and no mistake!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I will give you a cheque,&quot; says the honrabble genlmn. </P>
<P> &quot;Oh! don't mention it, my dear sir!&quot;  But master got a grate sheet 
 of paper, and drew him a check on Messeers. Pump, Algit and Co.,  his 
bankers. </P>
<P> &quot;Now,&quot; says master, &quot;I've got to settle with you, my dear Mr. 
 Dawkins.  If you had backd your luck, I should have owed you a very 
 handsome sum of money.  Voyons, thirteen points at a pound&#8212;it is 
 easy to calculate;&quot; and drawin out his puss, he clinked over the 
 table 13 goolden suverings, which shon till they made my eyes wink. </P>
<P> So did pore Dawkinses, as he put out his hand, all trembling, and 
 drew them in. </P>
<P> &quot;Let me say,&quot; added master, &quot;let me say (and I've had some little 
 experience), that you are the very best ecarte player with whom I 
 ever sat down.&quot; </P>
<P> Dawkinses eyes glissened as he put the money up, and said, &quot;Law, 
 Deuceace, you flatter me.&quot; </P>
<P> FLATTER him!  I should think he did.  It was the very think which 
 master ment. </P>
<P> &quot;But mind you, Dawkins,&quot; continyoud he, &quot;I must have my revenge; 
 for I'm ruined&#8212;positively ruined by your luck.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, well,&quot; says Mr. Thomas Smith Dawkins, as pleased as if he 
 had gained a millium, &quot;shall it be to-morrow?  Blewitt, what say 
 you?&quot; </P>
<P> Mr. Blewitt agreed, in course.  My master, after a little 
 demurring, consented too.  &quot;We'll meet,&quot; says he, &quot;at your  chambers. 
 But mind, my dear fello, not too much wine: I can't  stand it at any 
time, especially when I have to play ecarte with  YOU.&quot; </P>
<P> Pore Dawkins left our rooms as happy as a prins.  &quot;Here, Charles,&quot; 
 says he, and flung me a sovring.  Pore fellow! pore fellow! I knew 
 what was a-comin! </P>
<P> But the best of it was, that these 13 sovrings which Dawkins won, 
 MASTER HAD BORROWED THEM FROM MR. BLEWITT!  I brought 'em, with 7 
 more, from that young genlmn's chambers that very morning: for,  since 
his interview with master, Blewitt had nothing to refuse him. </P>
<P> Well, shall I continue the tail?  If Mr. Dawkins had been the least 
 bit wiser, it would have taken him six months befoar he lost his 
 money; as it was, he was such a confunded ninny, that it took him a 
 very short time to part with it. </P>
<P> Nex day (it was Thursday, and master's acquaintance with Mr. 
 Dawkins had only commenced on Tuesday), Mr. Dawkins, as I said, gev 
 his party,&#8212;dinner at 7.  Mr. Blewitt and the two Mr. D.'s as  befoar. 
 Play begins at 11.  This time I knew the bisness was  pretty serious, 
for we suvvants was packed off to bed at 2 o'clock.  On Friday, I went 
to chambers&#8212;no master&#8212;he kem in for 5 minutes  at about 12, made a 
little toilit, ordered more devvles and soda-  water, and back again he 
went to Mr. Dawkins's. </P>
<P> They had dinner there at 7 again, but nobody seamed to eat, for all 
 the vittles came out to us genlmn: they had in more wine though,  and 
must have drunk at least two dozen in the 36 hours. </P>
<P> At ten o'clock, however, on Friday night, back my master came to 
 his chambers.  I saw him as I never saw him before, namly reglar 
 drunk.  He staggered about the room, he danced, he hickipd, he  swoar, 
he flung me a heap of silver, and, finely, he sunk down  exosted on his 
bed; I pullin off his boots and close, and making  him comfrabble. </P>
<P> When I had removed his garmints, I did what it's the duty of every 
 servant to do&#8212;I emtied his pockits, and looked at his pockit-book 
 and all his letters: a number of axdents have been prevented that 
 way. </P>
<P> I found there, among a heap of things, the following pretty 
 dockyment&#8212; </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
           I. O. U.
            L4700.
      THOMAS SMITH DAWKINS.
      Friday, 16th January.</PRE>
<P> There was another bit of paper of the same kind&#8212;&quot;I. 0. U. four 
 hundred pounds: Richard Blewitt:&quot; but this, in corse, ment nothink. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> Nex mornin, at nine, master was up, and as sober as a judg.  He 
 drest, and was off to Mr. Dawkins.  At ten, he ordered a cab, and  the 
two gentlmn went together. </P>
<P> &quot;Where shall he drive, sir?&quot; says I. </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, tell him to drive to THE BANK.&quot; </P>
<P> Pore Dawkins! his eyes red with remors and sleepliss drunkenniss, 
 gave a shudder and a sob, as he sunk back in the wehicle; and they 
 drove on. </P>
<P> That day he sold out every hapny he was worth, xcept five hundred 
 pounds. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> Abowt 12 master had returned, and Mr. Dick Blewitt came stridin up 
 the stairs with a sollum and important hair. </P>
<P> &quot;Is your master at home?&quot; says he. </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; says I; and in he walks.  I, in coars, with my ear to 
 the keyhole, listning with all my mite. </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says Blewitt, &quot;we maid a pretty good night of it, Mr. 
 Deuceace.  Yu've settled, I see, with Dawkins.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Settled!&quot; says master.  &quot;Oh, yes&#8212;yes&#8212;I've settled with him.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Four thousand seven hundred, I think?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;About that&#8212;yes.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;That makes my share&#8212;let me see&#8212;two thousand three hundred and 
 fifty; which I'll thank you to fork out.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Upon my word&#8212;why&#8212;Mr. Blewitt,&quot; says master, &quot;I don't really 
 understand what you mean.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN!&quot; says Blewitt, in an axent such as I 
 never before heard.  &quot;You don't know what I mean!  Did you not 
 promise me that we were to go shares?  Didn't I lend you twenty 
 sovereigns the other night to pay our losings to Dawkins?  Didn't  you 
swear, on your honor as a gentleman, to give me half of all  that might 
be won in this affair?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Agreed, sir,&quot; says Deuceace; &quot;agreed.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, sir, and now what have you to say?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, THAT I DON'T INTEND TO KEEP MY PROMISE!  You infernal fool 
 and ninny! do you suppose I was laboring for YOU?  Do you fancy I  was 
going to the expense of giving a dinner to that jackass yonder,  that 
you should profit by it?  Get away, sir!  Leave the room, sir!  Or, 
stop&#8212;here&#8212;I will give you four hundred pounds&#8212;your own note  of 
hand, sir, for that sum, if you will consent to forget all that  has 
passed between us, and that you have never known Mr. Algernon 
 Deuceace.&quot; </P>
<P> I've seen pipple angery before now, but never any like Blewitt.  He 
 stormed, groaned, belloed, swoar!  At last, he fairly began 
 blubbring; now cussing and nashing his teeth, now praying dear Mr. 
 Deuceace to grant him mercy. </P>
<P> At last, master flung open the door (heaven bless us! it's well I 
 didn't tumble hed over eels into the room!), and said, &quot;Charles,  show 
the gentleman down stairs!&quot;  My master looked at him quite  steddy. 
 Blewitt slunk down, as misrabble as any man I ever see.  As for 
Dawkins, heaven knows where he was! </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> &quot;Charles,&quot; says my master to me, about an hour afterwards, &quot;I'm 
 going to Paris; you may come, too, if you please.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_2_2">FORING PARTS.</A></H3>
<P> It was a singular proof of my master's modesty, that though he had 
 won this andsome sum of Mr. Dawkins, and was inclined to be as 
 extravygant and osntatious as any man I ever seed, yet, when he 
 determined on going to Paris, he didn't let a single frend know of 
 all them winnings of his; didn't acquaint my Lord Crabs his father, 
 that he was about to leave his natiff shoars&#8212;neigh&#8212;didn't even so 
 much as call together his tradesmin, and pay off their little bills 
 befor his departure. </P>
<P> On the contry, &quot;Chawles,&quot; said he to me, &quot;stick a piece of paper on 
 my door,&quot; which is the way that lawyers do, &quot;and write 'Back at 
 seven' upon it.&quot;  Back at seven I wrote, and stuck it on our outer 
 oak.  And so mistearus was Deuceace about his continental tour (to 
 all except me), that when the landriss brought him her account for 
 the last month (amountain, at the very least, to 2L. 10s.), master 
 told her to leave it till Monday morning, when it should be  properly 
settled.  It's extrodny how ickonomical a man becomes,  when he's got 
five thousand lbs. in his pockit. </P>
<P> Back at 7 indeed!  At 7 we were a-roalin on the Dover Road, in the 
 Reglator Coach&#8212;master inside, me out.  A strange company of people 
 there was, too, in that wehicle,&#8212;3 sailors; an Italyin with his 
 music-box and munky; a missionary, going to convert the heathens in 
 France; 2 oppra girls (they call 'em figure-aunts), and the figure- 
 aunts' mothers inside; 4 Frenchmin, with gingybred caps and 
 mustashes, singing, chattering, and jesticklating in the most 
 vonderful vay.  Such compliments as passed between them and the 
 figure-aunts! such a munshin of biskits and sippin of brandy! such  &quot;O 
mong Jews,&quot; and &quot;O sacrrres,&quot; and &quot;kill fay frwaws!&quot;  I didn't 
 understand their languidge at that time, so of course can't  igsplain 
much of their conwersation; but it pleased me, nevertheless,  for now I 
felt that I was reely going into foring parts: which, ever  sins I had 
had any edication at all, was always my fondest wish.  Heavin bless us! 
thought I, if these are specimeens of all  Frenchmen, what a set they 
must be.  The pore Italyin's monky,  sittin mopin and meluncolly on his 
box, was not half so ugly, and  seamed quite as reasonabble. </P>
<P> Well, we arrived at Dover&#8212;&quot;Ship Hotel&quot; weal cutlets half a ginny, 
 glas of ale a shilling, glas of neagush, half a crownd, a  hapnyworth 
of wax-lites four shillings, and so on.  But master paid  without 
grumbling; as long as it was for himself he never minded  the expens: 
and nex day we embarked in the packit for Balong sir-  mare&#8212;which 
means in French, the town of Balong sityouated on the  sea.  I who had 
heard of foring wonders, expected this to be the  fust and greatest: 
phansy, then, my disapintment, when we got  there, to find this Balong, 
not situated on the sea, but on the  SHOAR. </P>
<P> But oh! the gettin there was the bisniss.  How I did wish for Pump 
 Court agin, as we were tawsing abowt in the Channel!  Gentle  reader, 
av you ever been on the otion?&#8212;&quot;The sea, the sea, the open  sea!&quot; as 
Barry Cromwell says.  As soon as we entered our little  wessel, and I'd 
looked to master's luggitch and mine (mine was rapt  up in a very small 
hankercher), as soon, I say, as we entered our  little wessel, as soon 
as I saw the waives, black and frothy, like  fresh drawn porter, 
a-dashin against the ribs of our galliant bark,  the keal like a wedge, 
splittin the billoes in two, the sales a-  flaffin in the hair, the 
standard of Hengland floating at the mask-  head, the steward a-getting 
ready the basins and things, the  capting proudly tredding the deck and 
giving orders to the salers,  the white rox of Albany and the 
bathin-masheens disappearing in the  distans&#8212;then, then I felt, for 
the first time, the mite, the  madgisty of existence.  Yellowplush my 
boy,&quot; said I, in a dialogue  with myself, &quot;your life is now about to 
commens&#8212;your carear, as a  man, dates from your entrans on board this 
packit.  Be wise, be  manly, be cautious, forgit the follies of your 
youth.  You are no  longer a boy now, but a FOOTMAN.  Throw down your 
tops, your  marbles, your boyish games&#8212;throw off your childish habbits 
with  your inky clerk's jackit&#8212;throw up your&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> Here, I recklect, I was obleeged to stopp.  A fealin, in the fust 
 place singlar, in the next place painful, and at last compleatly 
 overpowering, had come upon me while I was making the abuff speach, 
 and now I found myself in a sityouation which Dellixy for Bids me  to 
describe.  Suffis to say, that now I dixcovered what basins was  made 
for&#8212;that for many, many hours, I lay in a hagony of exostion,  dead to 
all intense and porpuses, the rain pattering in my face,  the salers 
tramplink over my body&#8212;the panes of purgatory going on  inside.  When 
we'd been about four hours in this sityouation (it  seam'd to me four 
ears), the steward comes to that part of the deck  where we servants 
were all huddled up together, and calls out  &quot;Charles!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says I, gurgling out a faint &quot;yes, what's the matter?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You're wanted.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Where?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Your master's wery ill,&quot; says he, with a grin. </P>
<P> &quot;Master be hanged!&quot; says I, turning round, more misrable than ever. 
 I woodn't have moved that day for twenty thousand masters&#8212;no, not 
 for the Empror of Russia or the Pop of Room. </P>
<P> Well, to cut this sad subjik short, many and many a voyitch have I 
 sins had upon what Shakspur calls the &quot;wasty dip,&quot; but never such a 
 retched one as that from Dover to Balong, in the year Anna Domino 
 1818.  Steemers were scarce in those days; and our journey was made 
 in a smack.  At last, when I was in a stage of despare and  exostion, 
as reely to phansy myself at Death's doar, we got to the  end of our 
journey.  Late in the evening we hailed the Gaelic  shoars, and 
hankered in the arbor of Balong sir-mare. </P>
<P> It was the entrans of Parrowdice to me and master: and as we 
 entered the calm water, and saw the comfrabble lights gleaming in  the 
houses, and felt the roal of the vessel degreasing, never was  two 
mortials gladder, I warrant, than we were.  At length our  capting drew 
up at the key, and our journey was down.  But such a  bustle and 
clatter, such jabbering, such shrieking and swaring,  such wollies of 
oafs and axicrations as saluted us on landing, I  never knew!  We were 
boarded, in the fust place, by custom-house  officers in cock-hats, who 
seased our luggitch, and called for our  passpots: then a crowd of 
inn-waiters came, tumbling and screaming  on deck&#8212;&quot;Dis way, sare,&quot; 
cries one; &quot;Hotel Meurice,&quot; says another;  &quot;Hotel de Bang,&quot; screeches 
another chap&#8212;the tower of Babyle was  nothink to it.  The fust thing 
that struck me on landing was a big  fellow with ear-rings, who very 
nigh knock me down, in wrenching  master's carpet-bag out of my hand, 
as I was carrying it to the  hotell.  But we got to it safe at last; 
and, for the fust time in  my life, I slep in a foring country. </P>
<P> I shan't describe this town of Balong, which, as it has been 
 visited by not less (on an avaridg) than two milliums of English 
 since I fust saw it twenty years ago, is tolrabbly well known 
 already.  It's a dingy melumcolly place, to my mind; the only thing 
 moving in the streets is the gutter which runs down 'em.  As for 
 wooden shoes, I saw few of 'em; and for frogs, upon my honor I  never 
see a single Frenchman swallow one, which I had been led to  beleave 
was their reg'lar, though beastly, custom.  One thing which  amazed me 
was the singlar name which they give to this town of  Balong.  It's 
divided, as every boddy knows, into an upper town  (sitouate on a 
mounting, and surrounded by a wall, or bullyvar) and  a lower town, 
which is on the level of the sea.  Well, will it be  believed that they 
call the upper town the Hot Veal, and the other  the Base Veal, which 
is on the contry, genrally good in France,  though the beaf, it must be 
confest, is excrabble. </P>
<P> It was in the Base Veal that Deuceace took his lodgian, at the 
 Hotel de Bang, in a very crooked street called the Rue del Ascew;  and 
if he'd been the Archbishop of Devonshire, or the Duke of  Canterbury, 
he could not have given himself greater hairs, I can  tell you. 
 Nothink was too fine for us now; we had a sweet of rooms  on the first 
floor, which belonged to the prime minister of France  (at least the 
landlord said they were the premier's); and the Hon.  Algernon Percy 
Deuceace, who had not paid his landriss, and came to  Dover in a coach, 
seamed now to think that goold was too vulgar for  him, and a carridge 
and six would break down with a man of his  weight.  Shampang flew 
about like ginger-pop, besides bordo,  clarit, burgundy, burgong, and 
other wines, and all the delixes of  the Balong kitchins.  We stopped a 
fortnit at this dull place, and  did nothing from morning till night 
excep walk on the bench, and  watch the ships going in and out of 
arber, with one of them long,  sliding opra-glasses, which they call, I 
don't know why, tallow-  scoops.  Our amusements for the fortnit we 
stopped here were boath  numerous and daliteful; nothink, in fact, 
could be more pickong, as  they say.  In the morning before breakfast 
we boath walked on the  Peer; master in a blue mareen jackit, and me in 
a slap-up new  livry; both provided with long sliding opra-glasses, 
called as I  said (I don't know Y, but I suppose it's a scientafick 
term)  tallow-scoops.  With these we igsamined, very attentively, the 
 otion, the sea-weed, the pebbles, the dead cats, the fishwimmin,  and 
the waives (like little children playing at leap-frog), which  came 
tumblin over 1 another on to the shoar.  It seemed to me as if  they 
were scrambling to get there, as well they might, being sick  of the 
sea, and anxious for the blessid, peaceable terry firmy. </P>
<P> After brexfast, down we went again (that is, master on his beat, 
 and me on mine,&#8212;for my place in this foring town was a complete 
 shinycure), and putting our tally-scoops again in our eyes, we 
 egsamined a little more the otion, pebbils, dead cats, and so on;  and 
this lasted till dinner, and dinner till bedtime, and bedtime  lasted 
till nex day, when came brexfast, and dinner, and tally-  scooping, as 
before.  This is the way with all people of this town,  of which, as 
I've heard say, there is ten thousand happy English,  who lead this 
plesnt life from year's end to year's end. </P>
<P> Besides this, there's billiards and gambling for the gentlemen, a 
 little dancing for the gals, and scandle for the dowygers.  In none 
 of these amusements did we partake.  We were a LITTLE too good to 
 play crown pints at cards, and never get paid when we won; or to go 
 dangling after the portionless gals, or amuse ourselves with slops 
 and penny-wist along with the old ladies.  No, no; my master was a 
 man of fortn now, and behayved himself as sich.  If ever he 
 condysended to go into the public room of the Hotel de Bang&#8212;the 
 French (doubtless for reasons best known to themselves) call this a 
 sallymanjy&#8212;he swoar more and lowder than any one there; he  abyoused 
the waiters, the wittles, the wines.  With his glas in his  i, he 
staired at every body.  He took always the place before the  fire.  He 
talked about &quot;my carridge,&quot; &quot;my currier,&quot; &quot;my servant;&quot;  and he did 
wright.  I've always found through life, that if you  wish to be 
respected by English people, you must be insalent to  them, especially 
if you are a sprig of nobiliaty.  We LIKE being  insulted by 
noblemen,&#8212;it shows they're familiar with us.  Law  bless us!  I've 
known many and many a genlmn about town who'd  rather be kicked by a 
lord than not be noticed by him; they've even  had an aw of ME, because 
I was a lord's footman.  While my master  was hectoring in the parlor, 
at Balong, pretious airs I gave myself  in the kitching, I can tell 
you; and the consequints was, that we  were better served, and moar 
liked, than many pipple with twice our  merit. </P>
<P> Deuceace had some particklar plans, no doubt, which kep him so long 
 at Balong; and it clearly was his wish to act the man of fortune 
 there for a little time before he tried the character of Paris.  He 
 purchased a carridge, he hired a currier, he rigged me in a fine  new 
livry blazin with lace, and he past through the Balong bank a  thousand 
pounds of the money he had won from Dawkins, to his credit  at a Paris 
house; showing the Balong bankers at the same time, that  he'd plenty 
moar in his potfolie.  This was killin two birds with  one stone; the 
bankers' clerks spread the nuse over the town, and  in a day after 
master had paid the money every old dowyger in  Balong had looked out 
the Crabs' family podigree in the Peeridge,  and was quite intimate 
with the Deuceace name and estates.  If  Sattn himself were a lord, I 
do beleave there's many vurtuous  English mothers would be glad to have 
him for a son-in-law. </P>
<P> Now, though my master had thought fitt to leave town without 
 excommunicating with his father on the subject of his intended 
 continental tripe, as soon as he was settled at Balong he roat my 
 Lord Crabbs a letter, of which I happen to have a copy.  It ran 
 thus:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;BOULOGNE, January 25. </P>
<P> &quot;MY DEAR FATHER,&#8212;I have long, in the course of my legal studies, 
 found the necessity of a knowledge of French, in which language all 
 the early history of our profession is written, and have determined 
 to take a little relaxation from chamber reading, which has  seriously 
injured my health.  If my modest finances can bear a two  months' 
journey, and a residence at Paris, I propose to remain  there that 
period. </P>
<P> &quot;Will you have the kindness to send me a letter of introduction to 
 Lord Bobtail, our ambassador?  My name, and your old friendship  with 
him, I know would secure me a reception at his house; but a  pressing 
letter from yourself would at once be more courteous, and  more 
effectual. </P>
<P> &quot;May I also ask you for my last quarter's salary?  I am not an 
 expensive man, my dear father, as you know; but we are no  chameleons, 
and fifty pounds (with my little earnings in my  profession) would 
vastly add to the agremens of my continental  excursion. </P>
<P> &quot;Present my love to all my brothers and sisters.  Ah! how I wish 
 the hard portion of a younger son had not been mine, and that I  could 
live without the dire necessity for labor, happy among the  rural 
scenes of my childhood, and in the society of my dear sisters  and you! 
 Heaven bless you, dearest father, and all those beloved  ones now 
dwelling under the dear old roof at Sizes. </P>
<P> &quot;Ever your affectionate son, </P>
<P> &quot;Algernon. </P>
<P> &quot;THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF CRABS,  </P>
<P> SIZES COURT, BUCKS.&quot; </P>
<P> To this affeckshnat letter his lordship replied, by return of 
 poast, as follos:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;MY DEAR ALGERNON,&#8212;Your letter came safe to hand and I enclose you 
 the letter for Lord Bobtail as you desire.  He is a kind man, and  has 
one of the best cooks in Europe. </P>
<P> &quot;We were all charmed with your warm remembrances of us, not having 
 seen you for seven years.  We cannot but be pleased at the family 
 affection which, in spite of time and absence, still clings so  fondly 
to home.  It is a sad, selfish world, and very few who have  entered it 
can afford to keep those fresh feelings which you have,  my dear son. </P>
<P> &quot;May you long retain them, is a fond father's earnest prayer.  Be 
 sure, dear Algernon, that they will be through life your greatest 
 comfort, as well as your best worldly ally; consoling you in 
 misfortune, cheering you in depression, aiding and inspiring you to 
 exertion and success. </P>
<P> &quot;I am sorry, truly sorry, that my account at Coutts's is so low, 
 just now, as to render a payment of your allowance for the present 
 impossible.  I see by my book that I owe you now nine quarters, or 
 450L.  Depend on it, my dear boy, that they shall be faithfully  paid 
over to you on the first opportunity. </P>
<P> &quot;By the way, I have enclosed some extracts from the newspapers, 
 which may interest you: and have received a very strange letter  from 
a Mr. Blewitt, about a play transaction, which, I suppose, is  the case 
alluded to in these prints.  He says you won 4700L. from  one Dawkins: 
that the lad paid it; that he, Blewitt, was to go what  he calls 
'snacks' in the winning; but that you refused to share the  booty.  How 
can you, my dear boy, quarrel with these vulgar people,  or lay 
yourself in any way open to their attacks?  I have played  myself a 
good deal, and there is no man living who can accuse me of  a doubtful 
act.  You should either have shot this Blewitt or paid  him.  Now, as 
the matter stands, it is too late to do the former;  and, perhaps, it 
would be Quixotic to perform the latter.  My  dearest boy! recollect 
through life that YOU NEVER CAN AFFORD TO BE  DISHONEST WITH A ROQUE. 
 Four thousand seven hundred pounds was a  great coup, to be sure. </P>
<P> &quot;As you are now in such high feather, can you, dearest Algernon! 
 lend me five hundred pounds?  Upon my soul and honor, I will repay 
 you.  Your brothers and sisters send you their love.  I need not  add, 
that you have always the blessings of your affectionate  father, </P>
<P> &quot;CRABS.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;P.S.&#8212;Make it 500, and I will give you my note-of-hand for a 
 thousand.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> I needn't say that this did not QUITE enter into Deuceace's 
 eyedears.  Lend his father 500 pound, indeed!  He'd as soon have  lent 
him a box on the year!  In the fust place, he hadn seen old  Crabs for 
seven years, as that nobleman remarked in his epistol; in  the secknd 
he hated him, and they hated each other; and nex, if  master had loved 
his father ever so much, he loved somebody else  better&#8212;his father's 
son, namely: and sooner than deprive that  exlent young man of a penny, 
he'd have sean all the fathers in the  world hangin at Newgat, and all 
the &quot;beloved ones,&quot; as he called  his sisters, the Lady Deuceacisses, 
so many convix at Bottomy Bay. </P>
<P> The newspaper parrografs showed that, however secret WE wished to 
 keep the play transaction, the public knew it now full well.  Blewitt, 
as I found after, was the author of the libels which  appeared right 
and left: </P>
<P> &quot;GAMBLING IN HIGH LIFE&#8212;the HONORABLE Mr. D&#8212;c&#8212;ce again!&#8212;This 
 celebrated whist-player has turned his accomplishments to some 
 profit.  On Friday, the 16th January, he won five thousand pounds 
 from a VERY young gentleman, Th-m-s Sm-th D-wk-ns, Esq., and lost  two 
thousand five hundred to R. Bl-w-tt, Esq., of the T-mple.  Mr.  D. very 
honorably paid the sum lost by him to the honorable whist-  player, but 
we have not heard that, BEFORE HIS SUDDEN TRIP TO  PARIS, Mr. D&#8212;uc&#8212;ce 
paid HIS losings to Mr. Bl-w-tt.&quot; </P>
<P> Nex came a &quot;Notice to Corryspondents:&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Fair Play asks us, if we know of the gambling doings of the 
 notorious Deuceace?  We answer, WE DO; and, in our very next  Number, 
propose to make some of them public.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> They didn't appear, however; but, on the contry, the very same 
 newspeper, which had been before so abusiff of Deuceace, was now  loud 
in his praise.  It said:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;A paragraph was inadvertently admitted into our paper of last 
 week, most unjustly assailing the character of a gentleman of high 
 birth and talents, the son of the exemplary E-rl of Cr-bs.  We  repel, 
with scorn and indignation, the dastardly falsehoods of the  malignant 
slanderer who vilified Mr. De&#8212;ce-ce, and beg to offer  that gentleman 
the only reparation in our power for having thus  tampered with his 
unsullied name.  We disbelieve the RUFFIAN and  HIS STORY, and most 
sincerely regret that such a tale, or SUCH A  WRITER, should ever have 
been brought forward to the readers of  this paper.&quot; </P>
<P> This was satisfactory, and no mistake: and much pleased we were at 
 the denial of this conshentious editor.  So much pleased that  master 
sent him a ten-pound noat, and his complymints.  He'd sent  another to 
the same address, BEFORE this parrowgraff was printed;  WHY, I can't 
think: for I woodn't suppose any thing musnary in a  littery man. </P>
<P> Well, after this bisniss was concluded, the currier hired, the 
 carridge smartened a little, and me set up in my new livries, we  bade 
ojew to Bulong in the grandest state posbill.  What a figure  we cut! 
and, my i, what a figger the postillion cut!  A cock-hat, a  jackit 
made out of a cow's skin (it was in cold weather), a pig-  tale about 3 
fit in length, and a pair of boots!  Oh, sich a pare!  A bishop might 
almost have preached out of one, or a modrat-sized  famly slep in it. 
 Me and Mr. Schwigshhnaps, the currier, sate  behind in the rumbill; 
master aloan in the inside, as grand as a  Turk, and rapt up in his 
fine fir-cloak.  Off we sett, bowing  gracefly to the crowd; the 
harniss-bells jinglin, the great white  hosses snortin, kickin, and 
squeelin, and the postilium cracking  his wip, as loud as if he'd been 
drivin her majesty the quean. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> Well, I shan't describe our voyitch.  We passed sefral sitties, 
 willitches, and metrappolishes; sleeping the fust night at Amiens, 
 witch, as everyboddy knows, is famous ever since the year 1802 for 
 what's called the Pease of Amiens.  We had some, very good, done  with 
sugar and brown sos, in the Amiens way.  But after all the  boasting 
about them, I think I like our marrowphats better. </P>
<P> Speaking of wedgytables, another singler axdent happened here 
 concarning them.  Master, who was brexfasting before going away,  told 
me to go and get him his fur travling-shoes.  I went and toald  the 
waiter of the inn, who stared, grinned (as these chaps always  do), 
said &quot;Bong&quot; (which means, very well), and presently came back. </P>
<P> I'M BLEST IF HE DIDN'T BRING MASTER A PLATE OF CABBITCH!  Would you 
 bleave it, that now, in the nineteenth sentry, when they say  there's 
schoolmasters abroad, these stewpid French jackasses are so 
 extonishingly ignorant as to call a CABBIDGE a SHOO!  Never, never 
 let it be said, after this, that these benighted, souperstitious, 
 misrabble SAVIDGES, are equill, in any respex, to the great  Brittish 
people.  The moor I travvle, the moor I see of the world,  and other 
natiums, I am proud of my own, and despise and deplore  the retchid 
ignorance of the rest of Yourup. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> My remarks on Parris you shall have by an early opportunity.  Me 
 and Deuceace played some curious pranx there, I can tell you. </P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_1">CHAPTER I. THE TWO BUNDLES OF HAY.</A>
</H3>
<P> Lieutenant-General Sir George Griffin, K.C.B., was about seventy- 
 five years old when he left this life, and the East Ingine army, of 
 which he was a distinguished ornyment.  Sir George's first  appearance 
in Injar was in the character of a cabbingboy to a  vessel; from which 
he rose to be clerk to the owners at Calcutta,  from which he became 
all of a sudden a capting in the Company's  service; and so rose and 
rose, until he rose to be a leftenant-  general, when he stopped rising 
altogether&#8212;hopping the twig of  this life, as drummers, generals, 
dustmen, and emperors must do. </P>
<P> Sir George did not leave any mal hair to perpetuate the name of 
 Griffin.  A widow of about twenty-seven, and a daughter avaritching 
 twenty-three, was left behind to deploar his loss, and share his 
 proppaty.  On old Sir George's deth, his interesting widdo and  orfan, 
who had both been with him in Injer, returned home&#8212;tried  London for a 
few months, did not like it, and resolved on a trip to  Paris; where 
very small London people become very great ones, if  they've money, as 
these Griffinses had.  The intelligent reader  need not be told that 
Miss Griffin was not the daughter of Lady  Griffin; for though 
marritches are made tolrabbly early in Injer,  people are not quite so 
precoashoos as all that: the fact is, Lady  G. was Sir George's second 
wife.  I need scarcely add, that Miss  Matilda Griffin wos the 
offspring of his fust marritch. </P>
<P> Miss Leonora Kicksey, a ansum, lively Islington gal, taken out to 
 Calcutta, and, amongst his other goods, very comfortably disposed  of 
by her uncle, Capting Kicksey, was one-and-twenty when she  married Sir 
George at seventy-one; and the 13 Miss Kickseys, nine  of whom kep a 
school at Islington (the other 4 being married  variously in the city), 
were not a little envius of my lady's luck,  and not a little proud of 
their relationship to her.  One of 'em,  Miss Jemima Kicksey, the 
oldest, and by no means the least ugly of  the sett, was staying with 
her ladyship, and gev me all the  partecklars.  Of the rest of the 
famly, being of a lo sort, I in  course no nothink; MY acquaintance, 
thank my stars, don't lie among  them, or the likes of them. </P>
<P> Well, this Miss Jemima lived with her younger and more fortnat 
 sister, in the qualaty of companion, or toddy.  Poar thing!  I'd a 
 soon be a gally slave, as lead the life she did!  Every body in the 
 house despised her; her ladyship insulted her; the very kitching  gals 
scorned and flouted her.  She roat the notes, she kep the  bills, she 
made the tea, she whipped the chocklate, she cleaned the  canary birds, 
and gev out the linning for the wash.  She was my  lady's walking 
pocket, or rettycule; and fetched and carried her  handkercher, or her 
smell-bottle, like a well-bred spaniel.  All  night, at her ladyship's 
swarries, she thumped kidrills (nobody  ever thought of asking HER to 
dance!); when Miss Griffing sung, she  played the piano, and was 
scolded because the singer was out of  tune; abommanating dogs, she 
never drove out without her ladyship's  puddle in her lap; and, 
reglarly unwell in a carriage, she never  got anything but the back 
seat.  Poar Jemima! I can see her now in  my lady's SECKND-BEST old 
clothes (the ladies'-maids always got the  prime leavings): a liloc 
sattn gown, crumpled, blotched, and  greasy; a pair of white sattn 
shoes, of the color of Inger rubber;  a faded yellow velvet hat, with a 
wreath of hartifishl flowers run  to sead, and a bird of Parrowdice 
perched on the top of it,  melumcolly and moulting, with only a couple 
of feathers left in his  unfortunate tail. </P>
<P> Besides this ornyment to their saloon, Lady and Miss Griffin kept a 
 number of other servants in the kitching; 2 ladies'-maids; 2  footmin, 
six feet high each, crimson coats, goold knots, and white  cassymear 
pantyloons; a coachmin to match; a page: and a Shassure,  a kind of 
servant only known among forriners, and who looks more  like a 
major-general than any other mortial, wearing a cock-hat, a  unicorn 
covered with silver lace, mustashos, eplets, and a sword by  his side. 
 All these to wait upon two ladies; not counting a host  of the fair 
sex, such as cooks, scullion, housekeepers, and so  forth. </P>
<P> My Lady Griffin's lodging was at forty pound a week, in a grand 
 sweet of rooms in the Plas Vandome at Paris.  And, having thus 
 described their house, and their servants' hall, I may give a few 
 words of description concerning the ladies themselves. </P>
<P> In the fust place, and in coarse, they hated each other.  My lady 
 was twenty-seven&#8212;a widdo of two years&#8212;fat, fair, and rosy.  A  slow, 
quiet, cold-looking woman, as those fair-haired gals  generally are, it 
seemed difficult to rouse her either into likes  or dislikes; to the 
former, at least.  She never loved any body but  ONE, and that was 
herself.  She hated, in her calm, quiet way,  almost every one else who 
came near her&#8212;every one, from her  neighbor, the duke, who had 
slighted her at dinner, down to John  the footman, who had torn a hole 
in her train.  I think this  woman's heart was like one of them 
lithograffic stones, you CAN'T  RUB OUT ANY THING when once it's drawn 
or wrote on it; nor could  you out of her ladyship's stone&#8212;heart, I 
mean&#8212;in the shape of an  affront, a slight, or real, or phansied 
injury.  She boar an  exlent, irreprotchable character, against which 
the tongue of  scandal never wagged.  She was allowed to be the best 
wife posbill&#8212;  and so she was; but she killed her old husband in two 
years, as  dead as ever Mr. Thurtell killed Mr. William Weare.  She 
never got  into a passion, not she&#8212;she never said a rude word; but 
she'd a  genius&#8212;a genius which many women have&#8212;of making A HELL of a 
 house, and tort'ring the poor creatures of her family, until they 
 were wellnigh drove mad. </P>
<P> Miss Matilda Griffin was a good deal uglier, and about as amiable 
 as her mother-in-law.  She was crooked, and squinted; my lady, to  do 
her justice, was straight, and looked the same way with her i's.  She 
was dark, and my lady was fair&#8212;sentimental, as her ladyship  was cold. 
 My lady was never in a passion&#8212;Miss Matilda always; and  awfille were 
the scenes which used to pass between these 2 women,  and the wickid, 
wickid quarls which took place.  Why did they live  together?  There 
was the mistry.  Not related, and hating each  other like pison, it 
would surely have been easier to remain  seprat, and so have detested 
each other at a distans. </P>
<P> As for the fortune which old Sir George had left, that, it was 
 clear, was very considrabble&#8212;300 thousand lb. at the least, as I 
 have heard say.  But nobody knew how it was disposed of.  Some said 
 that her ladyship was sole mistriss of it, others that it was 
 divided, others that she had only a life inkum, and that the money 
 was all to go (as was natral) to Miss Matilda.  These are subjix 
 which are not praps very interesting to the British public, but  were 
mighty important to my master, the Honrable Algernon Percy  Deuceace, 
esquire, barrister-at-law, etsettler, etsettler. </P>
<P> For I've forgot to inform you that my master was very intimat in 
 this house; and that we were now comfortably settled at the Hotel 
 Mirabew (pronounced Marobo in French), in the Rew delly Pay, at 
 Paris.  We had our cab, and two riding horses; our banker's book,  and 
a thousand pound for a balantz at Lafitt's; our club at the  corner of 
the Rew Gramong; our share in a box at the oppras; our  apartments, 
spacious and elygant; our swarries at court; our  dinners at his 
excellency Lord Bobtail's and elsewhere.  Thanks to  poar Dawkins's 
five thousand pound, we were as complete gentlemen  as any in Paris. </P>
<P> Now my master, like a wise man as he was, seaing himself at the 
 head of a smart sum of money, and in a country where his debts  could 
not bother him, determined to give up for the present every  think like 
gambling&#8212;at least, high play; as for losing or winning  a ralow of 
Napoleums at whist or ecarty, it did not matter;  it looks like money 
to do such things, and gives a kind of  respectabilaty.  &quot;But as for 
play, he wouldn't&#8212;oh no! not for  worlds!&#8212;do such a thing.&quot;  He HAD 
played, like other young men of  fashn, and won and lost [old fox! he 
didn't say he had PAID]; but  he had given up the amusement, and was 
now determined, he said, to  live on his inkum.  The fact is, my master 
was doing his very best  to act the respectable man: and a very good 
game it is, too; but it  requires a precious great roag to play it. </P>
<P> He made his appearans reglar at church&#8212;me carrying a handsome 
 large black marocky Prayer-book and Bible, with the psalms and 
 lessons marked out with red ribbings; and you'd have thought, as I 
 graivly laid the volloms down before him, and as he berried his  head 
in his nicely brushed hat, before service began, that such a  pious, 
proper morl, young nobleman was not to be found in the whole  of the 
peeridge.  It was a comfort to look at him.  Efry old tabby  and 
dowyger at my Lord Bobtail's turned up the wights of their i's  when 
they spoke of him, and vowed they had never seen such a dear, 
 daliteful, exlent young man.  What a good son he must be, they  said; 
and oh, what a good son-in-law!  He had the pick of all the  English 
gals at Paris before we had been there 3 months.  But,  unfortunately, 
most of them were poar; and love and a cottidge was  not quite in 
master's way of thinking. </P>
<P> Well, about this time my Lady Griffin and Miss G. made their 
 appearants at Parris, and master, who was up to snough, very soon 
 changed his noat.  He sate near them at chapple, and sung hims with 
 my lady: he danced with 'em at the embassy balls; he road with them 
 in the Boy de Balong and the Shandeleasies (which is the French  High 
Park); he roat potry in Miss Griffin's halbim, and sang jewets  along 
with her and Lady Griffin; he brought sweet-meats for the  puddle-dog; 
he gave money to the footmin, kissis and gloves to the  sniggering 
ladies'-maids; he was sivvle even to poar Miss Kicksey;  there wasn't a 
single soal at the Griffinses that didn't adoar this  good young man. </P>
<P> The ladies, if they hated befoar, you may be sure detested each 
 other now wuss than ever.  There had been always a jallowsy between 
 them: miss jellows of her mother-in-law's bewty; madam of miss's 
 espree: miss taunting my lady about the school at Islington, and my 
 lady sneering at miss for her squint and her crookid back.  And now 
 came a stronger caws.  They both fell in love with Mr. Deuceace&#8212;my 
 lady, that is to say, as much as she could, with her cold selfish 
 temper.  She liked Deuceace, who amused her and made her laff.  She 
 liked his manners, his riding, and his good loox; and being a 
 pervinew herself had a dubble respect for real aristocratick flesh 
 and blood.  Miss's love, on the contry, was all flams and fury.  She'd 
always been at this work from the time she had been at  school, where 
she very nigh run away with a Frentch master; next  with a footman 
(which I may say, in confidence, is by no means  unnatral or 
unusyouall, as I COULD SHOW IF I LIKED); and so had  been going on sins 
fifteen.  She reglarly flung herself at  Deuceace's head&#8212;such sighing, 
crying, and ogling, I never see.  Often was I ready to bust out laffin, 
as I brought master skoars of  rose-colored billydoos, folded up like 
cockhats, and smellin like  barber's shops, which this very tender 
young lady used to address  to him.  Now, though master was a 
scoundrill and no mistake, he was  a gentlemin, and a man of good 
breading; and miss CAME A LITTLE TOO  STRONG (pardon the wulgarity of 
the xpression) with her hardor and  attachmint, for one of his taste. 
 Besides, she had a crookid  spine, and a squint; so that (supposing 
their fortns tolrabbly  equal) Deuceace reely preferred the 
mother-in-law. </P>
<P> Now, then, it was his bisniss to find out which had the most money. 
 With an English famly this would have been easy: a look at a will  at 
Doctor Commons'es would settle the matter at once.  But this  India 
naybob's will was at Calcutty, or some outlandish place; and  there was 
no getting sight of a coppy of it.  I will do Mr.  Algernon Deuceace 
the justass to say, that he was so little musnary  in his love for Lady 
Griffin, that he would have married her  gladly, even if she had ten 
thousand pounds less than Miss Matilda.  In the meantime, his plan was 
to keep 'em both in play, until he  could strike the best fish of the 
two&#8212;not a difficult matter for a  man of his genus: besides, Miss was 
hooked for certain. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_2">CHAPTER II. &quot;HONOR THY FATHER.&quot;</A></H3>
<P> I said that my master was adoard by every person in my Lady 
 Griffin's establishmint.  I should have said by every person excep 
 one,&#8212;a young French gnlmn, that is, who, before our appearants,  had 
been mighty partiklar with my lady, ockupying by her side  exackly the 
same pasition which the Honrable Mr. Deuceace now held.  It was 
bewtiffle and headifying to see how coolly that young  nobleman kicked 
the poar Shevalliay de L'Orge out of his shoes, and  how gracefully he 
himself stept into 'em.  Munseer de L'Orge was a  smart young French 
jentleman, of about my master's age and good  looks, but not possest of 
half my master's impidince.  Not that  that quallaty is uncommon in 
France; but few, very few, had it to  such a degree as my exlent 
employer, Mr. Deuceace.  Besides De  L'Orge was reglarly and reely in 
love with Lady Griffin, and master  only pretending: he had, of coars, 
an advantitch, which the poor  Frentchman never could git.  He was all 
smiles and gaty, while  Delorge was ockward and melumcolly.  My master 
had said twenty  pretty things to Lady Griffin, befor the shevalier had 
finished  smoothing his hat, staring at her, and sighing fit to bust 
his  weskit.  O luv, luv!  THIS isn't the way to win a woman, or my 
 name's not Fitzroy Yellowplush!  Myself, when I begun my carear  among 
the fair six, I was always sighing and moping, like this poar 
 Frenchman.  What was the consquints?  The foar fust women I adoared 
 lafft at me, and left me for something more lively.  With the rest  I 
have edopted a diffrent game, and with tolerable suxess, I can  tell 
you.  But this is eggatism, which I aboar. </P>
<P> Well, the long and the short of it is, that Munseer Ferdinand 
 Hyppolite Xavier Stanislas, Shevalier de L'Orge, was reglar cut out 
 by Munseer Algernon Percy Deuceace, Exquire.  Poar Ferdinand did  not 
leave the house&#8212;he hadn't the heart to do that&#8212;nor had my  lady the 
desire to dismiss him.  He was usefle in a thousand  different ways, 
gitting oppra-boxes, and invitations to French  swarries, bying gloves, 
and O de Colong, writing French noats, and  such like.  Always let me 
recommend an English famly, going to  Paris, to have at least one young 
man of the sort about them.  Never mind how old your ladyship is, he 
will make love to you;  never mind what errints you send him upon, 
he'll trot off and do  them.  Besides, he's always quite and 
well-dresst, and never drinx  moar than a pint of wine at dinner, which 
(as I say) is a pint to  consider.  Such a conveniants of a man was 
Munseer de L'Orge&#8212;the  greatest use and comfort to my lady posbill; if 
it was but to laff  at his bad pronunciatium of English, it was 
somethink amusink; the  fun was to pit him against poar Miss Kicksey, 
she speakin French,  and he our naytif British tong. </P>
<P> My master, to do him justace, was perfickly sivvle to this poar 
 young Frenchman; and having kicked him out of the place which he 
 occupied, sertingly treated his fallen anymy with every respect and 
 consideration.  Poar modist, down-hearted little Ferdinand adoured  my 
lady as a goddice! and so he was very polite likewise to my 
 master&#8212;never venturing once to be jellows of him, or to question  my 
Lady Griffin's right to change her lover, if she choase to do  so. </P>
<P> Thus, then, matters stood; master had two strinx to his bo, and 
 might take either the widdo or the orfn, as he preferred: com bong 
 lwee somblay, as the Frentch say.  His only pint was to discover  how 
the money was disposed off, which evidently belonged to one or  other, 
or boath.  At any rate he was sure of one; as sure as any  mortal man 
can be in this sublimary spear, where nothink is suttin  except 
unsertnty. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> A very unixpected insident here took place, which in a good deal 
 changed my master's calkylations. </P>
<P> One night, after conducting the two ladies to the oppra, after 
 suppink of white soop, sammy-deperdrow, and shampang glassy (which 
 means eyced), at their house in the Plas Vandom, me and master  droav 
hoam in the cab, as happy as possbill. </P>
<P> &quot;Chawls you d&#8212;&#8212;d scoundrel,&quot; says he to me (for he was in an 
 exlent humer), &quot;when I'm married, I'll dubbil your wagis.&quot; </P>
<P> This he might do, to be sure, without injuring himself, seeing that 
 he had us yet never paid me any.  But, what then?  Law bless us! 
 things would be at a pretty pass if we suvvants only lived on our 
 WAGIS; our puckwisits is the thing, and no mistake. </P>
<P> I ixprest my gratitude as best I could; swoar that it wasn't for 
 wagis I served him&#8212;that I would as leaf weight upon him for  nothink; 
and that never, never, so long as I livd, would I, of my  own accord, 
part from such an exlent master.  By the time these two  spitches had 
been made&#8212;my spitch and his&#8212;we arrived at the &quot;Hotel  Mirabeu;&quot; 
which, us every body knows, ain't very distant from the  Plas Vandome. 
 Up we marched to our apartmince, me carrying the  light and the cloax, 
master hummink a hair out of the oppra, as  merry as a lark. </P>
<P> I opened the door of our salong.  There was lights already in the 
 room; an empty shampang bottle roalin on the floar, another on the 
 table; near which the sofy was drawn, and on it lay a stout old 
 genlmn, smoaking seagars as if he'd bean in an inn tap-room. </P>
<P> Deuceace (who abommunates seagars, as I've already shown) bust into 
 a furious raige against the genlmn, whom he could hardly see for  the 
smoak; and, with a number of oaves quite unnecessary to repeat,  asked 
him what bisniss he'd there. </P>
<P> The smoaking chap rose, and, laying down his seagar, began a ror of 
 laffin, and said, &quot;What!  Algy my boy! don't you know me?&quot; </P>
<P> The reader may praps recklect a very affecting letter which was 
 published in the last chapter of these memoars; in which the writer 
 requested a loan of five hundred pound from Mr. Algernon Deuceace, 
 and which boar the respected signatur of the Earl of Crabs, Mr. 
 Deuceace's own father.  It was that distinguished arastycrat who  was 
now smokin and laffin in our room. </P>
<P> My Lord Crabs was, as I preshumed, about 60 years old.  A stowt, 
 burly, red-faced, bald-headed nobleman, whose nose seemed blushing  at 
what his mouth was continually swallowing; whose hand, praps,  trembled 
a little; and whose thy and legg was not quite so full or  as steddy as 
they had been in former days.  But he was a  respecktabble, 
fine-looking old nobleman; and though it must be  confest, 1/2 drunk 
when we fust made our appearance in the salong,  yet by no means moor 
so than a reel noblemin ought to be. </P>
<P> &quot;What, Algy my boy!&quot; shouts out his lordship, advancing and seasing 
 master by the hand, &quot;doan't you know your own father?&quot; </P>
<P> Master seemed anythink but overhappy.  &quot;My lord,&quot; says he, looking 
 very pail, and speakin rayther slow, &quot;I didn't&#8212;I confess&#8212;the 
 unexpected pleasure&#8212;of seeing you in Paris.  The fact is, sir,  said 
he,&quot; recovering himself a little; &quot;the fact is, there was such  a 
confounded smoke of tobacco in the room, that I really could not  see 
who the stranger was who had paid me such an unexpected visit.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;A bad habit, Algernon; a bad habit,&quot; said my lord, lighting 
 another seagar: &quot;a disgusting and filthy practice, which you, my  dear 
child, will do well to avoid.  It is at best, dear Algernon,  but a 
nasty, idle pastime, unfitting a man as well for mental  exertion as 
for respectable society; sacrificing, at once, the  vigor of the 
intellect and the graces of the person.  By-the-by,  what infernal bad 
tobacco they have, too, in this hotel.  Could not  you send your 
servant to get me a few seagars at the Cafe de Paris?  Give him a 
five-franc piece, and let him go at once, that's a good  fellow.&quot; </P>
<P> Here his lordship hiccupt, and drank off a fresh tumbler of 
 shampang.  Very sulkily, master drew out the coin, and sent me on  the 
errint. </P>
<P> Knowing the Cafe de Paris to be shut at that hour, I didn't say a 
 word, but quietly establisht myself in the ante-room; where, as it 
 happened by a singler coinstdints, I could hear every word of the 
 conversation between this exlent pair of relatifs. </P>
<P> &quot;Help yourself, and get another bottle,&quot; says my lord, after a 
 sollum paws.  My poar master, the king of all other compnies in  which 
he moved, seamed here but to play secknd fiddill, and went to  the 
cubbard, from which his father had already igstracted two  bottils of 
his prime Sillary. </P>
<P> He put it down before his father, coft, spit, opened the windows, 
 stirred the fire, yawned, clapt his hand to his forehead, and  suttnly 
seamed as uneezy as a genlmn could be.  But it was of no  use; the old 
one would not budg.  &quot;Help yourself,&quot; says he again,  &quot;and pass me the 
bottil.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You are very good, father,&quot; says master; &quot;but really, I neither 
 drink nor smoke.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Right, my boy: quite right.  Talk about a good conscience in this 
 life&#8212;a good STOMACK is everythink.  No bad nights, no headachs&#8212;  eh? 
 Quite cool and collected for your law studies in the morning?&#8212;  eh?&quot; 
 And the old nobleman here grinned, in a manner which would  have done 
creddit to Mr. Grimoldi. </P>
<P> Master sate pale and wincing, as I've seen a pore soldier under the 
 cat.  He didn't anser a word.  His exlent pa went on, warming as he 
 continued to speak, and drinking a fresh glas at evry full stop. </P>
<P> &quot;How you must improve, with such talents and such principles!  Why, 
 Algernon, all London talks of your industry and perseverance:  you're 
not merely a philosopher, man; hang it! you've got the  philosopher's 
stone.  Fine rooms, fine horses, champagne, and all  for 200 a year!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I presume, sir,&quot; says my master, &quot;that you mean the two hundred a 
 year which YOU pay me?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;The very sum, my boy; the very sum!&quot; cries my lord, laffin as if 
 he would die.  &quot;Why, that's the wonder!  I never pay the two  hundred 
a year, and you keep all this state up upon nothing.  Give  me your 
secret, O you young Trismegistus!  Tell your old father how  such 
wonders can be worked, and I will&#8212;yes, then, upon my word, I 
 will&#8212;pay you your two hundred a year!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Enfin, my lord,&quot; says Mr. Deuceace, starting up, and losing all 
 patience, &quot;will you have the goodness to tell me what this visit 
 means?  You leave me to starve, for all you care; and you grow  mighty 
facetious because I earn my bread.  You find me in  prosperity, and&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Precisely, my boy; precisely.  Keep your temper, and pass that 
 bottle.  I find you in prosperity; and a young gentleman of your 
 genius and acquirements asks me why I seek your society?  Oh, 
 Algernon! Algernon! this is not worthy of such a profound 
 philosopher.  WHY do I seek you?  Why, because you ARE in  prosperity, 
O my son! else, why the devil should I bother my self  about you?  Did 
I, your poor mother, or your family, ever get from  you a single 
affectionate feeling?  Did we, or any other of your  friends or 
intimates, ever know you to be guilty of a single honest  or generous 
action?  Did we ever pretend any love for you, or you  for us? 
 Algernon Deuceace, you don't want a father to tell you  that you are a 
swindler and a spendthrift!  I have paid thousands  for the debts of 
yourself and your brothers; and, if you pay nobody  else, I am 
determined you shall repay me.  You would not do it by  fair means, 
when I wrote to you and asked you for a loan of money.  I knew you 
would not.  Had I written again to warn you of my  coming, you would 
have given me the slip; and so I came, uninvited,  to FORCE you to 
repay me.  THAT'S why I am here, Mr. Algernon; and  so help yourself 
and pass the bottle.&quot; </P>
<P> After this speach, the old genlmn sunk down on the sofa, and puffed 
 as much smoke out of his mouth as if he'd been the chimley of a 
 steam-injian.  I was pleased, I confess, with the sean, and liked  to 
see this venrabble and virtuous old man a-nocking his son about  the 
hed; just as Deuceace had done with Mr. Richard Blewitt, as  I've 
before shown.  Master's face was, fust, red-hot; next, chawk-  white: 
and then sky-blew.  He looked, for all the world, like Mr.  Tippy Cooke 
in the tragady of Frankinstang.  At last, he mannidged  to speek. </P>
<P> &quot;My lord,&quot; says he, &quot;I expected when I saw you that some such 
 scheme was on foot.  Swindler and spendthrift as I am, at least it  is 
but a family failing; and I am indebted for my virtues to my  father's 
precious example.  Your lordship has, I perceive, added  drunkenness to 
the list of your accomplishments, and, I suppose,  under the influence 
of that gentlemanly excitement, has come to  make these preposterous 
propositions to me.  When you are sober,  you will, perhaps, be wise 
enough to know, that, fool as I may be,  I am not such a fool as you 
think me; and that if I have got money,  I intend to keep it&#8212;every 
farthing of it, though you were to be  ten times as drunk, and ten 
times as threatening as you are now.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, well, my boy,&quot; said Lord Crabs, who seemed to have been half 
 asleep during his son's oratium, and received all his sneers and 
 surcasms with the most complete good-humor; &quot;well, well, if you  will 
resist, tant pis pour toi.  I've no desire to ruin you,  recollect, and 
am not in the slightest degree angry but I must and  will have a 
thousand pounds.  You had better give me the money at  once; it will 
cost you more if you don't.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Sir,&quot; says Mr. Deuceace, &quot;I will be equally candid.  I would not 
 give you a farthing to save you from&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> Here I thought proper to open the doar, and, touching my hat, said, 
 &quot;I have been to the Cafe de Paris, my lord, but the house is shut.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Bon: there's a good lad; you may keep the five francs.  And now, 
 get me a candle and show me down stairs.&quot; </P>
<P> But my master seized the wax taper.  &quot;Pardon me, my lord,&quot; says he. 
 &quot;What! a servant do it, when your son is in the room?  Ah, par 
 exemple, my dear father,&quot; said he, laughing, &quot;you think there is no 
 politeness left among us.&quot;  And he led the way out. </P>
<P> &quot;Good night, my dear boy,&quot; said Lord Crabs, </P>
<P> &quot;God bless you, sir,&quot; says he.  &quot;Are you wrapped warm?  Mind the 
 step!&quot; </P>
<P> And so this affeckshnate pair parted. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_3">CHAPTER III. MINEWVRING.</A></H3>
<P> Master rose the nex morning with a dismal countinants&#8212;he seamed to 
 think that his pa's visit boded him no good.  I heard him muttering 
 at his brexfast, and fumbling among his hundred pound notes; once  he 
had laid a parsle of them aside (I knew what he meant), to send  'em to 
his father.  &quot;But no,&quot; says he at last, clutching them all  up together 
again, and throwing them into his escritaw, &quot;what harm  can he do me? 
 If he is a knave, I know another who's full as  sharp.  Let's see if 
we cannot beat him at his own weapons.&quot;  With  that Mr. Deuceace drest 
himself in his best clothes, and marched  off to the Plas Vandom, to 
pay his cort to the fair widdo and the  intresting orfn. </P>
<P> It was abowt ten o'clock, and he propoased to the ladies, on seeing 
 them, a number of planns for the day's rackryation.  Riding in the 
 Body Balong, going to the Twillaries to see King Looy Disweet (who 
 was then the raining sufferin of the French crownd) go to chapple, 
 and, finely, a dinner at 5 o'clock at the Caffy de Parry; whents  they 
were all to adjourn, to see a new peace at the theatre of the  Pot St. 
Martin, called Sussannar and the Elders. </P>
<P> The gals agread to everythink, exsep the two last prepositiums. 
 &quot;We have an engagement, my dear Mr. Algernon,&quot; said my lady.  &quot;Look&#8212;a 
very kind letter from Lady Bobtail.&quot;  And she handed over  a pafewmd 
noat from that exolted lady.  It ran thus:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;FBG. ST. HONORE, Thursday, Feb. 15, 1817. </P>
<P> &quot;MY DEAR LADY GRIFFIN,&#8212;It is an age since we met.  Harassing 
 public duties occupy so much myself and Lord Bobtail, that we have 
 scarce time to see our private friends; among whom, I hope, my dear 
 Lady Griffin will allow me to rank her.  Will you excuse so 
 unceremonious an invitation, and dine with us at the embassy to-  day? 
 We shall be en petite comite, and shall have the pleasure of  hearing, 
I hope, some of your charming daughter's singing in the  evening.  I 
ought, perhaps, to have addressed a separate, note to  dear Miss 
Griffin; but I hope she will pardon a poor diplomate, who  has so many 
letters to write, you know. </P>
<P> &quot;Farewell till seven, when I POSITIVELY MUST see you both.  Ever, 
 dearest Lady Griffin, your affectionate </P>
<P> &quot;ELIZA BOBTAIL.&quot; </P>
<P> Such a letter from the ambassdriss, brot by the ambasdor's 
 Shassure, and sealed with his seal of arms, would affect anybody in 
 the middling ranx of life.  It droav Lady Griffin mad with delight; 
 and, long before my master's arrivle, she'd sent Mortimer and 
 Fitzclarence, her two footmin, along with a polite reply in the 
 affummatiff. </P>
<P> Master read the noat with no such fealinx of joy.  He felt that 
 there was somethink a-going on behind the seans, and, though he  could 
not tell how, was sure that some danger was near him.  That  old fox of 
a father of his had begun his M'Inations pretty early! </P>
<P> Deuceace handed back the letter; sneared, and poohd, and hinted 
 that such an invitation was an insult at best (what he called a  pees 
ally); and, the ladies might depend upon it, was only sent  because 
Lady Bobtail wanted to fill up two spare places at her  table.  But 
Lady Griffin and Miss would not have his insinwations;  they knew too 
fu lords ever to refuse an invitatium from any one of  them.  Go they 
would; and poor Deuceace must dine alone.  After  they had been on 
their ride, and had had their other amusemince,  master came back with 
them, chatted, and laft; he was mighty  sarkastix with my lady; tender 
and sentrymentle with Miss; and left  them both in high sperrits to 
perform their twollet, before dinner. </P>
<P> As I came to the door (for I was as famillyer as a servnt of the 
 house), as I came into the drawing-room to announts his cab, I saw 
 master very quietly taking his pocket-book (or pot fool, as the 
 French call it) and thrusting it under one of the cushinx of the 
 sofa.  What game is this? thinx I. </P>
<P> Why, this was the game.  In abowt two hours, when he knew the 
 ladies were gon, he pretends to be vastly anxious abowt the loss of 
 his potfolio; and back he goes to Lady Griffinses to seek for it 
 there. </P>
<P> &quot;Pray,&quot; says he, on going in, &quot;ask Miss Kicksey if I may see her 
 for a single moment.&quot;  And down comes Miss Kicksey, quite smiling, 
 and happy to see him. </P>
<P> &quot;Law, Mr. Deuceace!&quot; says she, trying to blush as hard as ever she 
 could, &quot;you quite surprise me!  I don't know whether I ought,  really, 
being alone, to admit a gentleman.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Nay, don't say so, dear Miss Kicksey! for do you know, I came here 
 for a double purpose&#8212;to ask about a pocket-book which I have lost, 
 and may, perhaps, have left here; and then, to ask you if you will 
 have the great goodness to pity a solitary bachelor, and give him a 
 cup of your nice tea?&quot; </P>
<P> NICE TEA!  I thot I should have split; for I'm blest if master had 
 eaten a morsle of dinner! </P>
<P> Never mind: down to tea they sat.  &quot;Do you take cream and sugar, 
 dear sir?&quot; says poar Kicksey, with a voice as tender as a tuttle- 
 duff. </P>
<P> &quot;Both, dearest Miss Kicksey!&quot; answers master; who stowed in a power 
 of sashong and muffinx which would have done honor to a washawoman. </P>
<P> I shan't describe the conversation that took place betwigst master 
 and this young lady.  The reader, praps, knows y Deuceace took the 
 trouble to talk to her for an hour, and to swallow all her tea.  He 
 wanted to find out from her all she knew about the famly money 
 matters, and settle at once which of the two Griffinses he should 
 marry. </P>
<P> The poar thing, of cors, was no match for such a man as my master. 
 In a quarter of an hour, he had, if I may use the igspression, 
 &quot;turned her inside out.&quot;  He knew everything that she knew; and  that, 
poar creature, was very little.  There was nine thousand a  year, she 
had heard say, in money, in houses, in banks in Injar,  and what not. 
 Boath the ladies signed papers for selling or  buying, and the money 
seemed equilly divided betwigst them. </P>
<P> NINE THOUSAND A YEAR!  Deuceace went away, his cheex tingling, his 
 heart beating.  He, without a penny, could nex morning, if he  liked, 
be master of five thousand per hannum! </P>
<P> Yes.  But how?  Which had the money, the mother or the daughter? 
 All the tea-drinking had not taught him this piece of nollidge; and 
 Deuceace thought it a pity that he could not marry both. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> The ladies came back at night, mightaly pleased with their 
 reception at the ambasdor's; and, stepping out of their carridge,  bid 
coachmin drive on with a gentlemin who had handed them out&#8212;a  stout 
old gentlemin, who shook hands most tenderly at parting, and  promised 
to call often upon my Lady Griffin.  He was so polite,  that he wanted 
to mount the stairs with her ladyship; but no, she  would not suffer 
it.  &quot;Edward,&quot; says she to the coachmin, quite  loud, and pleased that 
all the people in the hotel should hear her,  &quot;you will take the 
carriage, and drive HIS LORDSHIP home.&quot;  Now,  can you guess who his 
lordship was?  The Right Hon. the Earl of  Crabs, to be sure; the very 
old genlmn whom I had seen on such  charming terms with his son the day 
before.  Master knew this the  nex day, and began to think he had been 
a fool to deny his pa the  thousand pound. </P>
<P> Now, though the suckmstansies of the dinner at the ambasdor's only 
 came to my years some time after, I may as well relate 'em here,  word 
for word, as they was told me by the very genlmn who waited  behind 
Lord Crabseses chair. </P>
<P> There was only a &quot;petty comity&quot; at dinner, as Lady Bobtail said; 
 and my Lord Crabs was placed betwigst the two Griffinses, being 
 mighty ellygant and palite to both.  &quot;Allow me,&quot; says he to Lady G. 
 (between the soop and the fish), &quot;my dear madam, to thank you&#8212; 
 fervently thank you for your goodness to my poor boy.  Your  ladyship 
is too young to experience, but, I am sure, far too tender  not to 
understand the gratitude which must fill a fond parent's  heart for 
kindness shown to his child.  Believe me,&quot; says my lord,  looking her 
full and tenderly in the face, &quot;that the favors you  have done to 
another have been done equally to myself, and awaken  in my bosom the 
same grateful and affectionate feelings with which  you have already 
inspired my son Algernon.&quot; </P>
<P> Lady Griffin blusht, and droopt her head till her ringlets fell 
 into her fish-plate: and she swallowed Lord Crabs's flumry just as 
 she would so many musharuins.  My lord (whose powers of slack-jaw  was 
notoarious) nex addrast another spitch to Miss Griffin.  He  said he'd 
heard how Deuceace was SITUATED.  Miss blusht&#8212;what a  happy dog he 
was&#8212;Miss blusht crimson, and then he sighed deeply,  and began eating 
his turbat and lobster sos.  Master was a good un  at flumry, but, law 
bless you! he was no moar equill to the old man  than a mole-hill is to 
a mounting.  Before the night was over, he  had made as much progress 
as another man would in a ear.  One  almost forgot his red nose and his 
big stomick, and his wicked  leering i's, in his gentle insiniwating 
woice, his fund of  annygoats, and, above all, the bewtific, morl, 
religious, and  honrabble toan of his genral conservation.  Praps you 
will say that  these ladies were, for such rich pipple, mightaly esaly 
captivated;  but recklect, my dear sir, that they were fresh from 
Injar,&#8212;that  they'd not sean many lords,&#8212;that they adoared the 
peeridge, as  every honest woman does in England who has proper 
feelinx, and has  read the fashnabble novvles,&#8212;and that here at Paris 
was their fust  step into fashnabble sosiaty. </P>
<P> Well, after dinner, while Miss Matilda was singing &quot;Die tantie,&quot; or 
 &quot;Dip your chair,&quot; or some of them sellabrated Italyian hairs (when 
 she began this squall, hang me if she'd ever stop), my lord gets  hold 
of Lady Griffin again, and gradgaly begins to talk to her in a  very 
different strane. </P>
<P> &quot;What a blessing it is for us all,&quot; says he, &quot;that Algernon has 
 found a friend so respectable as your ladyship.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Indeed, my lord; and why?  I suppose I am not the only respectable 
 friend that Mr. Deuceace has?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No, surely; not the only one he HAS HAD: his birth, and, permit me 
 to say, his relationship to myself, have procured him many.  But&#8212;&quot; 
 (here my lord heaved a very affecting and large sigh). </P>
<P> &quot;But what?&quot; says my lady, laffing at the igspression of his dismal 
 face.  &quot;You don't mean that Mr. Deuceace has lost them or is  unworthy 
of them?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I trust not, my dear madam, I trust not; but he is wild, 
 thoughtless, extravagant, and embarrassed: and you know a man under 
 these circumstances is not very particular as to his associates.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Embarrassed?  Good heavens!  He says he has two thousand a year 
 left him by a god-mother; and he does not seem even to spend his 
 income&#8212;a very handsome independence, too, for a bachelor.&quot; </P>
<P> My lord nodded his head sadly, and said,&#8212;&quot;Will your ladyship give 
 me your word of honor to be secret?  My son has but a thousand a 
 year, which I allow him, and is heavily in debt.  He has played, 
 madam, I fear; and for this reason I am so glad to hear that he is  in 
a respectable domestic circle, where he may learn, in the  presence of 
far greater and purer attractions, to forget the dice-  box, and the 
low company which has been his bane.&quot; </P>
<P> My Lady Griffin looked very grave indeed.  Was it true?  Was 
 Deuceace sincere in his professions of love, or was he only a  sharper 
wooing her for her money?  Could she doubt her informer?  his own 
father, and, what's more, a real flesh and blood pear of  parlyment? 
 She determined she would try him.  Praps she did not  know she had 
liked Deuceace so much, until she kem to feel how much  she should HATE 
him if she found he'd been playing her false. </P>
<P> The evening was over, and back they came, as wee've seen,&#8212;my lord 
 driving home in my lady's carridge, her ladyship and Miss walking  up 
stairs to their own apartmince. </P>
<P> Here, for a wonder, was poar Miss Kicksey quite happy and smiling, 
 and evidently full of a secret,&#8212;something mighty pleasant, to  judge 
from her loox.  She did not long keep it.  As she was making  tea for 
the ladies (for in that house they took a cup regular  before bedtime), 
&quot;Well, my lady,&quot; says she, &quot;who do you think has  been to drink tea 
with me?&quot;  Poar thing, a frendly face was a event  in her life&#8212;a 
tea-party quite a hera! </P>
<P> &quot;Why, perhaps, Lenoir my maid,&quot; says my lady, looking grave.  &quot;I 
 wish, Miss Kicksey, you would not demean yourself by mixing with my 
 domestics.  Recollect, madam, that you are sister to Lady Griffin.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No, my lady, it was not Lenoir; it was a gentleman, and a handsome 
 gentleman, too.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, it was Monsieur de l'Orge, then,&quot; says Miss; &quot;he promised to 
 bring me some guitar-strings.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No, nor yet M. de l'Orge.  He came, but was not so polite as to 
 ask for me.  What do you think of your own beau, the Honorable Mr. 
 Algernon Deuceace;&quot; and, so saying, poar Kicksey clapped her hands 
 together, and looked as joyfle as if she'd come in to a fortin. </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Deuceace here; and why, pray?&quot; says my lady, who recklected 
 all that his exlent pa had been saying to her. </P>
<P> &quot;Why, in the first place, he had left his pocket-book, and in the 
 second, he wanted, he said, a dish of my nice tea; which he took,  and 
stayed with me an hour, or moar.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And pray, Miss Kicksey,&quot; said Miss Matilda, quite contempshusly, 
 &quot;what may have been the subject of your conversation with Mr. 
 Algernon?  Did you talk politics, or music, or fine arts, or 
 metaphysics?&quot;  Miss M. being what was called a blue (as most hump- 
 backed women in sosiaty are), always made a pint to speak on these 
 grand subjects. </P>
<P> &quot;No, indeed; he talked of no such awful matters.  If he had, you 
 know, Matilda, I should never have understood him.  First we talked 
 about the weather, next about muffins and crumpets.  Crumpets, he 
 said, he liked best; and then we talked&quot; (here Miss Kicksey's voice 
 fell) &quot;about poor dear Sir George in heaven! what a good husband he 
 was, and&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What a good fortune he left, eh, Miss Kicksey?&quot; says my lady, with 
 a hard, snearing voice, and a diabollicle grin. </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, dear Leonora, he spoke so respectfully of your blessed 
 husband, and seemed so anxious about you and Matilda, it was quite 
 charming to hear him, dear man!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And pray, Miss Kicksey, what did you tell him?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, I told him that you and Leonora had nine thousand a year, 
and&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What then?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, nothing; that is all I know.  I am sure I wish I had ninety,&quot; 
 says poor Kicksey, her eyes turning to heaven. </P>
<P> &quot;Ninety fiddlesticks!  Did not Mr. Deuceace ask how the money was 
 left, and to which of us?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes; but I could not tell him.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I knew it!&quot; says my lady, slapping down her tea-cup,&#8212;&quot;I knew it!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well!&quot; says Miss Matilda, &quot;and why not, Lady Griffin?  There is no 
 reason you should break your tea-cup, because Algernon asks a 
 harmless question.  HE is not mercenary; he is all candor,  innocence, 
generosity!  He is himself blessed with a sufficient  portion of the 
world's goods to be content; and often and often has  he told me he 
hoped the woman of his choice might come to him  without a penny, that 
he might show the purity of his affection.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I've no doubt,&quot; says my lady.  &quot;Perhaps the lady of his choice is 
 Miss Matilda Griffin!&quot; and she flung out of the room, slamming the 
 door, and leaving Miss Matilda to bust into tears, as was her  reglar 
custom, and pour her loves and woas into the buzzom of Miss  Kicksey. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_4">CHAPTER IV. &quot;HITTING THE NALE ON THE 
HEDD.&quot;</A></H3>
<P> The nex morning, down came me and master to Lady Griffinses,&#8212;I 
 amusing myself with the gals in the antyroom, he paying his devours 
 to the ladies in the salong.  Miss was thrumming on her gitter; my 
 lady was before a great box of papers, busy with accounts, bankers' 
 books, lawyers' letters, and what not.  Law bless us! it's a kind  of 
bisniss I should like well enuff; especially when my hannual  account 
was seven or eight thousand on the right side, like my  lady's.  My 
lady in this house kep all these matters to herself.  Miss was a vast 
deal too sentrimentle to mind business. </P>
<P> Miss Matilda's eyes sparkled as master came in; she pinted 
 gracefully to a place on the sofy beside her, which Deuceace took.  My 
lady only looked up for a moment, smiled very kindly, and down  went 
her head among the papers agen, as busy as a B. </P>
<P> &quot;Lady Griffin has had letters from London,&quot; says Miss, &quot;from nasty 
 lawyers and people.  Come here and sit by me, you naughty man you!&quot; </P>
<P> And down sat master.  &quot;Willingly,&quot; says he, &quot;my dear Miss Griffin; 
 why, I declare, it is quits a tete-a-tete.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says Miss (after the prillimnary flumries, in coarse), &quot;we 
 met a friend of yours at the embassy, Mr. Deuceace.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;My father, doubtless; he is a great friend of the ambassador, and 
 surprised me myself by a visit the night before last.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What a dear delightful old man! how he loves you, Mr. Deuceace!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, amazingly!&quot; says master, throwing his i's to heaven. </P>
<P> &quot;He spoke of nothing but you, and such praises of you!&quot; </P>
<P> Master breathed more freely.  &quot;He is very good, my dear father; but 
 blind, as all fathers are, he is so partial and attached to me.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He spoke of you being his favorite child, and regretted that you 
 were not his eldest son.  'I can but leave him the small portion of  a 
younger brother,' he said; 'but never mind, he has talents, a  noble 
name, and an independence of his own.'&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;An independence? yes, oh yes; I am quite independent of my 
 father.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Two thousand pounds a year left you by your godmother; the very 
 same you told us you know.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Neither more nor less,&quot; says master, bobbing his head; a 
 sufficiency, my dear Miss Griffin,&#8212;to a man of my moderate habits  an 
ample provision.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;By-the-by,&quot; cries out Lady Griffin, interrupting the conversation, 
 &quot;you who are talking about money matters there, I wish you would  come 
to the aid of poor ME!  Come, naughty boy, and help me out  with this 
long long sum.&quot; </P>
<P> DIDN'T HE GO&#8212;that's all!  My i, how his i's shone, as he skipt 
 across the room, and seated himself by my lady! </P>
<P> &quot;Look!&quot; said she, &quot;my agents write me over that they have received 
 a remittance of 7,200 rupees, at 2s. 9d. a rupee.  Do tell me what 
 the sum is, in pounds and shillings;&quot; which master did with great 
 gravity. </P>
<P> &quot;Nine hundred and ninety pounds.  Good; I daresay you are right. 
 I'm sure I can't go through the fatigue to see.  And now comes 
 another question.  Whose money is this, mine or Matilda's?  You see 
 it is the interest of a sum in India, which we have not had  occasion 
to touch; and, according to the terms of poor Sir George's  will, I 
really don't know how to dispose of the money except to  spend it. 
 Matilda, what shall we do with it?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;La, ma'am, I wish you would arrange the business yourself.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, then, Algernon, YOU tell me;&quot; and she laid her hand on his 
 and looked him most pathetickly in the face. </P>
<P> &quot;Why,&quot; says he, &quot;I don't know how Sir George left his money; you 
 must let me see his will, first.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, willingly.&quot; </P>
<P> Master's chair seemed suddenly to have got springs in the cushns; 
 he was obliged to HOLD HIMSELF DOWN. </P>
<P> &quot;Look here, I have only a copy, taken by my hand from Sir George's 
 own manuscript.  Soldiers, you know, do not employ lawyers much,  and 
this was written on the night before going into action.&quot;  And  she 
read, &quot;'I, George Griffin,' know how these things  begin&#8212;'being now of 
sane mind'&#8212;um, um, um,&#8212;'leave to my friends,  Thomas Abraham Hicks, a 
colonel in the H. E. I. Company's Service,  and to John Monro 
Mackirkincroft (of the house of Huffle,  Mackirkincroft, and Dobbs, at 
Calcutta), the whole of my property,  to be realized as speedily as 
they may (consistently with the  interests of the property), in trust 
for my wife, Leonora Emilia  Griffin (born L. E. Kicksey), and my only 
legitimate child, Matilda  Griffin.  The interest resulting from such 
property to be paid to  them, share and share alike; the principal to 
remain untouched, in  the names of the said T. A. Hicks and J. M. 
Mackirkincroft, until  the death of my wife, Leonora Emilia Griffin, 
when it shall be paid  to my daughter, Matilda Griffin, her heirs, 
executors, or assigns.'&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;There,&quot; said my lady, &quot;we won't read any more; all the rest is 
 stuff.  But now you know the whole business, tell us what is to be 
 done with the money?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, the money, unquestionably, should be divided between you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Tant mieux, say I; I really thought it had been all Matilda's.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> There was a paws for a minit or two after the will had been read. 
 Master left the desk at which he had been seated with her ladyship, 
 paced up and down the room for a while, and then came round to the 
 place where Miss Matilda was seated.  At last he said, in a low, 
 trembling voice,&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;I am almost sorry, my dear Lady Griffin, that you have read that 
 will to me; for an attachment such as mine must seem, I fear, 
 mercenary, when the object of it is so greatly favored by worldly 
 fortune.  Miss Griffin&#8212;Matilda!  I know I may say the word; your 
 dear eyes grant me the permission.  I need not tell you, or you,  dear 
mother-in-law, how long, how fondly, I have adored you.  My  tender, my 
beautiful Matilda, I will not affect to say I have not  read your heart 
ere this, and that I have not known the preference  with which you have 
honored me.  SPEAK IT, dear girl! from your own  sweet lips: in the 
presence of an affectionate parent, utter the  sentence which is to 
seal my happiness for life.  Matilda, dearest  Matilda! say, oh say, 
that you love me!&quot; </P>
<P> Miss M. shivered, turned pail, rowled her eyes about, and fell on 
 master's neck, whispering hodibly, &quot;I DO!&quot; </P>
<P> My lady looked at the pair for a moment with her teeth grinding, 
 her i's glaring, her busm throbbing, and her face chock white; for 
 all the world like Madam Pasty, in the oppra of &quot;Mydear&quot; (when  she's 
goin to mudder her childring, you recklect); and out she  flounced from 
the room, without a word, knocking down poar me, who  happened to be 
very near the dor, and leaving my master along with  his crook-back 
mistress. </P>
<P> I've repotted the speech he made to her pretty well.  The fact is, 
 I got it in a ruff copy; only on the copy it's wrote, &quot;Lady  Griffin, 
Leonora!&quot; instead of &quot;Miss Griffin, Matilda,&quot; as in the  abuff, and so 
on. </P>
<P> Master had hit the right nail on the head this time, he thought: 
 but his adventors an't over yet. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_5">CHAPTER V. THE GRIFFIN'S CLAWS.</A></H3>
<P> Well, master had hit the right nail on the head this time: thanx to 
 luck&#8212;the crooked one, to be sure, but then it had the GOOLD NOBB, 
 which was the part Deuceace most valued, as well he should; being a 
 connyshure as to the relletiff valyou of pretious metals, and much 
 preferring virging goold like this to poor old battered iron like  my 
Lady Griffin. </P>
<P> And so, in spite of his father (at which old noblemin Mr. Deuceace 
 now snapt his fingers), in spite of his detts (which, to do him 
 Justas, had never stood much in his way), and in spite of his 
 povatty, idleness, extravagans, swindling, and debotcheries of all 
 kinds (which an't GENERALLY very favorable to a young man who has  to 
make his way in the world); in spite of all, there he was, I  say, at 
the topp of the trea, the fewcher master of a perfect  fortun, the 
defianced husband of a fool of a wife.  What can  mortial man want 
more?  Vishns of ambishn now occupied his soal.  Shooting boxes, oppra 
boxes, money boxes always full; hunters at  Melton; a seat in the house 
of Commins: heaven knows what! and not  a poar footman, who only 
describes what he's seen, and can't, in  cors, pennytrate into the 
idears and the busms of men. </P>
<P> You may be shore that the three-cornered noats came pretty thick 
 now from the Griffinses.  Miss was always a-writing them befoar;  and 
now, nite, noon, and mornink, breakfast, dinner, and sopper, in  they 
came, till my pantry (for master never read 'em, and I carried  'em 
out) was puffickly intolrabble from the odor of musk, ambygrease, 
 bargymot, and other sense with which they were impregniated.  Here's 
 the contense of three on 'em, which I've kep in my dex these twenty 
 years as skeewriosities.  Faw! I can smel 'em at this very minit, as 
 I am copying them down. </P>
<P> BILLY DOO.  No. I. </P>
<P> &quot;Monday morning, 2 o'clock. </P>
<P> &quot;'Tis the witching hour of night.  Luna illumines my chamber, and 
 falls upon my sleepless pillow.  By her light I am inditing these 
 words to thee, my Algernon.  My brave and beautiful, my soul's  lord! 
when shall the time come when the tedious night shall not  separate us, 
nor the blessed day?  Twelve! one! two!  I have heard  the bells chime, 
and the quarters, and never cease to think of my  husband.  My adored 
Percy, pardon the girlish confession,&#8212;I have  kissed the letter at 
this place.  Will thy lips press it too, and  remain for a moment on 
the spot which has been equally saluted by  your </P>
<P> &quot;MATILDA?&quot; </P>
<P> This was the FUST letter, and was brot to our house by one of the 
 poar footmin, Fitzclarence, at sicks o'clock in the morning.  I  thot 
it was for life and death, and woak master at that extraornary  hour, 
and gave it to him.  I shall never forgit him, when he red  it; he 
cramped it up, and he cust and swoar, applying to the lady  who roat, 
the genlmn that brought it, and me who introjuiced it to  his notice 
such a collection of epitafs as I seldum hered, excep at  Billinxgit. 
 The fact is thiss; for a fust letter, miss's noat was  RATHER too 
strong and sentymentle.  But that was her way; she was  always reading 
melancholy stoary books&#8212;&quot;Thaduse of Wawsaw,&quot; the  &quot;Sorrows of 
MacWhirter,&quot; and such like. </P>
<P> After about 6 of them, master never yoused to read them, but handid 
 them over to me, to see if there was anythink in them which must be 
 answered, in order to kip up appearuntses.  The next letter is </P>
<P> No. II. </P>
<P> &quot;BELOVED! to what strange madnesses will passion lead one!  Lady 
 Griffin, since your avowal yesterday, has not spoken a word to your 
 poor Matilda; has declared that she will admit no one (heigho! not 
 even you, my Algernon); and has locked herself in her own dressing- 
 room.  I do believe that she is JEALOUS, and fancies that you were  in 
love with HER!  Ha, ha!  I could have told her ANOTHER TALE&#8212;  n'est-ce 
pas?  Adieu, adieu, adieu!  A thousand thousand million  kisses! </P>
<P> &quot;M. G. </P>
<P> &quot;Monday afternoon, 2 o'clock.&quot; </P>
<P> There was another letter kem before bedtime; for though me and 
 master called at the Griffinses, we wairnt aloud to enter at no 
 price.  Mortimer and Fitzclarence grin'd at me, as much as to say  we 
were going to be relations; but I don't spose master was very  sorry 
when he was obleached to come back without seeing the fare  objict of 
his affeckshns. </P>
<P> Well, on Chewsdy there was the same game; ditto on Wensday; only, 
 when we called there, who should we see but our father, Lord Crabs, 
 who was waiving his hand to Miss Kicksey, and saying HE SHOULD BE 
 BACK TO DINNER AT 7, just as me and master came up the stares.  There 
was no admittns for us though.  &quot;Bah! bah! never mind,&quot; says  my lord, 
taking his son affeckshnately by the hand.  &quot;What, two  strings to your 
bow; ay, Algernon?  The dowager a little jealous,  miss a little 
lovesick.  But my lady's fit of anger will vanish,  and I promise you, 
my boy, that you shall see your fair one to-  morrow.&quot; </P>
<P> And so saying, my lord walked master down stares, looking at him as 
 tender and affeckshnat, and speaking to him as sweet as posbill. 
 Master did not know what to think of it.  He never new what game  his 
old father was at; only he somehow felt that he had got his  head in a 
net, in spite of his suxess on Sunday.  I knew it&#8212;I knew  it quite 
well, as soon as I saw the old genlmn igsammin him by a  kind of smile 
which came over his old face, and was somethink  betwigst the angellic 
and the direbollicle. </P>
<P> But master's dowts were cleared up nex day and every thing was 
 bright again.  At brexfast, in comes a note with inclosier, boath  of 
witch I here copy:&#8212; </P>
<P> No. IX. </P>
<P> &quot;Thursday morning. </P>
<P> &quot;Victoria, Victoria! Mamma has yielded at last; not her consent to 
 our union, but her consent to receive you as before; and has  promised 
to forget the past.  Silly woman, how could she ever think  of you as 
anything but the lover of your Matilda?  I am in a whirl  of delicious 
joy and passionate excitement.  I have been awake all  this long night, 
thinking of thee, my Algernon, and longing for the  blissful hour of 
meeting. </P>
<P> &quot;Come!  M. G.&quot; </P>
<P> This is the inclosier from my lady:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;I will not tell you that your behavior on Sunday did not deeply 
 shock me.  I had been foolish enough to think of other plans, and  to 
fancy your heart (if you had any) was fixed elsewhere than on  one at 
whose foibles you have often laughed with me, and whose  person at 
least cannot have charmed you. </P>
<P> &quot;My step-daughter will not, I presume, marry without at least going 
 through the ceremony of asking my consent; I cannot, as yet, give  it. 
 Have I not reason to doubt whether she will be happy in  trusting 
herself to you? </P>
<P> &quot;But she is of age, and has the right to receive in her own house 
 all those who may be agreeable to her,&#8212;certainly you, who are  likely 
to be one day so nearly connected with her.  If I have  honest reason 
to believe that your love for Miss Griffin is  sincere; if I find in a 
few months that you yourself are still  desirous to marry her, I can, 
of course, place no further obstacles  in your way. </P>
<P> &quot;You are welcome, then, to return to our hotel.  I cannot promise 
 to receive you as I did of old; you would despise me if I did.  I  can 
promise, however, to think no more of all that has passed  between us, 
and yield up my own happiness for that of the daughter  of my dear 
husband. </P>
<P> &quot;L. E. G.&quot; </P>
<P> Well, now, an't this a manly, straitforard letter enough, and 
 natral from a woman whom we had, to confess the truth, treated most 
 scuvvily?  Master thought so, and went and made a tender, respeckful 
 speach to Lady Griffin (a little flumry costs nothink).  Grave and 
 sorroflle he kist her hand, and, speakin in a very low adgitayted 
 voice, calld Hevn to witness how he deplord that his conduct should 
 ever have given rise to such an unfornt ideer; but if he might offer 
 her esteem, respect, the warmest and tenderest admiration, he  trusted 
she would accept the same, and a deal moar flumry of the  kind, with 
dark, sollum glansis of the eyes, and plenty of white 
 pockit-hankercher. </P>
<P> He thought he'd make all safe.  Poar fool! he was in a net&#8212;sich a 
 net as I never yet see set to ketch a roag in. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_6">CHAPTER VI. THE JEWEL.</A></H3>
<P> The Shevalier de l'Orge, the young Frenchmin whom I wrote of in my 
 last, who had been rather shy of his visits while master was coming 
 it so very strong, now came back to his old place by the side of  Lady 
Griffin: there was no love now, though, betwigst him and  master, 
although the shevallier had got his lady back agin;  Deuceace being 
compleatly devoted to his crookid Veanus. </P>
<P> The shevalier was a little, pale, moddist, insinifishnt creature; 
 and I shoodn't have thought, from his appearants, would have the 
 heart to do harm to a fli, much less to stand befor such a 
 tremendious tiger and fire-eater as my master.  But I see putty  well, 
after a week, from his manner of going on&#8212;of speakin at  master, and 
lookin at him, and olding his lips tight when Deuceace  came into the 
room, and glaring at him with his i's, that he hated  the Honrabble 
Algernon Percy. </P>
<P> Shall I tell you why?  Because my Lady Griffin hated him: hated him 
 wuss than pison, or the devvle, or even wuss than her daughter-in- 
 law.  Praps you phansy that the letter you have juss red was  honest; 
praps you amadgin that the sean of the reading of the will  came on by 
mere chans, and in the reglar cors of suckmstansies: it  was all a 
GAME, I tell you&#8212;a reglar trap; and that extrodnar  clever young man, 
my master, as neatly put his foot into it, as  ever a pocher did in 
fesnt preserve. </P>
<P> The shevalier had his q from Lady Griffin.  When Deuceace went off 
 the feald, back came De l'Orge to her feet, not a witt less tender 
 than befor.  Por fellow, por fellow! he really loved this woman.  He 
might as well have foln in love with a bore-constructor!  He was  so 
blinded and beat by the power wich she had got over him, that if  she 
told him black was white he'd beleave it, or if she ordered him  to 
commit murder, he'd do it: she wanted something very like it, I  can 
tell you. </P>
<P> I've already said how, in the fust part of their acquaintance, 
 master used to laff at De l'Orge's bad Inglish, and funny ways.  The 
little creature had a thowsnd of these; and being small, and a 
 Frenchman, master, in cors, looked on him with that good-humored  kind 
of contemp which a good Brittn ot always to show.  He rayther  treated 
him like an intelligent munky than a man, and ordered him  about as if 
he'd bean my lady's footman. </P>
<P> All this munseer took in very good part, until after the quarl 
 betwigst master and Lady Griffin; when that lady took care to turn 
 the tables.  Whenever master and miss were not present (as I've  heard 
the servants say), she used to laff at shevalliay for his  obeajance 
and sivillatty to master.  For her part, she wondered how  a man of his 
birth could act a servnt: how any man could submit to  such 
contemsheous behavior from another; and then she told him how  Deuceace 
was always snearing at him behind his back; how, in fact,  he ought to 
hate him corjaly, and how it was suttaly time to show  his sperrit. </P>
<P> Well, the poar little man beleaved all this from his hart, and was 
 angry or pleased, gentle or quarlsum, igsactly as my lady liked. 
 There got to be frequint rows betwigst him and master; sharp words 
 flung at each other across the dinner-table; dispewts about handing 
 ladies their smeling-botls, or seeing them to their carridge; or 
 going in and out of a roam fust, or any such nonsince. </P>
<P> &quot;For hevn's sake,&quot; I heerd my lady, in the midl of one of these 
 tiffs, say, pail, and the tears trembling in her i's, &quot;do, do be 
 calm, Mr. Deuceace.  Monsieur de l'Orge, I beseech you to forgive 
 him.  You are, both of you, so esteemed, lov'd, by members of this 
 family, that for its peace as well as your own, you should forbear  to 
quarrel.&quot; </P>
<P> It was on the way to the Sally Mangy that this brangling had begun, 
 and it ended jest as they were seating themselves.  I shall never 
 forgit poar little De l'Orge's eyes, when my lady said &quot;both of  you.&quot; 
 He stair'd at my lady for a momint, turned pail, red, look'd  wild, 
and then, going round to master, shook his hand as if he  would have 
wrung it off.  Mr. Deuceace only bow'd and grin'd, and  turned away 
quite stately; Miss heaved a loud O from her busm, and  looked up in 
his face with an igspreshn jest as if she could have  eat him up with 
love; and the little shevalliay sate down to his  soop-plate, and wus 
so happy, that I'm blest if he wasn't crying!  He thought the widdow 
had made her declyration, and would have him;  and so thought Deuceace, 
who look'd at her for some time mighty  bitter and contempshus, and 
then fell a-talking with Miss. </P>
<P> Now, though master didn't choose to marry Lady Griffin, as he might 
 have done, he yet thought fit to be very angry at the notion of her 
 marrying anybody else; and so, consquintly, was in a fewry at this 
 confision which she had made regarding her parshaleaty for the  French 
shevaleer. </P>
<P> And this I've perseaved in the cors of my expearants through life, 
 that when you vex him, a roag's no longer a roag: you find him out  at 
onst when he's in a passion, for he shows, as it ware, his  cloven foot 
the very instnt you tread on it.  At least, this is  what YOUNG roags 
do; it requires very cool blood and long practis  to get over this 
pint, and not to show your pashn when you feel it  and snarl when you 
are angry.  Old Crabs wouldn't do it; being like  another noblemin, of 
whom I heard the Duke of Wellington say, while  waiting behind his 
graci's chair, that if you were kicking him from  behind, no one 
standing before him would know it, from the bewtifle  smiling igspreshn 
of his face.  Young master hadn't got so far in  the thief's grammer, 
and, when he was angry, show'd it.  And it's  also to be remarked (a 
very profownd observatin for a footmin, but  we have i's though we DO 
wear plush britchis), it's to be remarked,  I say, that one of these 
chaps is much sooner maid angry than  another, because honest men yield 
to other people, roags never do;  honest men love other people, roags 
only themselves; and the  slightest thing which comes in the way of 
thir beloved objects sets  them fewrious.  Master hadn't led a life of 
gambling, swindling,  and every kind of debotch to be good-tempered at 
the end of it, I  prommis you. </P>
<P> He was in a pashun, and when he WAS in a pashn, a more insalent, 
 insuffrable, overbearing broot didn't live. </P>
<P> This was the very pint to which my lady wished to bring him; for I 
 must tell you, that though she had been trying all her might to set 
 master and the shevalliay by the years, she had suxeaded only so  far 
as to make them hate each profowndly: but somehow or other, the  2 cox 
wouldn't FIGHT. </P>
<P> I doan't think Deuceace ever suspected any game on the part of her 
 ladyship, for she carried it on so admirally, that the quarls which 
 daily took place betwigst him and the Frenchman never seemed to  come 
from her; on the contry, she acted as the reglar pease-maker  between 
them, as I've just shown in the tiff which took place at  the door of 
the Sally Mangy.  Besides, the 2 young men, though  reddy enough to 
snarl, were natrally unwilling to come to bloes.  I'll tell you why: 
being friends, and idle, they spent their  mornins as young fashnabbles 
genrally do, at billiads, fensing,  riding, pistle-shooting, or some 
such improoving study.  In  billiads, master beat the Frenchman hollow 
(and had won a pretious  sight of money from him: but that's neither 
here nor there, or, as  the French say, ontry noo); at pistle-shooting, 
master could knock  down eight immidges out of ten, and De l'Orge 
seven; and in  fensing, the Frenchman could pink the Honorable Algernon 
down evry  one of his weskit buttns.  They'd each of them been out more 
than  onst, for every Frenchman will fight, and master had been 
obleag'd  to do so in the cors of his bisniss; and knowing each other's 
 curridg, as well as the fact that either could put a hundrid bolls 
 running into a hat at 30 yards, they wairnt very willing to try  such 
exparrymence upon their own hats with their own heads in them.  So you 
see they kep quiet, and only grould at each other. </P>
<P> But to-day Deuceace was in one of his thundering black humers; and 
 when in this way he wouldn't stop for man or devvle.  I said that  he 
walked away from the shevalliay, who had given him his hand in  his 
sudden bust of joyfle good-humor; and who, I do bleave, would  have 
hugd a she-bear, so very happy was he.  Master walked away  from him 
pale and hotty, and, taking his seat at table, no moor  mindid the 
brandishments of Miss Griffin, but only replied to them  with a pshaw, 
or a dam at one of us servnts, or abuse of the soop,  or the wine; 
cussing and swearing like a trooper, and not like a  well-bred son of a 
noble British peer. </P>
<P> &quot;Will your ladyship,&quot; says he, slivering off the wing of a pully 
 ally bashymall, &quot;allow me to help you?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I thank you! no; but I will trouble Monsieur de l'Orge.&quot;  And 
 towards that gnlmn she turned, with a most tender and fasnating 
 smile. </P>
<P> &quot;Your ladyship has taken a very sudden admiration for Mr. de 
 l'Orge's carving.  You used to like mine once.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You are very skilful; but to-day, if you will allow me, I will 
 partake of something a little simpler.&quot; </P>
<P> The Frenchman helped; and, being so happy, in cors, spilt the 
 gravy.  A great blob of brown sos spurted on to master's chick, and 
 myandrewed down his shert-collar and virging-white weskit. </P>
<P> &quot;Confound you!&quot; says he, &quot;M. de l'Orge, you have done this on 
 purpose.&quot;  And down went his knife and fork, over went his tumbler  of 
wine, a deal of it into poar Miss Griffinses lap, who looked  fritened 
and ready to cry. </P>
<P> My lady bust into a fit of laffin, peel upon peel, as if it was the 
 best joak in the world.  De l'Orge giggled and grin'd too.  &quot;Pardong,&quot; 
says he; &quot;meal pardong, mong share munseer.&quot;*  And he  looked as if he 
would have done it again for a penny. </P>
<P> * In the long dialogues, we have generally ventured to change the 
 peculiar spelling of our friend Mr. Yellowplush. </P>
<P> The little Frenchman was quite in extasis; he found himself all of 
 a suddn at the very top of the trea; and the laff for onst turned 
 against his rivle: he actialy had the ordassaty to propose to my  lady 
in English to take a glass of wine. </P>
<P> &quot;Veal you,&quot; says he, in his jargin, &quot;take a glas of Madere viz me, 
 mi ladi?&quot;  And he looked round, as if he'd igsackly hit the English 
 manner and pronunciation. </P>
<P> &quot;With the greatest pleasure,&quot; says Lady G., most graciously nodding 
 at him, and gazing at him as she drank up the wine.  She'd refused 
 master before, and THIS didn't increase his good-humer. </P>
<P> Well, they went on, master snarling, snapping, and swearing, making 
 himself, I must confess, as much of a blaggard as any I ever see;  and 
my lady employing her time betwigst him and the shevalliay,  doing 
every think to irritate master, and flatter the Frenchmn.  Desert came: 
and by this time, Miss was stock-still with fright,  the chevaleer half 
tipsy with pleasure and gratafied vannaty, my  lady puffickly raygent 
with smiles and master bloo with rage. </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Deuceace,&quot; says my lady, in a most winning voice, after a 
 little chaffing (in which she only worked him up moar and moar),  &quot;may 
I trouble you for a few of those grapes? they look delicious.&quot; </P>
<P> For answer, master seas'd hold of the grayp dish, and sent it 
 sliding down the table to De l'Orge; upsetting, in his way, fruit- 
 plates, glasses, dickanters, and heaven knows what. </P>
<P> &quot;Monsieur de l'Orge,&quot; says he, shouting out at the top of his 
 voice, &quot;have the goodness to help Lady Griffin.  She wanted MY  grapes 
long ago, and has found out they are sour!&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> There was a dead paws of a moment or so. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> &quot;Ah!&quot; says my lady, &quot;vous osez m'insulter, devant mes gens, dans ma 
 propre maison&#8212;c'est par trop fort, monsieur.&quot;  And up she got, and 
 flung out of the room.  Miss followed her, screeching out, &quot;Mamma&#8212; 
 for God's sake&#8212;Lady Griffin!&quot; and here the door slammed on the  pair. </P>
<P> Her ladyship did very well to speak French.  DE L'ORGE WOULD NOT 
 HAVE UNDERSTOOD HER ELSE; as it was he heard quite enough; and as  the 
door clikt too, in the presents of me, and Messeers Mortimer  and 
Fitzclarence, the family footmen, he walks round to my master,  and 
hits him a slap on the face, and says, &quot;prends ca, menteur et  lache!&quot; 
which means, &quot;Take that, you liar and coward!&quot;&#8212;rayther  strong 
igspreshns for one genlmn to use to another. </P>
<P> Master staggered back and looked bewildered; and then he gave a 
 kind of a scream, and then he made a run at the Frenchman, and then 
 me and Mortimer flung ourselves upon him, whilst Fitzclarence 
 embraced the shevalliay. </P>
<P> &quot;A demain!&quot; says he, clinching his little fist, and walking away, 
 not very sorry to git off. </P>
<P> When he was fairly down stares, we let go of master: who swallowed 
 a goblit of water, and then pawsing a little and pullout his pus,  he 
presented to Messeers Mortimer and Fitzclarence a luydor each.  &quot;I will 
give you five more to-morrow,&quot; says he, &quot;if you will  promise to keep 
this secrit.&quot; </P>
<P> And then he walked in to the ladies.  &quot;If you knew,&quot; says he, going 
 up to Lady Griffin, and speaking very slow (in cors we were all at 
 the keyhole), &quot;the pain I have endured in the last minute, in 
 consequence of the rudeness and insolence of which I have been  guilty 
to your ladyship, you would think my own remorse was  punishment 
sufficient, and would grant me pardon.&quot; </P>
<P> My lady bowed, and said she didn't wish for explanations.  Mr. 
 Deuceace was her daughter's guest, and not hers; but she certainly 
 would never demean herself by sitting again at table with him.  And 
 so saying out she boltid again. </P>
<P> &quot;Oh! Algernon! Algernon!&quot; says Miss, in teers, &quot;what is this 
 dreadful mystery&#8212;these fearful shocking quarrels?  Tell me, has 
 anything happened?  Where, where is the chevalier?&quot; </P>
<P> Master smiled and said, &quot;Be under no alarm, my sweetest Matilda. 
 De l'Orge did not understand a word of the dispute; he was too much 
 in love for that.  He is but gone away for half an hour, I believe; 
 and will return to coffee.&quot; </P>
<P> I knew what master's game was, for if miss had got a hinkling of 
 the quarrel betwigst him and the Frenchman, we should have had her 
 screeming at the &quot;Hotel Mirabeu,&quot; and the juice and all to pay.  He 
 only stopt for a few minnits and cumfitted her, and then drove off  to 
his friend, Captain Bullseye, of the Rifles; with whom, I spose,  he 
talked over this unplesnt bisniss.  We fownd, at our hotel, a  note 
from De l'Orge, saying where his secknd was to be seen. </P>
<P> Two mornings after there was a parrowgraf in Gallynanny's 
 Messinger, which I hear beg leaf to transcribe:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;FEARFUL DUEL.&#8212;Yesterday morning, at six o'clock, a meeting took 
 place, in the Bois de Boulogne, between the Hon. A. P. D&#8212;ce-ce, a 
 younger son of the Earl of Cr-bs, and the Chevalier de l'O&#8212;-.  The 
 chevalier was attended by Major de M&#8212;-, of the Royal Guard, and  the 
Hon. Mr. D&#8212;- by Captain B-lls-ye, of the British Rifle Corps.  As far 
as we have been able to learn the particulars of this  deplorable 
affair, the dispute originated in the house of a lovely  lady (one of 
the most brilliant ornaments of our embassy), and the  duel took place 
on the morning ensuing. </P>
<P> &quot;The chevalier (the challenged party, and the most accomplished 
 amateur swordsman in Paris) waived his right of choosing the  weapons, 
and the combat took place with pistols. </P>
<P> &quot;The combatants were placed at forty paces, with directions to 
 advance to a barrier which separated them only eight paces.  Each  was 
furnished with two pistols.  Monsieur de l'O&#8212;- fired almost 
 immediately, and the ball took effect in the left wrist of his 
 antagonist, who dropped the pistol which he held in that hand.  He 
 fired, however, directly with his right, and the chevalier fell to 
 the ground, we fear mortally wounded.  A ball has entered above his 
 hip-joint, and there is very little hope that he can recover. </P>
<P> &quot;We have heard that the cause of this desperate duel was a blow 
 which the chevalier ventured to give to the Hon. Mr. D.  If so,  there 
is some reason for the unusual and determined manner in which  the duel 
was fought. </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Deu&#8212;a-e returned to his hotel; whither his excellent father, 
 the Right Hon. Earl of Cr-bs, immediately hastened on hearing of  the 
sad news, and is now bestowing on his son the most affectionate 
 parental attention.  The news only reached his lordship yesterday  at 
noon, while at breakfast with his Excellency Lord Bobtail, our 
 ambassador.  The noble earl fainted on receiving the intelligence; 
 but in spite of the shock to his own nerves and health, persisted  in 
passing last night by the couch of his son.&quot; </P>
<P> And so he did.  &quot;This is a sad business, Charles,&quot; says my lord to 
 me, after seeing his son, and settling himself down in our salong. 
 &quot;Have you any segars in the house?  And hark ye, send me up a  bottle 
of wine and some luncheon.  I can certainly not leave the  neighborhood 
of my dear boy.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_7">CHAPTER VII. THE CONSQUINSIES.</A></H3>
<P> The shevalliay did not die, for the ball came out of its own 
 accord, in the midst of a violent fever and inflamayshn which was 
 brot on by the wound.  He was kept in bed for 6 weeks though, and  did 
not recover for a long time after. </P>
<P> As for master, his lot, I'm sorry to say, was wuss than that of his 
 advisary.  Inflammation came on too; and, to make an ugly story 
 short, they were obliged to take off his hand at the rist. </P>
<P> He bore it, in cors, like a Trojin, and in a month he too was well, 
 and his wound heel'd; but I never see a man look so like a devvle  as 
he used sometimes, when he looked down at the stump! </P>
<P> To be sure, in Miss Griffinses eyes, this only indeerd him the mor. 
 She sent twenty noats a day to ask for him, calling him her  beloved, 
her unfortunat, her hero, her wictim, and I dono what.  I've kep some 
of the noats, as I tell you, and curiously  sentimentle they are, 
beating the sorrows of MacWhirter all to  nothing. </P>
<P> Old Crabs used to come offen, and consumed a power of wine and 
 seagars at our house.  I bleave he was at Paris because there was  an 
exycution in his own house in England; and his son was a sure  find (as 
they say) during his illness, and couldn't deny himself to  the old 
genlmn.  His eveninx my lord spent reglar at Lady Griffin's;  where, as 
master was ill, I didn't go any more now, and where the  shevalier 
wasn't there to disturb him. </P>
<P> &quot;You see how that woman hates you, Deuceace,&quot; says my lord, one 
 day, in a fit of cander, after they had been talking about Lady 
 Griffin: &quot;SHE HAS NOT DONE WITH YOU YET, I tell you fairly.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Curse her,&quot; says master, in a fury, lifting up his maim'd arm&#8212; 
 &quot;curse her! but I will be even with her one day.  I am sure of 
 Matilda: I took care to put that beyond the reach of a failure.  The 
girl must marry me, for her own sake.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;FOR HER OWN SAKE!  O ho!  Good, good!&quot;  My lord lifted his i's, 
 and said gravely, &quot;I understand, my dear boy: it is an excellent 
 plan.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says master, grinning fearcely and knowingly at his exlent 
 old father, &quot;as the girl is safe, what harm can I fear from the  fiend 
of a step-mother?&quot; </P>
<P> My lord only gev a long whizzle, and, soon after, taking up his 
 hat, walked off.  I saw him sawnter down the Plas Vandome, and go  in 
quite calmly to the old door of Lady Griffinses hotel.  Bless  his old 
face! such a puffickly good-natured, kind-hearted, merry,  selfish old 
scoundrel, I never shall see again. </P>
<P> His lordship was quite right in saying to master that &quot;Lady Griffin 
 hadn't done with him.&quot;  No moar she had.  But she never would have 
 thought of the nex game she was going to play, IF SOMEBODY HADN'T  PUT 
HER UP TO IT.  Who did?  If you red the above passidge, and saw  how a 
venrabble old genlmn took his hat, and sauntered down the  Plas Vandome 
(looking hard and kind at all the nussary-maids&#8212;buns  they call them 
in France&#8212;in the way), I leave you to guess who was  the author of the 
nex scheam: a woman, suttnly, never would have  pitcht on it. </P>
<P> In the fuss payper which I wrote concerning Mr. Deuceace's 
adventers,  and his kind behayvior to Messrs. Dawkins and Blewitt, I 
had the  honor of laying before the public a skidewl of my master's 
detts, in  witch was the following itim: </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
     &quot;Bills of xchange and I.O.U.'s, 4963L. 0s. 0d.&quot;
</PRE>
<P> The I.O.U.se were trifling, say a thowsnd pound.  The bills 
 amountid to four thowsnd moar. </P>
<P> Now, the lor is in France, that if a genlmn gives these in England, 
 and a French genlmn gits them in any way, he can pursew the 
 Englishman who has drawn them, even though he should be in France. 
 Master did not know this fact&#8212;laboring under a very common mistak, 
 that, when onst out of England, he might wissle at all the debts he 
 left behind him. </P>
<P> My Lady Griffin sent over to her slissators in London, who made 
 arrangemints with the persons who possest the fine collection of 
 ortografs on stampt paper which master had left behind him; and  they 
were glad enuff to take any oppertunity of getting back their  money. </P>
<P> One fine morning, as I was looking about in the court-yard of our 
 hotel, talking to the servant-gals, as was my reglar custom, in  order 
to improve myself in the French languidge, one of them comes  up to me 
and says, &quot;Tenez, Monsieur Charles, down below in the  office there is 
a bailiff, with a couple of gendarmes, who is  asking for your 
master&#8212;a-t-il des dettes par hasard?&quot; </P>
<P> I was struck all of a heap&#8212;the truth flasht on my mind's hi. 
 &quot;Toinette,&quot; says I, for that was the gal's name&#8212;&quot;Toinette,&quot; says  I, 
giving her a kiss, &quot;keep them for two minits, as you valyou my 
 affeckshn;&quot; and then I gave her another kiss, and ran up stares to 
 our chambers.  Master had now pretty well recovered of his wound,  and 
was aloud to drive abowt: it was lucky for him that he had the 
 strength to move.  &quot;Sir, sir,&quot; says I, &quot;the bailiffs are after you, 
 and you must run for your life.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Bailiff?&quot; says he: &quot;nonsense!  I don't, thank heaven, owe a 
 shilling to any man.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Stuff, sir,&quot; says I, forgetting my respeck; &quot;don't you owe money 
 in England?  I tell you the bailiffs are here, and will be on you  in 
a moment.&quot; </P>
<P> As I spoke, cling cling, ling ling, goes the bell of the 
antyshamber,  and there they were sure enough! </P>
<P> What was to be done?  Quick as litening, I throws off my livry 
 coat, claps my goold lace hat on master's head, and makes him put  on 
my livry.  Then I wraps myself up in his dressing-gown, and  lolling 
down on the sofa, bids him open the dor. </P>
<P> There they were&#8212;the bailiff&#8212;two jondarms with him&#8212;Toinette, and 
 an old waiter.  When Toinette sees master, she smiles, and says:  &quot;Dis 
donc, Charles! ou est donc ton maitre?  Chez lui, n'est-ce  pas?  C'est 
le jeune a monsieur,&quot; says she, curtsying to the  bailiff. </P>
<P> The old waiter was just a-going to blurt out, &quot;Mais ce n'est pas!&quot; 
 when Toinette stops him, and says, &quot;Laissez donc passer ces 
 messieurs, vieux bete;&quot; and in they walk, the 2 jon d'arms taking 
 their post in the hall. </P>
<P> Master throws open the salong doar very gravely, and touching MY 
 hat says, &quot;Have you any orders about the cab, sir?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, no, Chawls,&quot; says I; &quot;I shan't drive out to-day.&quot; </P>
<P> The old bailiff grinned, for he understood English (having had 
 plenty of English customers), and says in French, as master goes  out, 
&quot;I think, sir, you had better let your servant get a coach,  for I am 
under the painful necessity of arresting you, au nom de la  loi, for 
the sum of ninety-eight thousand seven hundred francs,  owed by you to 
the Sieur Jacques Francois Lebrun, of Paris;&quot; and he  pulls out a 
number of bills, with master's acceptances on them sure  enough. </P>
<P> &quot;Take a chair, sir,&quot; says I; and down he sits; and I began to chaff 
 him, as well as I could, about the weather, my illness, my sad 
 axdent, having lost one of my hands, which was stuck into my busum, 
 and so on. </P>
<P> At last, after a minnit or two, I could contane no longer, and bust 
 out in a horse laff. </P>
<P> The old fellow turned quite pail, and began to suspect somethink. 
 &quot;Hola!&quot; says he; &quot;gendarmes! a moi! a moi!  Je suis floue, vole,&quot; 
 which means, in English, that he was reglar sold. </P>
<P> The jondarmes jumped into the room, and so did Toinette and the 
 waiter.  Grasefly rising from my arm-chare, I took my hand from my 
 dressing-gownd, and, flinging it open, stuck up on the chair one of 
 the neatest legs ever seen. </P>
<P> I then pinted majestickly&#8212;to what do you think?&#8212;to my PLUSH 
 TITES! those sellabrated inigspressables which have rendered me 
 famous in Yourope. </P>
<P> Taking the hint, the jondarmes and the servnts rord out laffing; 
 and so did Charles Yellowplush, Esquire, I can tell you.  Old 
 Grippard the bailiff looked as if he would faint in his chare. </P>
<P> I heard a kab galloping like mad out of the hotel-gate, and knew 
 then that my master was safe. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_8">CHAPTER VIII. THE END OF MR. 
DEUCEACE'S HISTORY.  LIMBO.</A></H3>
<P> My tail is droring rabidly to a close; my suvvice with Mr. Deuceace 
 didn't continyou very long after the last chapter, in which I 
 described my admiral strattyjam, and my singlar self-devocean. 
 There's very few servnts, I can tell you, who'd have thought of  such 
a contrivance, and very few moar would have eggsycuted it when  thought 
of. </P>
<P> But, after all, beyond the trifling advantich to myself in selling 
 master's roab de sham, which you, gentle reader, may remember I  woar, 
and in dixcovering a fipun note in one of the pockets,&#8212;  beyond this, 
I say, there was to poar master very little advantich  in what had been 
done.  It's true he had escaped.  Very good.  But  Frans is not like 
Great Brittin; a man in a livry coat, with 1 arm,  is pretty easily 
known, and caught, too, as I can tell you. </P>
<P> Such was the case with master.  He coodn leave Paris, moarover, if 
 he would.  What was to become, in that case, of his bride&#8212;his 
 unchbacked hairis?  He knew that young lady's temprimong (as the 
 Parishers say) too well to let her long out of his site.  She had 
 nine thousand a yer.  She'd been in love a duzn times befor, and  mite 
be agin.  The Honrabble Algernon Deuceace was a little too  wide awake 
to trust much to the constnsy of so very inflammable a  young creacher. 
 Heavn bless us, it was a marycle she wasn't  earlier married!  I do 
bleave (from suttn seans that past betwigst  us) that she'd have 
married me, if she hadn't been sejuiced by the  supearor rank and 
indianuity of the genlmn in whose survace I was. </P>
<P> Well, to use a commin igspreshn, the beaks were after him.  How was 
 he to manitch?  He coodn get away from his debts, and he wooden  quit 
the fare objict of his affeckshns.  He was ableejd, then, as  the 
French say, to lie perdew,&#8212;going out at night, like a howl out  of a 
hivy-bush, and returning in the daytime to his roast.  For its  a maxum 
in France (and I wood it were followed in Ingland), that  after dark no 
man is lible for his detts; and in any of the royal  gardens&#8212;the 
Twillaries, the Pally Roil, or the Lucksimbug, for  example&#8212;a man may 
wander from sunrise to evening, and hear nothing  of the ojus dunns: 
they an't admitted into these places of public  enjyment and rondyvoo 
any more than dogs; the centuries at the  garden-gates having orders to 
shuit all such. </P>
<P> Master, then, was in this uncomfrable situation&#8212;neither liking to 
 go nor to stay! peeping out at nights to have an interview with his 
 miss; ableagd to shuffle off her repeated questions as to the  reason 
of all this disgeise, and to talk of his two thowsnd a year  jest as if 
he had it and didn't owe a shilling in the world. </P>
<P> Of course, now, he began to grow mighty eager for the marritch. </P>
<P> He roat as many noats as she had done befor; swoar against delay 
 and cerymony; talked of the pleasures of Hyming, the ardship that  the 
ardor of two arts should be allowed to igspire, the folly of  waiting 
for the consent of Lady Griffin.  She was but a step-  mother, and an 
unkind one.  Miss was (he said) a major, might marry  whom she liked; 
and suttnly had paid Lady G. quite as much  attention as she ought, by 
paying her the compliment to ask her at  all. </P>
<P> And so they went on.  The curious thing was, that when master was 
 pressed about his cause for not coming out till night-time, he was 
 misterus; and Miss Griffin, when asked why she wooden marry, 
 igsprest, or rather, DIDN'T igspress, a simlar secrasy.  Wasn't it 
 hard? the cup seemed to be at the lip of both of 'em, and yet 
 somehow, they could not manitch to take a drink. </P>
<P> But one morning, in reply to a most desprat epistol wrote by my 
 master over night, Deuceace, delighted, gits an answer from his 
 soal's beluffd, which ran thus:&#8212; </P>
<P> MISS GRIFFIN TO THE HON. A. P. DEUCEACE. </P>
<P> &quot;DEAREST,&#8212;You say you would share a cottage with me; there is no 
 need, luckily, for that!  You plead the sad sinking of your spirits 
 at our delayed union.  Beloved, do you think MY heart rejoices at  our 
separation?  You bid me disregard the refusal of Lady Griffin,  and 
tell me that I owe her no further duty. </P>
<P> &quot;Adored Algernon!  I can refuse you no more.  I was willing not to 
 lose a single chance of reconciliation with this unnatural step- 
 mother.  Respect for the memory of my sainted father bid me do all  in 
my power to gain her consent to my union with you: nay, shall I  own 
it? prudence dictated the measure; for to whom should she leave  the 
share of money accorded to her by my father's will but to my  father's 
child. </P>
<P> &quot;But there are bounds beyond which no forbearance can go; and, 
 thank heaven, we have no need of looking to Lady Griffin for sordid 
 wealth: we have a competency without her.  Is it not so, dearest 
 Algernon? </P>
<P> &quot;Be it as you wish, then, dearest, bravest, and best.  Your poor 
 Matilda has yielded to you her heart long ago; she has no longer  need 
to keep back her name.  Name the hour, and I will delay no  more; but 
seek for refuge in your arms from the contumely and  insult which meet 
me ever here. </P>
<P> &quot;MATILDA. </P>
<P> &quot;P.S.  Oh, Algernon! if you did but know what a noble part your 
 dear father has acted throughout, in doing his best endeavors to 
 further our plans, and to soften Lady Griffin!  It is not his fault 
 that she is inexorable as she is.  I send you a note sent by her to 
 Lord Crabs; we will laugh at it soon, n'est-ce pas? </P>
<P> II. </P>
<P> &quot;MY LORD,&#8212;In reply to your demand for Miss Griffin's hand, in 
 favor of your son, Mr. Algernon Deuceace, I can only repeat what I 
 before have been under the necessity of stating to you,&#8212;that I do 
 not believe a union with a person of Mr. Deuceace's character would 
 conduce to my stepdaughter's happiness, and therefore REFUSE MY 
 CONSENT.  I will beg you to communicate the contents of this note  to 
Mr. Deuceace; and implore you no more to touch upon a subject  which 
you must be aware is deeply painful to me. </P>
<P> &quot;I remain your lordship's most humble servant, </P>
<P> &quot;L. E. GRIFFIN. </P>
<P> &quot;THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF CRABS.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Hang her ladyship!&quot; says my master, &quot;what care I for it?&quot;  As for 
 the old lord who'd been so afishous in his kindness and advice, 
 master recknsiled that pretty well, with thinking that his lordship 
 knew he was going to marry ten thousand a year, and igspected to  get 
some share of it; for he roat back the following letter to his  father, 
as well as a flaming one to Miss: </P>
<P> &quot;Thank you, my dear father, for your kindness in that awkward 
 business.  You know how painfully I am situated just now, and can 
 pretty well guess BOTH THE CAUSES of my disquiet.  A marriage with  my 
beloved Matilda will make me the happiest of men.  The dear girl 
 consents, and laughs at the foolish pretensions of her mother-in- 
 law.  To tell you the truth, I wonder she yielded to them so long. 
 Carry your kindness a step further, and find for us a parson, a 
 license, and make us two into one.  We are both major, you know; so 
 that the ceremony of a guardian's consent is unnecessary. </P>
<P> &quot;Your affectionate </P>
<P> &quot;ALGERNON DEUCEACE. </P>
<P> &quot;How I regret that difference between us some time back!  Matters 
 are changed now, and shall be more still AFTER THE MARRIAGE.&quot; </P>
<P> I knew what my master meant,&#8212;that he would give the old lord the 
 money after he was married; and as it was probble that miss would  see 
the letter he roat, he made it such as not to let her see two  clearly 
into his present uncomfrable situation. </P>
<P> I took this letter along with the tender one for Miss, reading both 
 of 'em, in course, by the way.  Miss, on getting hers, gave an 
 inegspressable look with the white of her i's, kist the letter, and 
 prest it to her busm.  Lord Crabs read his quite calm, and then  they 
fell a-talking together; and told me to wait awhile, and I  should git 
an anser. </P>
<P> After a deal of counseltation, my lord brought out a card, and 
 there was simply written on it, </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
     To-morrow, at the Ambassador's, at Twelve.
</PRE>
<P> &quot;Carry that back to your master, Chawls,&quot; says he, &quot;and bid him not 
 to fail.&quot; </P>
<P> You may be sure I stept back to him pretty quick, and gave him the 
 card and the messinge.  Master looked sattasfied with both; but 
 suttnly not over happy; no man is the day before his marridge; much 
 more his marridge with a hump-back, Harriss though she be. </P>
<P> Well, as he was a-going to depart this bachelor life, he did what 
 every man in such suckmstances ought to do; he made his will,&#8212;that 
 is, he made a dispasition of his property, and wrote letters to his 
 creditors telling them of his lucky chance; and that after his 
 marridge he would sutnly pay them every stiver.  BEFORE, they must 
 know his povvaty well enough to be sure that paymint was out of the 
 question. </P>
<P> To do him justas, he seam'd to be inclined to do the thing that was 
 right, now that it didn't put him to any inkinvenients to do so. </P>
<P> &quot;Chawls,&quot; says he, handing me over a tenpun-note, &quot;here's your 
 wagis, and thank you for getting me out of the scrape with the 
 bailiffs: when you are married, you shall be my valet out of  liv'ry, 
and I'll treble your salary.&quot; </P>
<P> His vallit! praps his butler!  Yes, thought I, here's a chance&#8212;a 
 vallit to ten thousand a year.  Nothing to do but to shave him, and 
 read his notes, and let my whiskers grow; to dress in spick and  span 
black, and a clean shut per day; muffings every night in the 
 housekeeper's room; the pick of the gals in the servants' hall; a 
 chap to clean my boots for me, and my master's opera bone reglar  once 
a week.  I knew what a vallit was as well as any genlmn in  service; 
and this I can tell you, he's genrally a hapier, idler,  handsomer, mor 
genlmnly man than his master.  He has more money to  spend, for genlmn 
WILL leave their silver in their waistcoat  pockets; more suxess among 
the gals; as good dinners, and as good  wine&#8212;that is, if he's friends 
with the butler: and friends in  corse they will be if they know which 
way their interest lies. </P>
<P> But these are only cassels in the air, what the French call shutter 
 d'Espang.  It wasn't roat in the book of fate that I was to be Mr. 
 Deuceace's vallit. </P>
<P> Days will pass at last&#8212;even days befor a wedding, (the longist and 
 unpleasantist day in the whole of a man's life, I can tell you, 
 excep, may be, the day before his hanging); and at length Aroarer 
 dawned on the suspicious morning which was to unite in the bonds of 
 Hyming the Honrable Algernon Percy Deuceace, Exquire, and Miss 
 Matilda Griffin.  My master's wardrobe wasn't so rich as it had  been; 
for he'd left the whole of his nicknax and trumpry of  dressing-cases 
and rob dy shams, his bewtifle museum of varnished  boots, his curous 
colleckshn of Stulz and Staub coats, when he had  been ableaged to quit 
so suddnly our pore dear lodginx at the Hotel  Mirabew; and being incog 
at a friend's house, ad contentid himself  with ordring a coople of 
shoots of cloves from a common tailor,  with a suffishnt quantaty of 
linning. </P>
<P> Well, he put on the best of his coats&#8212;a blue; and I thought it my 
 duty to ask him whether he'd want his frock again: he was good 
 natured and said, &quot;Take it and be hanged to you.&quot;  Half-past eleven 
 o'clock came, and I was sent to look out at the door, if there were 
 any suspicious charicters (a precious good nose I have to find a 
 bailiff out, I can tell you, and an i which will almost see one  round 
a corner); and presenly a very modest green glass coach  droave up, and 
in master stept.  I didn't in corse, appear on the  box; because, being 
known, my appearints might have compromised  master.  But I took a 
short cut, and walked as quick as posbil down  to the Rue de Foburg St. 
Honore, where his exlnsy the English  ambasdor lives, and where 
marridges are always performed betwigst  English folk at Paris. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> There is, almost nex door to the ambasdor's hotel, another hotel, 
 of that lo kind which the French call cabbyrays, or wine-houses;  and 
jest as master's green glass-coach pulled up, another coach  drove off, 
out of which came two ladies, whom I knew pretty well,&#8212;  suffiz, that 
one had a humpback, and the ingenious reader will know  why SHE came 
there; the other was poor Miss Kicksey, who came to  see her turned 
off. </P>
<P> Well, master's glass-coach droav up, jest as I got within a few 
 yards of the door; our carridge, I say, droav up, and stopt.  Down 
 gits coachmin to open the door, and comes I to give Mr. Deuceace an 
 arm, when out of the cabaray shoot four fellows, and draw up  betwigst 
the coach and embassy-doar; two other chaps go to the  other doar of 
the carridge, and, opening it, one says&#8212;&quot;Rendez-  vous, M. Deuceace! 
 Je vous arrete au nom de la loi!&quot; (which means,  &quot;Get out of that, Mr. 
D.; you are nabbed and no mistake.&quot;)  Master  turned gashly pail, and 
sprung to the other side of the coach, as  if a serpint had stung him. 
 He flung open the door, and was for  making off that way; but he saw 
the four chaps standing betwigst  libbarty and him.  He slams down the 
front window, and screams out,  &quot;Fouettez, cocher!&quot; (which means, &quot;Go 
it, coachmm!&quot; in a despert  loud voice; but coachmin wooden go it, and 
besides was off his box. </P>
<P> The long and short of the matter was, that jest as I came up to the 
 door two of the bums jumped into the carridge.  I saw all; I knew  my 
duty, and so very mornfly I got up behind. </P>
<P> &quot;Tiens,&quot; says one of the chaps in the street; &quot;c'est ce drole qui 
 nous a floure l'autre jour.&quot;  I knew 'em, but was too melumcolly to 
 smile. </P>
<P> &quot;Ou irons-nous donc?&quot; says coachmin to the genlmn who had got 
 inside. </P>
<P> A deep woice from the intearor shouted out, in reply to the 
 coachmin, &quot;A SAINTE PELAGIE!&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> And now, praps, I ot to dixcribe to you the humors of the prizn of 
 Sainte Pelagie, which is the French for Fleat, or Queen's Bentch:  but 
on this subject I'm rather shy of writing, partly because the  admiral 
Boz has, in the history of Mr. Pickwick, made such a  dixcripshun of a 
prizn, that mine wooden read very amyousingly  afterwids; and, also, 
because, to tell you the truth, I didn't stay  long in it, being not in 
a humer to waist my igsistance by passing  away the ears of my youth in 
such a dull place. </P>
<P> My fust errint now was, as you may phansy, to carry a noat from 
 master to his destined bride.  The poar thing was sadly taken  aback, 
as I can tell you, when she found, after remaining two hours  at the 
Embassy, that her husband didn't make his appearance.  And  so, after 
staying on and on, and yet seeing no husband, she was  forsed at last 
to trudge dishconslit home, where I was already  waiting for her with a 
letter from my master. </P>
<P> There was no use now denying the fact of his arrest, and so he 
 confest it at onst: but he made a cock-and-bull story of treachery  of 
a friend, infimous fodgery, and heaven knows what.  However, it  didn't 
matter much; if he had told her that he had been betrayed by  the man 
in the moon, she would have bleavd him. </P>
<P> Lady Griffin never used to appear now at any of my visits.  She kep 
 one drawing-room, and Miss dined and lived alone in another; they 
 quarld so much that praps it was best they should live apart; only  my 
Lord Crabs used to see both, comforting each with that winning  and 
innsnt way he had.  He came in as Miss, in tears, was lisning  to my 
account of master's seazure, and hoping that the prisn wasn't  a horrid 
place, with a nasty horrid dunjeon, and a dreadfle jailer,  and nasty 
horrid bread and water.  Law bless us! she had borrod her  ideers from 
the novvles she had been reading! </P>
<P> &quot;O my lord, my lord,&quot; says she, &quot;have you heard this fatal story?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Dearest Matilda, what?  For heaven's sake, you alarm me!  What&#8212; 
 yes&#8212;no&#8212;is it&#8212;no, it can't be!  Speak!&quot; says my lord, seizing me  by 
the choler of my coat.  &quot;What has happened to my boy?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Please you, my lord,&quot; says I, &quot;he's at this moment in prisn, no 
 wuss,&#8212;having been incarserated about two hours ago.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;In prison!  Algernon in prison! 'tis impossible!  Imprisoned, for 
 what sum?  Mention it, and I will pay to the utmost farthing in my 
 power.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I'm sure your lordship is very kind,&quot; says I (recklecting the sean 
 betwixgst him and master, whom he wanted to diddil out of a  thowsand 
lb.); &quot;and you'll he happy to hear he's only in for a  trifle.  Five 
thousand pound is, I think, pretty near the mark.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Five thousand pounds!&#8212;confusion!&quot; says my lord, clasping his 
 hands, and looking up to heaven, &quot;and I have not five hundred! 
 Dearest Matilda, how shall we help him?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Alas, my lord, I have but three guineas, and you know how Lady 
 Griffin has the&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, my sweet child, I know what you would say; but be of good 
 cheer&#8212;Algernon, you know, has ample funds of his own.&quot; </P>
<P> Thinking my lord meant Dawkins's five thousand, of which, to be 
 sure, a good lump was left, I held my tung; but I cooden help 
 wondering at Lord Crabs's igstream compashn for his son, and Miss, 
 with her 10,000L. a year, having only 3 guineas is her pockit. </P>
<P> I took home (bless us, what a home!) a long and very inflamble 
 letter from Miss, in which she dixscribed her own sorror at the 
 disappointment; swoar she lov'd him only the moar for his  misfortns; 
made light of them; as a pusson for a paltry sum of five  thousand 
pound ought never to be cast down, 'specially as he had a  certain 
independence in view; and vowed that nothing, nothing,  should ever 
injuice her to part from him, etsettler, etsettler. </P>
<P> I told master of the conversation which had past betwigst me and my 
 lord, and of his handsome offers, and his horrow at hearing of his 
 son's being taken; and likewise mentioned how strange it was that 
 Miss should only have 3 guineas, and with such a fortn: bless us, I 
 should have thot that she would always have carried a hundred  thowsnd 
lb. in her pockit! </P>
<P> At this master only said Pshaw!  But the rest of the story about 
 his father seemed to dixquiet him a good deal, and he made me  repeat 
it over agin. </P>
<P> He walked up and down the room agytated, and it seam'd as if a new 
 lite was breaking in upon him. </P>
<P> &quot;Chawls,&quot; says he, &quot;did you observe&#8212;did Miss&#8212;did my father seem 
 PARTICULARLY INTIMATE with Miss Griffin?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;How do you mean, sir?&quot; says I. </P>
<P> &quot;Did Lord Crabs appear very fond of Miss Griffin?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He was suttnly very kind to her.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Come, sir, speak at once: did Miss Griffin seem very fond of his 
 lordship?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, to tell the truth, sir, I must say she seemed VERY fond of 
 him.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What did he call her?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He called her his dearest gal.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Did he take her hand?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, and he&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And he what?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He kist her, and told her not to be so wery down-hearted about the 
 misfortn which had hapnd to you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I have it now!&quot; says he, clinching his fist, and growing gashly 
 pail&#8212;&quot;I have it now&#8212;the infernal old hoary scoundrel! the wicked, 
 unnatural wretch!  He would take her from me!&quot;  And he poured out a 
 volley of oaves which are impossbill to be repeatid here. </P>
<P> I thot as much long ago: and when my lord kem with his vizits so 
 pretious affeckshnt at my Lady Griffinses, I expected some such  game 
was in the wind.  Indeed, I'd heard a somethink of it from the 
 Griffinses servnts, that my lord was mighty tender with the ladies. </P>
<P> One thing, however, was evident to a man of his intleckshal 
 capassaties; he must either marry the gal at onst, or he stood very 
 small chance of having her.  He must get out of limbo immediantly,  or 
his respectid father might be stepping into his vaykint shoes.  Oh! he 
saw it all now&#8212;the fust attempt at arest, the marridge fixt  at 12 
o'clock, and the bayliffs fixt to come and intarup the  marridge!&#8212;the 
jewel, praps, betwigst him and De l'Orge: but no, it  was the WOMAN who 
did that&#8212;a MAN don't deal such fowl blows,  igspecially a father to 
his son: a woman may, poar thing!&#8212;she's no  other means of reventch, 
and is used to fight with underhand wepns  all her life through. </P>
<P> Well, whatever the pint might be, this Deuceace saw pretty clear 
 that he'd been beat by his father at his own game&#8212;a trapp set for 
 him onst, which had been defitted by my presnts of mind&#8212;another  trap 
set afterwids, in which my lord had been suxesfle.  Now, my  lord, roag 
as he was, was much too good-natured to do an unkind  ackshn, mearly 
for the sake of doing it.  He'd got to that pich  that he didn't mind 
injaries&#8212;they were all fair play to him&#8212;he  gave 'em, and reseav'd 
them, without a thought of mallis.  If he  wanted to injer his son, it 
was to benefick himself.  And how was  this to he done?  By getting the 
hairiss to himself, to be sure.  The Honrabble Mr. D. didn't say so; 
but I knew his feelinx well  enough&#8212;he regretted that he had not given 
the old genlmn the money  he askt for. </P>
<P> Poar fello! he thought he had hit it; but he was wide of the mark 
 after all. </P>
<P> Well, but what was to be done?  It was clear that he must marry the 
 gal at any rate&#8212;cootky coot, as the French say: that is, marry  her, 
and hang the igspence. </P>
<P> To do so he must first git out of prisn&#8212;to get out of prisn he 
 must pay his debts&#8212;and to pay his debts, he must give every  shilling 
he was worth.  Never mind: four thousand pound is a small  stake to a 
reglar gambler, igspecially when he must play it, or rot  for life in 
prisn; and when, if he plays it well, it will give him  ten thousand a 
year. </P>
<P> So, seeing there was no help for it, he maid up his mind, and 
 accordingly wrote the follying letter to Miss Griffin:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;MY ADORED MATILDA,&#8212;Your letter has indeed been a comfort to a 
 poor fellow, who had hoped that this night would have been the most 
 blessed in his life, and now finds himself condemned to spend it 
 within a prison wall!  You know the accursed conspiracy which has 
 brought these liabilities upon me, and the foolish friendship which 
 has cost me so much.  But what matters!  We have, as you say,  enough, 
even though I must pay this shameful demand upon me; and  five thousand 
pounds are as nothing, compared to the happiness  which I lose in being 
separated a night from thee!  Courage,  however!  If I make a sacrifice 
it is for you; and I were heartless  indeed if I allowed my own losses 
to balance for a moment against  your happiness. </P>
<P> &quot;Is it not so, beloved one?  IS not your happiness bound up with 
 mine, in a union with me?  I am proud to think so&#8212;proud, too, to 
 offer such a humble proof as this of the depth and purity of my 
 affection. </P>
<P> &quot;Tell me that you will still be mine; tell me that you will be mine 
 tomorrow; and to-morrow these vile chains shall be removed, and I 
 will be free once more&#8212;or if bound, only bound to you!  My  adorable 
Matilda! my betrothed bride!  Write to me ere the evening  closes, for 
I shall never be able to shut my eyes in slumber upon  my prison couch, 
until they have been first blessed by the sight of  a few words from 
thee!  Write to me, love! write to me!  I languish  for the reply which 
is to make or mar me for ever.  Your affectionate </P>
<P> &quot;A. P. D.&quot; </P>
<P> Having polisht off this epistol, master intrustid it to me to 
 carry, and bade me at the same time to try and give it into Miss 
 Griffin's hand alone.  I ran with it to Lady Griffinses.  I found 
 Miss, as I desired, in a sollatary condition; and I presented her 
 with master's pafewmed Billy. </P>
<P> She read it, and the number of size to which she gave vint, and the 
 tears which she shed, beggar digscription.  She wep and sighed  until 
I thought she would bust.  She even claspt my hand in her's,  and said, 
&quot;O Charles! is he very, very miserable?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He is, ma'am,&quot; says I; &quot;very miserable indeed&#8212;nobody, upon my 
 honor, could be miserablerer.&quot; </P>
<P> On hearing this pethetic remark, her mind was made up at onst: and 
 sitting down to her eskrewtaw, she immediantly ableaged master with 
 an answer.  Here it is in black and white: </P>
<P> &quot;My prisoned bird shall pine no more, but fly home to its nest in 
 these arms!  Adored Algernon, I will meet thee to-morrow, at the  same 
place, at the same hour.  Then, then, it will be impossible  for aught 
but death to divide us. </P>
<P> &quot;M. G.&quot; </P>
<P> This kind of flumry style comes, you see, of reading novvles, and 
 cultivating littery purshuits in a small way.  How much better is  it 
to be puffickly ignorant of the hart of writing, and to trust to  the 
writing of the heart.  This is MY style: artyfiz I despise, and  trust 
compleatly to natur: but revnong a no mootong, as our  continential 
friends remark: to that nice white sheep, Algernon  Percy Deuceace, 
Exquire; that wenrabble old ram, my Lord Crabs his  father; and that 
tender and dellygit young lamb, Miss Matilda  Griffin. </P>
<P> She had just foalded up into its proper triangular shape the noat 
 transcribed abuff, and I was just on the point of saying, according 
 to my master's orders, &quot;Miss, if you please, the Honrabble Mr. 
 Deuceace would be very much ableaged to you to keep the seminary 
 which is to take place to-morrow a profound se&#8212;,&quot; when my master's 
 father entered, and I fell back to the door.  Miss, without a word, 
 rusht into his arms, burst into teers agin, as was her reglar way  (it 
must be confest she was of a very mist constitution), and  showing to 
him his son's note, cried, &quot;Look, my dear lord, how  nobly your 
Algernon, OUR Algernon, writes to me.  Who can doubt,  after this, of 
the purity of his matchless affection?&quot; </P>
<P> My lord took the letter, read it, seamed a good deal amyoused, and 
 returning it to its owner, said, very much to my surprise, &quot;My dear 
 Miss Griffin, he certainly does seem in earnest; and if you choose  to 
make this match without the consent of your mother-in-law, you  know 
the consequence, and are of course your own mistress.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Consequences!&#8212;for shame, my lord!  A little money, more or less, 
 what matters it to two hearts like ours?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Hearts are very pretty things, my sweet young lady, but Three-per- 
 Cents are better.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Nay, have we not an ample income of our own, without the aid of 
 Lady Griffin?&quot; </P>
<P> My lord shrugged his shoulders.  &quot;Be it so, my love,&quot; says he. 
 &quot;I'm sure I can have no other reason to prevent a union which is 
 founded upon such disinterested affection.&quot; </P>
<P> And here the conversation dropt.  Miss retired, clasping her hands, 
 and making play with the whites of her i's.  My lord began trotting 
 up and down the room, with his fat hands stuck in his britchis 
 pockits, his countnince lighted up with igstream joy, and singing,  to 
my inordnit igstonishment: </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
     &quot;See the conquering hero comes!
      Tiddy diddy doll&#8212;tiddy doll, doll, doll.&quot;
</PRE>
<P> He began singing this song, and tearing up and down the room like 
 mad.  I stood amazd&#8212;a new light broke in upon me.  He wasn't  going, 
then, to make love to Miss Griffin!  Master might marry her!  Had she 
not got the for&#8212;? </P>
<P> I say, I was just standing stock still, my eyes fixt, my hands 
 puppindicklar, my mouf wide open and these igstrordinary thoughts 
 passing in my mind, when my lord having got to the last &quot;doll&quot; of  his 
song, just as I came to the sillible &quot;for&quot; of my ventriloquism,  or 
inward speech&#8212;we had eatch jest reached the pint digscribed,  when the 
meditations of both were sudnly stopt, by my lord, in the  midst of his 
singin and trottin match, coming bolt up aginst poar  me, sending me up 
aginst one end of the room, himself flying back  to the other: and it 
was only after considrabble agitation that we  were at length restored 
to anything like a liquilibrium. </P>
<P> &quot;What, YOU here, you infernal rascal?&quot; says my lord. </P>
<P> &quot;Your lordship's very kind to notus me,&quot; says I; &quot;I am here.&quot;  And 
 I gave him a look. </P>
<P> He saw I knew the whole game. </P>
<P> And after whisling a bit, as was his habit when puzzled (I bleave 
 he'd have only whisled if he had been told he was to be hanged in 
 five minits), after whisling a bit, he stops sudnly, and coming up  to 
me, says: </P>
<P> &quot;Hearkye, Charles, this marriage must take place to-morrow.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Must it, sir?&quot; says I; &quot;now, for my part, I don't think&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Stop, my good fellow; if it does not take place, what do you 
 gain?&quot; </P>
<P> This stagger'd me.  If it didn't take place, I only lost a 
 situation, for master had but just enough money to pay his detts;  and 
it wooden soot my book to serve him in prisn or starving. </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says my lord, &quot;you see the force of my argument.  Now, look 
 here!&quot; and he lugs out a crisp, fluttering, snowy HUNDRED-PUN NOTE! 
 &quot;If my son and Miss Griffin are married to-morrow, you shall have 
 this; and I will, moreover, take you into my service, and give you 
 double your present wages.&quot; </P>
<P> Flesh and blood cooden bear it.  &quot;My lord,&quot; says I, laying my hand 
 upon my busm, &quot;only give me security, and I'm yours for ever.&quot; </P>
<P> The old noblemin grin'd, and pattid me on the shoulder.  &quot;Right, my 
 lad,&quot; says he, &quot;right&#8212;you're a nice promising youth.  Here is the 
 best security.&quot;  And he pulls out his pockit-book, returns the 
 hundred-pun bill, and takes out one for fifty.  &quot;Here is half to- 
 day; to-morrow you shall have the remainder.&quot; </P>
<P> My fingers trembled a little as I took the pretty fluttering bit of 
 paper, about five times as big as any sum of money I had ever had  in 
my life.  I cast my i upon the amount: it was a fifty sure  enough&#8212;a 
bank poss-bill, made payable to Leonora Emilia Griffin,  and indorsed 
by her.  The cat was out of the bag.  Now, gentle  reader, I spose you 
begin to see the game. </P>
<P> &quot;Recollect, from this day you are in my service.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;My lord, you overpoar me with your faviors.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Go to the devil, sir,&quot; says he: &quot;do your duty, and hold your 
 tongue.&quot; </P>
<P> And thus I went from the service of the Honorabble Algernon 
 Deuceace to that of his exlnsy the Right Honorabble Earl of Crabs. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> On going back to prisn, I found Deuceace locked up in that oajus 
 place to which his igstravygansies had deservedly led him; and felt 
 for him, I must say, a great deal of contemp.  A raskle such as he&#8212; 
 a swindler, who had robbed poar Dawkins of the means of igsistance; 
 who had cheated his fellow-roag, Mr. Richard Blewitt, and who was 
 making a musnary marridge with a disgusting creacher like Miss 
 Griffin, didn merit any compashn on my purt; and I determined quite 
 to keep secret the suckmstansies of my privit intervew with his 
 exlnsy my presnt master. </P>
<P> I gev him Miss Griffinses trianglar, which he read with a satasfied 
 air.  Then, turning to me, says he: &quot;You gave this to Miss Griffin 
 alone?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You gave her my message?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And you are quite sure Lord Crabs was not there when you gave 
 either the message or the note?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Not there upon my honor,&quot; says I. </P>
<P> &quot;Hang your honor, sir!  Brush my hat and coat, and go CALL A 
COACH&#8212;  do you hear?&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> I did as I was ordered; and on coming back found master in what's 
 called, I think, the greffe of the prisn.  The officer in waiting  had 
out a great register, and was talking to master in the French  tongue, 
in coarse; a number of poar prisners were looking eagerly  on. </P>
<P> &quot;Let us see, my lor,&quot; says he; &quot;the debt is 98,700 francs; there 
 are capture expenses, interest so much; and the whole sum amounts  to 
a hundred thousand francs, moins 13.&quot; </P>
<P> Deuceace, in a very myjestic way, takes out of his pocketbook four 
 thowsnd pun notes.  &quot;This is not French money, but I presume that  you 
know it, M. Greffier,&quot; says he. </P>
<P> The greffier turned round to old Solomon, a money-changer, who had 
 one or two clients in the prisn, and hapnd luckily to be there.  &quot;Les 
billets sont bons,&quot; says he.  &quot;Je les prendrai pour cent mille  douze 
cent francs, et j'espere, my lor, de vous revoir.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Good,&quot; says the greffier; &quot;I know them to be good, and I will give 
 my lor the difference, and make out his release.&quot; </P>
<P> Which was done.  The poar debtors gave a feeble cheer, as the great 
 dubble iron gates swung open and clang to again, and Deuceace stept 
 out and me after him, to breathe the fresh hair. </P>
<P> He had been in the place but six hours, and was now free again&#8212; 
 free, and to be married to ten thousand a year nex day.  But, for  all 
that, he lookt very faint and pale.  He HAD put down his great  stake; 
and when he came out of Sainte Pelagie, he had but fifty  pounds left 
in the world! </P>
<P> Never mind&#8212;when onst the money's down, make your mind easy; and so 
 Deuceace did.  He drove back to the Hotel Mirabew, where he ordered 
 apartmince infinately more splendid than befor; and I pretty soon 
 told Toinette, and the rest of the suvvants, how nobly he behayved, 
 and how he valyoud four thousnd pound no more than ditch water.  And 
such was the consquincies of my praises, and the poplarity I  got for 
us boath, that the delighted landlady immediantly charged  him dubble 
what she would have done, if it hadn been for my stoaries. </P>
<P> He ordered splendid apartmince, then, for the nex week; a carridge- 
 and-four for Fontainebleau to-morrow at 12 precisely; and having 
 settled all these things, went quietly to the &quot;Roshy de Cancale,&quot; 
 where he dined: as well he might, for it was now eight o'clock.  I 
 didn't spare the shompang neither that night, I can tell you; for 
 when I carried the note he gave me for Miss Griffin in the evening, 
 informing her of his freedom, that young lady remarked my hagitated 
 manner of walking and speaking, and said, &quot;Honest Charles! he is 
 flusht with the events of the day.  Here, Charles, is a napoleon; 
 take it and drink to your mistress.&quot; </P>
<P> I pockitid it; but, I must say, I didn't like the money&#8212;it went 
 against my stomick to take it. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_9">CHAPTER IX. THE MARRIAGE.</A></H3>
<P> Well, the nex day came: at 12 the carridge-and-four was waiting at 
 the ambasdor's doar; and Miss Griffin and the faithfle Kicksey were 
 punctial to the apintment. </P>
<P> I don't wish to digscribe the marridge seminary&#8212;how the embasy 
 chapling jined the hands of this loving young couple&#8212;how one of  the 
embasy footmin was called in to witness the marridge&#8212;how Miss  wep and 
fainted as usial&#8212;and how Deuceace carried her, fainting,  to the 
brisky, and drove off to Fontingblo, where they were to pass  the fust 
weak of the honey-moon.  They took no servnts, because  they wisht, 
they said, to be privit.  And so, when I had shut up  the steps, and 
bid the postilion drive on, I bid ajew to the  Honrabble Algernon, and 
went off strait to his exlent father. </P>
<P> &quot;Is it all over, Chawls?&quot; said he. </P>
<P> &quot;I saw them turned off at igsactly a quarter past 12, my lord,&quot; 
 says I. </P>
<P> &quot;Did you give Miss Griffin the paper, as I told you, before her 
 marriage?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I did, my lord, in the presents of Mr. Brown, Lord Bobtail's man; 
 who can swear to her having had it.&quot; </P>
<P> I must tell you that my lord had made me read a paper which Lady 
 Griffin had written, and which I was comishnd to give in the manner 
 menshnd abuff.  It ran to this effect:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;According to the authority given me by the will of my late dear 
 husband, I forbid the marriage of Miss Griffin with the Honorable 
 Algernon Percy Deuceace.  If Miss Griffin persists in the union, I 
 warn her that she must abide by the consequences of her act. </P>
<P> &quot;LEONORA EMILIA GRIFFIN.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;RUE DE RIVOLI, May 8, 1818.&quot; </P>
<P> When I gave this to Miss as she entered the cortyard, a minnit 
 before my master's arrivle, she only read it contemptiously, and 
 said, &quot;I laugh at the threats of Lady Griffin;&quot; and she toar the 
 paper in two, and walked on, leaning on the arm of the faithful and 
 obleaging Miss Kicksey. </P>
<P> I picked up the paper for fear of axdents, and brot it to my lord. 
 Not that there was any necessaty; for he'd kep a copy, and made me 
 and another witniss (my Lady Griffin's solissator) read them both, 
 before he sent either away. </P>
<P> &quot;Good!&quot; says he; and he projuiced from his potfolio the fello of 
 that bewchus fifty-pun note, which he'd given me yesterday.  &quot;I  keep 
my promise, you see, Charles,&quot; says he.  &quot;You are now in Lady 
 Griffin's service, in the place of Mr. Fitzclarence, who retires.  Go 
to Froje's, and get a livery.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But, my lord,&quot; says I, &quot;I was not to go into Lady Griffnses 
 service, according to the bargain, but into&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It's all the same thing,&quot; says he; and he walked off.  I went to 
 Mr. Froje's, and ordered a new livry; and found, likwise, that our 
 coachmin and Munseer Mortimer had been there too.  My lady's livery 
 was changed, and was now of the same color as my old coat at Mr. 
 Deuceace's; and I'm blest if there wasn't a tremenjious great  earl's 
corronit on the butins, instid of the Griffin rampint, which  was worn 
befoar. </P>
<P> I asked no questions, however, but had myself measured; and slep 
 that night at the Plas Vandome.  I didn't go out with the carridge 
 for a day or two, though; my lady only taking one footmin, she  said, 
until HER NEW CARRIDGE was turned out. </P>
<P> I think you can guess what's in the wind NOW! </P>
<P> I bot myself a dressing-case, a box of Ody colong, a few duzen lawn 
 sherts and neckcloths, and other things which were necessary for a 
 genlmn in my rank.  Silk stockings was provided by the rules of the 
 house.  And I completed the bisniss by writing the follying ginteel 
 letter to my late master:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;CHARLES YELLOWPLUSH, ESQUIRE, TO THE HONORABLE A. P. DEUCEACE. </P>
<P> &quot;SUR,&#8212;Suckmstansies have acurd sins I last had the honner of 
 wating on you, which render it impossbil that I should remane any 
 longer in your suvvice.  I'll thank you to leave out my thinx, when 
 they come home on Sattady from the wash. </P>
<P> &quot;Your obeajnt servnt, </P>
<P> &quot;CHARLES YELLOWPLUSH.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;PLAS VENDOME.&quot; </P>
<P> The athography of the abuv noat, I confess, is atrocious; but ke 
 voolyvoo?  I was only eighteen, and hadn then the expearance in 
 writing which I've enjide sins. </P>
<P> Having thus done my jewty in evry way, I shall prosead, in the nex 
 chapter, to say what hapnd in my new place. </P>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_3_10">CHAPTER X. THE HONEY-MOON.</A></H3>
<P> The weak at Fontingblow past quickly away; and at the end of it, 
 our son and daughter-in-law&#8212;a pare of nice young tuttle-duvs&#8212; 
 returned to their nest, at the Hotel Mirabew.  I suspeck that the 
 COCK turtle-dove was preshos sick of his barging. </P>
<P> When they arriv'd, the fust thing they found on their table was a 
 large parsle wrapt up in silver paper, and a newspaper, and a  couple 
of cards, tied up with a peace of white ribbing.  In the  parsle was a 
hansume piece of plum-cake, with a deal of sugar.  On  the cards was 
wrote, in Goffick characters, </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
     Earl of Crabs.</PRE>
<P> And, in very small Italian, </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
     Countess of Crabs.</PRE>
<P> And in the paper was the following parrowgraff:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.&#8212;Yesterday, at the British embassy, the 
 Right Honorable John Augustus Altamont Plantagenet, Earl of Crabs,  to 
Leonora Emilia, widow of the late Lieutenant-General Sir George 
 Griffin, K. C. B.  An elegant dejeune was given to the happy couple 
 by his Excellency Lord Bobtail, who gave away the bride.  The elite 
 of the foreign diplomacy, the Prince Talleyrand and Marshal the  Duke 
of Dalmatia on behalf of H. M. the King of France, honored the  banquet 
and the marriage ceremony.  Lord and Lady Crabs intend  passing a few 
weeks at Saint Cloud.&quot; </P>
<P> The above dockyments, along with my own triffling billy, of which I 
 have also givn a copy, greated Mr. and Mrs. Deuceace on their  arrivle 
from Fontingblo.  Not being present, I can't say what  Deuceace said; 
but I can fancy how he LOOKT, and how poor Mrs.  Deuceace lookt.  They 
weren't much inclined to rest after the  fiteeg of the junny; for, in 
1/2 an hour after their arrival at  Paris, the hosses were put to the 
carridge agen, and down they came  thundering to our country-house at 
St. Cloud (pronounst by those  absud Frenchmin Sing Kloo), to interrup 
our chaste loves and  delishs marridge injyments. </P>
<P> My lord was sittn in a crimson satan dressing-gown, lolling on a 
 sofa at an open windy, smoaking seagars, as ushle; her ladyship,  who, 
to du her justice, didn mind the smell, occupied another end  of the 
room, and was working, in wusted, a pare of slippers, or an  umbrellore 
case, or a coal-skittle, or some such nonsints.  You  would have 
thought to have sean 'em that they had been married a  sentry, at 
least.  Well, I bust in upon this conjugal tator-tator,  and said, very 
much alarmed, &quot;My lord, here's your son and  daughter-in-law.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well,&quot; says my lord, quite calm, &quot;and what then?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Deuceace!&quot; says my lady, starting up, and looking fritened. </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, my love, my son; but you need not be alarmed.  Pray, Charles, 
 say that Lady Crabs and I will be very happy to see Mr. and Mrs. 
 Deuceace; and that they must excuse us receiving them en famille.  Sit 
still, my blessing&#8212;take things coolly.  Have you got the box  with the 
papers?&quot; </P>
<P> My lady pointed to a great green box&#8212;the same from which she had 
 taken the papers, when Deuceace fust saw them,&#8212;and handed over to  my 
lord a fine gold key.  I went out, met Deuceace and his wife on  the 
stepps, gave my messinge, and bowed them palitely in. </P>
<P> My lord didn't rise, but smoaked away as usual (praps a little 
 quicker, but I can't say); my lady sat upright, looking handsum and 
 strong.  Deuceace walked in, his left arm tied to his breast, his 
 wife and hat on the other.  He looked very pale and frightened; his 
 wife, poar thing! had her head berried in her handkerchief, and  sobd 
fit to break her heart. </P>
<P> Miss Kicksey, who was in the room (but I didn't mention her, she 
 was less than nothink in our house), went up to Mrs. Deuceace at 
 onst, and held out her arms&#8212;she had a heart, that old Kicksey, and  I 
respect her for it.  The poor hunchback flung herself into Miss's 
 arms, with a kind of whooping screech, and kep there for some time, 
 sobbing in quite a historical manner.  I saw there was going to be  a 
sean, and so, in cors, left the door ajar. </P>
<P> &quot;Welcome to Saint Cloud, Algy my boy!&quot; says my lord, in a loud, 
 hearty voice.  &quot;You thought you would give us the slip, eh, you 
 rogue?  But we knew it, my dear fellow: we knew the whole affair&#8212; 
 did we not, my soul?&#8212;and you see, kept our secret better than you 
 did yours.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I must confess, sir,&quot; says Deuceace, bowing, &quot;that I had no idea 
 of the happiness which awaited me in the shape of a mother-in-law.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No, you dog; no, no,&quot; says my lord, giggling: &quot;old birds, you 
 know, not to be caught with chaff, like young ones.  But here we  are, 
all spliced and happy, at last.  Sit down, Algernon; let us  smoke a 
segar, and talk over the perils and adventures of the last  month.  My 
love,&quot; says my lord, turning to his lady, you have no  malice against 
poor Algernon, I trust?  Pray shake HIS HAND.&quot;  (A  grin.) </P>
<P> But my lady rose and said, &quot;I have told Mr. Deuceace, that I never 
 wished to see him, or speak to him, more.  I see no reason, now, to 
 change my opinion.&quot;  And herewith she sailed out of the room, by  the 
door through which Kicksey had carried poor Mrs. Deuceace. </P>
<P> &quot;Well, well,&quot; says my lord, as Lady Crabs swept by, &quot;I was in hopes 
 she had forgiven you; but I know the whole story, and I must  confess 
you used her cruelly ill.  Two strings to your bow!&#8212;that  was your 
game, was it, you rogue?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Do you mean, my lord, that you know all that past between me and 
 Lady Grif&#8212;Lady Crabs, before our quarrel?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Perfectly&#8212;you made love to her, and she was almost in love with 
 you; you jilted her for money, she got a man to shoot your hand off 
 in revenge: no more dice-boxes, now, Deuceace; no more sauter la 
 coupe.  I can't think how the deuce you will manage to live without 
 them.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Your lordship is very kind; but I have given up play altogether,&quot; 
 says Deuceace, looking mighty black and uneasy. </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, indeed!  Benedick has turned a moral man, has he?  This is 
 better and better.  Are you thinking of going into the church, 
 Deuceace?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;My lord, may I ask you to be a little more serious?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Serious! a quoi bon?  I am serious&#8212;serious in my surprise that, 
 when you might have had either of these women, you should have 
 preferred that hideous wife of yours.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;May I ask you, in turn, how you came to be so little squeamish 
 about a wife, as to choose a woman who had just been making love to 
 your own son?&quot; says Deuceace, growing fierce. </P>
<P> &quot;How can you ask such a question?  I owe forty thousand pounds&#8212; 
 there is an execution at Sizes Hall&#8212;every acre I have is in the 
 hands of my creditors; and that's why I married her.  Do you think 
 there was any love?  Lady Crabs is a dev'lish fine woman, but she's 
 not a fool&#8212;she married me for my coronet, and I married her for  her 
money.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, my lord, you need not ask me, I think, why I married the 
 daughter-in-law.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, but I DO, my dear boy.  How the deuce are you to live? 
 Dawkins's five thousand pounds won't last forever; and afterwards?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You don't mean, my lord&#8212;you don't&#8212;I mean, you can't&#8212;  D&#8212;-!&quot; 
 says he, starting up, and losing all patience, &quot;you don't dare to  say 
that Miss Griffin had not a fortune of ten thousand a year?&quot; </P>
<P> My lord was rolling up, and wetting betwigst his lips, another 
 segar; he lookt up, after he had lighted it, and said quietly&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;Certainly, Miss Griffin had a fortune of ten thousand a year.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, sir, and has she not got it now?  Has she spent it in a 
 week?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;SHE HAS NOT GOT A SIX-PENCE NOW: SHE MARRIED WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S 
 CONSENT!&quot; </P>
<P> Deuceace sunk down in a chair; and I never see such a dreadful 
 picture of despair as there was in the face of that retchid man!&#8212;  he 
writhed, and nasht his teeth, he tore open his coat, and  wriggled 
madly the stump of his left hand, until, fairly beat, he  threw it over 
his livid pale face, and sinking backwards, fairly  wept alowd. </P>
<P> Bah! it's a dreddfle thing to hear a man crying! his pashn torn up 
 from the very roots of his heart, as it must be before it can git 
 such a vent.  My lord, meanwhile, rolled his segar, lighted it, and 
 went on. </P>
<P> &quot;My dear boy, the girl has not a shilling.  I wished to have left 
 you alone in peace, with your four thousand pounds: you might have 
 lived decently upon it in Germany, where money is at 5 per cent, 
 where your duns would not find you, and a couple of hundred a year 
 would have kept you and your wife in comfort.  But, you see, Lady 
 Crabs would not listen to it.  You had injured her; and, after she 
 had tried to kill you and failed, she determined to ruin you, and 
 succeeded.  I must own to you that I directed the arresting  business, 
and put her up to buying your protested bills: she got  them for a 
trifle, and as you have paid them, has made a good two  thousand pounds 
by her bargain.  It was a painful thing to be sure,  for a father to 
get his son arrested; but que voulez-vous!  I did  not appear in the 
transaction: she would have you ruined; and it  was absolutely 
necessary that YOU should marry before I could, so I  pleaded your 
cause with Miss Griffin, and made you the happy man  you are.  You 
rogue, you rogue! you thought to match your old  father, did you?  But, 
never mind; lunch will be ready soon.  In  the meantime, have a segar, 
and drink a glass of Sauterne.&quot; </P>
<P> Deuceace, who had been listening to this speech, sprung up wildly. </P>
<P> &quot;I'll not believe it,&quot; he said: &quot;it's a lie, an infernal lie! 
 forged by you, you hoary villain, and by the murderess and strumpet 
 you have married.  I'll not believe it; show me the will.  Matilda! 
 Matilda!&quot; shouted he, screaming hoarsely, and flinging open the  door 
by which she had gone out. </P>
<P> &quot;Keep your temper, my boy.  You ARE vexed, and I feel for you: but 
 don't use such bad language: it is quite needless, believe me.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Matilda!&quot; shouted out Deuceace again; and the poor crooked thing 
 came trembling in, followed by Miss Kicksey. </P>
<P> &quot;Is this true, woman?&quot; says he, clutching hold of her hand. </P>
<P> &quot;What, dear Algernon?&quot; says she. </P>
<P> &quot;What?&quot; screams out Deuceace,&#8212;&quot;what?  Why that you are a beggar, 
 for marrying without your mother's consent&#8212;that you basely lied to 
 me, in order to bring about this match&#8212;that you are a swindler, in 
 conspiracy with that old fiend yonder and the she-devil his wife?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It is true,&quot; sobbed the poor woman, &quot;that I have nothing; but&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Nothing but what?  Why don't you speak, you drivelling fool?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I have nothing!&#8212;but you, dearest, have two thousand a year.  Is 
 that not enough for us?  You love me for myself, don't you,  Algernon? 
 You have told me so a thousand times&#8212;say so again, dear  husband; and 
do not, do not be so unkind.&quot;  And here she sank on  her knees, and 
clung to him, and tried to catch his hand, and kiss  it. </P>
<P> &quot;How much did you say?&quot; says my lord. </P>
<P> &quot;Two thousand a year, sir; he has told us so a thousand times.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;TWO THOUSAND!  Two thou&#8212;ho, ho, ho!&#8212;haw! haw! haw!&quot; roars my 
 lord.  &quot;That is, I vow, the best thing I ever heard in my life.  My 
 dear creature, he has not a shilling&#8212;not a single maravedi, by all 
 the gods and goddesses.&quot;  And this exlnt noblemin began laffin  louder 
than ever: a very kind and feeling genlmn he was, as all  must confess. </P>
<P> There was a paws: and Mrs. Deuceace didn begin cussing and swearing 
 at her husband as he had done at her: she only said, &quot;O Algernon!  is 
this true?&quot; and got up, and went to a chair and wep in quiet. </P>
<P> My lord opened the great box.  &quot;If you or your lawyers would like 
 to examine Sir George's will, it is quite at your service; you will 
 see here the proviso which I mentioned, that gives the entire  fortune 
to Lady Griffin&#8212;Lady Crabs that is: and here, my dear boy,  you see 
the danger of hasty conclusions.  Her ladyship only showed  you the 
FIRST PAGE OF THE WILL, of course; she wanted to try you.  You thought 
you made a great stroke in at once proposing to Miss  Griffin&#8212;do not 
mind it, my love, he really loves you now very  sincerely!&#8212;when, in 
fact, you would have done much better to have  read the rest of the 
will.  You were completely bitten, my boy&#8212;  humbugged, bamboozled&#8212;ay, 
and by your old father, you dog.  I told  you I would, you know, when 
you refused to lend me a portion of  your Dawkins money.  I told you I 
would; and I DID.  I had you the  very next day.  Let this be a lesson 
to you, Percy my boy; don't  try your luck again against such old 
hands: look deuced well before  you leap: audi alteram partem, my lad, 
which means, read both sides  of the will.  I think lunch is ready; but 
I see you don't smoke.  Shall we go in?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Stop, my lord,&quot; says Mr. Deuceace, very humble: &quot;I shall not share 
 your hospitality&#8212;but&#8212;but you know my condition; I am penniless&#8212; 
 you know the manner in which my wife has been brought up&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;The Honorable Mrs. Deuceace, sir, shall always find a home here, 
 as if nothing had occurred to interrupt the friendship between her 
 dear mother and herself.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And for me, sir,&quot; says Deuceace, speaking faint, and very slow; &quot;I 
 hope&#8212;I trust&#8212;I think, my lord, you will not forget me?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Forget you, sir; certainly not.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And that you will make some provision&#8212;?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Algernon Deuceace,&quot; says my lord, getting up from the sophy, and 
 looking at him with sich a jolly malignity, as I never see, &quot;I 
 declare, before heaven, that I will not give you a penny!&quot; </P>
<P> Hereupon my lord held out his hand to Mrs. Deuceace, and said, &quot;My 
 dear, will you join your mother and me?  We shall always, as I  said, 
have a home for you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;My lord,&quot; said the poar thing, dropping a curtsy, &quot;my home is with 
 HIM!&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> About three months after, when the season was beginning at Paris, 
 and the autumn leafs was on the ground, my lord, my lady, me and 
 Mortimer, were taking a stroal in the Boddy Balong, the carridge 
 driving on slowly ahead, and us as happy as possbill, admiring the 
 pleasant woods and the goldn sunset. </P>
<P> My lord was expayshating to my lady upon the exquizit beauty of the 
 sean, and pouring forth a host of butifle and virtuous sentaments 
 sootable to the hour.  It was dalitefle to hear him.  &quot;Ah!&quot; said  he, 
&quot;black must be the heart, my love, which does not feel the  influence 
of a scene like this; gathering as it were, from those  sunlit skies, a 
portion of their celestial gold, and gaining  somewhat of heaven with 
each pure draught of this delicious air!&quot; </P>
<P> Lady Crabs did not speak, but prest his arm and looked upwards. 
 Mortimer and I, too, felt some of the infliwents of the sean, and 
 lent on our goold sticks in silence.  The carriage drew up close to 
 us, and my lord and my lady sauntered slowly tords it. </P>
<P> Jest at the place was a bench, and on the bench sate a poorly drest 
 woman, and by her, leaning against a tree, was a man whom I thought 
 I'd sean befor.  He was drest in a shabby blew coat, with white  seems 
and copper buttons; a torn hat was on his head, and great  quantaties 
of matted hair and whiskers disfiggared his countnints.  He was not 
shaved, and as pale as stone. </P>
<P> My lord and lady didn tak the slightest notice of him, but past on 
 to the carridge.  Me and Mortimer lickwise took OUR places.  As we 
 past, the man had got a grip of the woman's shoulder, who was  holding 
down her head sobbing bitterly. </P>
<P> No sooner were my lord and lady seated, than they both, with 
 igstream dellixy and good natur, burst into a ror of lafter, peal 
 upon peal, whooping and screaching enough to frighten the evening 
 silents. </P>
<P> DEUCEACE turned round.  I see his face now&#8212;the face of a devvle of 
 hell!  Fust, he lookt towards the carridge, and pinted to it with  his 
maimed arm; then he raised the other, AND STRUCK THE WOMAN BY  HIS 
SIDE.  She fell, screaming. </P>
<P> Poor thing!  Poor thing! </P>
<P></P>
<P> MR. YELLOWPLUSH'S AJEW. </P>
<P> The end of Mr. Deuceace's history is going to be the end of my 
 corrispondince.  I wish the public was as sory to part with me as I 
 am with the public; becaws I fansy reely that we've become frends, 
 and feal for my part a becoming greaf at saying ajew. </P>
<P> It's imposbill for me to continyow, however, a-writin, as I have 
 done&#8212;violetting the rules of authography, and trampling upon the 
 fust princepills of English grammar.  When I began, I knew no  better: 
when I'd carrid on these papers a little further, and grew  accustmd to 
writin, I began to smel out somethink quear in my  style.  Within the 
last sex weaks I have been learning to spell:  and when all the world 
was rejoicing at the festivvaties of our  youthful Quean&#8212;*when all i's 
were fixed upon her long sweet of  ambasdors and princes, following the 
splendid carridge of Marshle  the Duke of Damlatiar, and blinking at 
the pearls and dimince of  Prince Oystereasy&#8212;Yellowplush was in his 
loanly pantry&#8212;HIS eyes  were fixt upon the spelling-book&#8212;his heart 
was bent upon mastring  the diffickleties of the littery professhn.  I 
have been, in fact,  CONVERTID. </P>
<P> * This was written in 1838. </P>
<P> You shall here how.  Ours, you know, is a Wig house; and ever sins 
 his third son has got a place in the Treasury, his secknd a  captingsy 
in the Guards, his fust, the secretary of embasy at  Pekin, with a 
prospick of being appinted ambasdor at Loo Choo&#8212;ever  sins master's 
sons have reseaved these attentions, and master  himself has had the 
promis of a pearitch, he has been the most  reglar, consistnt, 
honrabble Libbaral, in or out of the House of  Commins. </P>
<P> Well, being a Whig, it's the fashn, as you know, to reseave littery 
 pipple; and accordingly, at dinner, tother day, whose name do you 
 think I had to hollar out on the fust landing-place about a wick  ago? 
 After several dukes and markises had been enounced, a very  gentell 
fly drives up to our doar, and out steps two gentlemen.  One was pail, 
and wor spektickles, a wig, and a white neckcloth.  The other was slim 
with a hook nose, a pail fase, a small waist, a  pare of falling 
shoulders, a tight coat, and a catarack of black  satting tumbling out 
of his busm, and falling into a gilt velvet  weskit.  The little genlmn 
settled his wigg, and pulled out his  ribbins; the younger one fluffed 
the dust of his shoes, looked at  his whiskers in a little pockit-glas, 
settled his crevatt; and they  both mounted upstairs. </P>
<P> &quot;What name, sir?&quot; says I, to the old genlmn. </P>
<P> &quot;Name!&#8212;a! now, you thief o' the wurrld,&quot; says he, &quot;do you pretind 
 nat to know ME?  Say it's the Cabinet Cyclopa&#8212;no, I mane the 
 Litherary Chran&#8212;psha!&#8212;bluthanowns!&#8212;say it's DOCTHOR DIOCLESIAN 
 LARNER&#8212;I think he'll know me now&#8212;ay, Nid?&quot;  But the genlmn called 
 Nid was at the botm of the stare, and pretended to be very busy  with 
his shoo-string.  So the little genlmn went upstares alone. </P>
<P> &quot;DOCTOR DIOLESIUS LARNER!&quot; says I. </P>
<P> &quot;DOCTOR ATHANASIUS LARDNER!&quot; says Greville Fitz-Roy, our secknd 
 footman, on the fust landing-place. </P>
<P> &quot;DOCTOR IGNATIUS LOYOLA!&quot; says the groom of the chambers, who 
 pretends to be a scholar; and in the little genlmn went.  When  safely 
housed, the other chap came; and when I asked him his name,  said, in a 
thick, gobbling kind of voice: </P>
<P> &quot;Sawedwadgeorgeearllittnbulwig.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Sir what?&quot; says I, quite agast at the name. </P>
<P> &quot;Sawedwad&#8212;no, I mean MISTAWedwad Lyttn Bulwig.&quot; </P>
<P> My neas trembled under me, my i's fild with tiers, my voice shook, 
 as I past up the venrabble name to the other footman, and saw this 
 fust of English writers go up to the drawing-room! </P>
<P> It's needless to mention the names of the rest of the compny, or to 
 dixcribe the suckmstansies of the dinner.  Suffiz to say that the  two 
littery genlmn behaved very well, and seamed to have good  appytights; 
igspecially the little Irishman in the whig, who et,  drunk, and talked 
as much as a duzn.  He told how he'd been  presented at cort by his 
friend, Mr. Bulwig, and how the Quean had  received 'em both, with a 
dignity undigscribable; and how her  blessid Majisty asked what was the 
bony fidy sale of the Cabinit  Cyclopaedy, and how be (Doctor Larner) 
told her that, on his  honner, it was under ten thowsnd. </P>
<P> You may guess that the Doctor, when he made this speach, was pretty 
 far gone.  The fact is, that whether it was the coronation, or the 
 goodness of the wine (cappitle it is in our house, I can tell you), 
 or the natral propensaties of the gests assembled, which made them  so 
igspecially jolly, I don't know; but they had kep up the meating 
 pretty late, and our poar butler was quite tired with the  perpechual 
baskits of clarrit which he'd been called upon to bring  up.  So that 
about 11 o'clock, if I were to say they were merry, I  should use a 
mild term; if I wer to say they were intawsicated, I  should use a 
nigspresshn more near to the truth, but less  rispeckful in one of my 
situashn. </P>
<P> The cumpany reseaved this annountsmint with mute extonishment. </P>
<P> &quot;Pray, Doctor Larnder,&quot; says a spiteful genlmn, willing to keep up 
 the littery conversation, &quot;what is the Cabinet Cyclopaedia?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It's the littherary wontherr of the wurrld,&quot; says he; &quot;and sure 
 your lordship must have seen it; the latther numbers ispicially&#8212; 
 cheap as durrt, bound in gleezed calico, six shillings a vollum.  The 
illusthrious neems of Walther Scott, Thomas Moore, Docther  Southey, 
Sir James Mackintosh, Docther Donovan, and meself, are to  be found in 
the list of conthributors.  It's the Phaynix of  Cyclopajies&#8212;a 
litherary Bacon.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;A what?&quot; says the genlmn nex to him. </P>
<P> &quot;A Bacon, shining in the darkness of our age; fild wid the pure end 
 lambent flame of science, burning with the gorrgeous scintillations 
 of divine litherature&#8212;a monumintum, in fact, are perinnius, bound  in 
pink calico, six shillings a vollum.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;This wigmawole,&quot; said Mr. Bulwig (who seemed rather disgusted that 
 his friend should take up so much of the convassation), &quot;this 
 wigmawole is all vewy well; but it's cuwious that you don't  wemember, 
in chawactewising the litewawy mewits of the vawious  magazines, 
cwonicles, weviews, and encyclopaedias, the existence of  a cwitical 
weview and litewary chwonicle, which, though the aewa of  its 
appeawance is dated only at a vewy few months pwevious to the  pwesent 
pewiod, is, nevertheless, so wemarkable for its intwinsic  mewits as to 
be wead, not in the metwopolis alone, but in the  countwy&#8212;not in 
Fwance merely, but in the west of Euwope&#8212;whewever  our pure Wenglish 
is spoken, it stwetches its peaceful sceptre&#8212;  pewused in Amewica, 
fwom New York to Ningawa&#8212;wepwinted in Canada,  from Montweal to 
Towonto&#8212;and, as I am gwatified to hear fwom my  fwend the governor of 
Cape Coast Castle, wegularly weceived in  Afwica, and twanslated into 
the Mandingo language by the  missionawies and the bushwangers.  I need 
not say, gentlemen&#8212;  sir&#8212;that is, Mr. Speaker&#8212;I mean, Sir John&#8212;that 
I allude to the  Litewary Chwonicle, of which I have the honor to be 
pwincipal  contwibutor.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Very true; my dear Mr. Bullwig,&quot; says my master: &quot;you and I being 
 Whigs, must of course stand by our own friends; and I will agree, 
 without a moment's hesitation, that the Literary what-d'ye-call'em  is 
the prince of periodicals.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;The pwince of pewiodicals?&quot; says Bullwig; &quot;my dear Sir John, it's 
 the empewow of the pwess.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Soit,&#8212;let it be the emperor of the press, as you poetically call 
 it: but, between ourselves, confess it,&#8212;Do not the Tory writers  beat 
your Whigs hollow?  You talk about magazines.  Look at&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Look at hwat?&quot; shouts out Larder.  &quot;There's none, Sir Jan, 
 compared to ourrs.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Pardon me, I think that&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It is 'Bentley's Mislany' you mane?&quot; says Ignatius, as sharp as a 
 niddle. </P>
<P> &quot;Why, no; but&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;O thin, it's Co'burn, sure! and that divvle Thayodor&#8212;a pretty 
 paper, sir, but light&#8212;thrashy, milk-and-wathery&#8212;not sthrong, like 
 the Litherary Chran&#8212;good luck to it.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, Doctor Lander, I was going to tell at once the name of the 
 periodical, it's FRASER'S MAGAZINE.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;FRESER!&quot; says the Doctor.  &quot;O thunder and turf!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;FWASER!&quot; says Bullwig.  &quot;O&#8212;ah&#8212;hum&#8212;haw&#8212;yes&#8212;no&#8212;why,&#8212;that is 
 weally&#8212;no, weally, upon my weputation, I never before heard the  name 
of the pewiodical.  By the by, Sir John, what wemarkable good  clawet 
this is; is it Lawose or Laff&#8212;?&quot; </P>
<P> Laff, indeed! he cooden git beyond laff; and I'm blest if I could 
 kip it neither,&#8212;for hearing him pretend ignurnts, and being behind 
 the skreend, settlin somethink for the genlmn, I bust into such a  raw 
of laffing as never was igseeded. </P>
<P> &quot;Hullo!&quot; says Bullwig, turning red.  &quot;Have I said anything 
 impwobable, aw widiculous? for, weally, I never befaw wecollect to 
 have heard in society such a twemendous peal of cachinnation&#8212;that 
 which the twagic bard who fought at Mawathon has called an  anewithmon 
gelasma.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, be the holy piper,&quot; says Larder, &quot;I think you are dthrawing a 
 little on your imagination.  Not read Fraser!  Don't believe him,  my 
lord duke; he reads every word of it, the rogue!  The boys about  that 
magazine baste him as if he was a sack of oatmale.  My reason  for 
crying out, Sir Jan, was because you mintioned Fraser at all.  Bullwig 
has every syllable of it be heart&#8212;from the pailitix down  to the 
'Yellowplush Correspondence.'&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Ha, ha!&quot; says Bullwig, affecting to laff (you may be sure my ears 
 prickt up when I heard the name of the &quot;Yellowplush Correspondence&quot;). 
 &quot;Ha, ha! why, to tell truth, I HAVE wead the cowespondence to which 
 you allude: it's a gweat favowite at court. I was talking with  Spwing 
Wice and John Wussell about it the other day.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Well, and what do you think of it?&quot; says Sir John, looking mity 
 waggish&#8212;for he knew it was me who roat it. </P>
<P> &quot;Why, weally and twuly, there's considewable cleverness about the 
 cweature; but it's low, disgustingly low: it violates pwabability, 
 and the orthogwaphy is so carefully inaccuwate, that it requires a 
 positive study to compwehend it.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, faith,&quot; says Larner; &quot;the arthagraphy is detestible; it's as 
 bad for a man to write bad spillin as it is for 'em to speak wid a 
 brrogue.  Iducation furst, and ganius afterwards.  Your health, my 
 lord, and good luck to you.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yaw wemark,&quot; says Bullwig, &quot;is vewy appwopwiate.  You will 
 wecollect, Sir John, in Hewodotus (as for you, Doctor, you know  more 
about Iwish than about Gweek),&#8212;you will wecollect, without  doubt, a 
stowy nawwated by that cwedulous though fascinating  chwonicler, of a 
certain kind of sheep which is known only in a  certain distwict of 
Awabia, and of which the tail is so enormous,  that it either dwaggles 
on the gwound, or is bound up by the  shepherds of the country into a 
small wheelbawwow, or cart, which  makes the chwonicler sneewingly 
wemark that thus 'the sheep of  Awabia have their own chawiots.'  I 
have often thought, sir (this  clawet is weally nectaweous)&#8212;I have 
often, I say, thought that the  wace of man may be compawed to these 
Awabian sheep&#8212;genius is our  tail, education our wheelbawwow.  Without 
art and education to pwop  it, this genius dwops on the gwound, and is 
polluted by the mud, or  injured by the wocks upon the way: with the 
wheelbawwow it is  stwengthened, incweased, and supported&#8212;a pwide to 
the owner, a  blessing to mankind.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;A very appropriate simile,&quot; says Sir John; &quot;and I am afraid that 
 the genius of our friend Yellowplush has need of some such support.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Apropos,&quot; said Bullwig, &quot;who IS Yellowplush?  I was given to 
 understand that the name was only a fictitious one, and that the 
 papers were written by the author of the 'Diary of a Physician;' if 
 so, the man has wonderfully improved in style, and there is some  hope 
of him.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Bah!&quot; says the Duke of Doublejowl; &quot;everybody knows it's Barnard, 
 the celebrated author of 'Sam Slick.'&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Pardon, my dear duke,&quot; says Lord Bagwig; &quot;it's the authoress of 
 'High Life,' 'Almack's,' and other fashionable novels.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Fiddlestick's end!&quot; says Doctor Larner; &quot;don't be blushing and 
 pretinding to ask questions; don't we know you, Bullwig?  It's you 
 yourself, you thief of the world: we smoked you from the very 
 beginning.&quot; </P>
<P> Bullwig was about indignantly to reply, when Sir John interrupted 
 them, and said,&#8212;&quot;I must correct you all, gentlemen; Mr. Yellowplush 
 is no other than Mr. Yellowplush: he gave you, my dear Bullwig, your 
 last glass of champagne at dinner, and is now an inmate of my house, 
 and an ornament of my kitchen!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Gad!&quot; says Doublejowl, &quot;let's have him up.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Hear, hear!&quot; says Bagwig. </P>
<P> &quot;Ah, now,&quot; says Larner, &quot;your grace is not going to call up and 
 talk to a footman, sure?  Is it gintale?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;To say the least of it,&quot; says Bullwig, &quot;the pwactice is iwwegular, 
 and indecowous; and I weally don't see how the interview can be in 
 any way pwofitable.&quot; </P>
<P> But the vices of the company went against the two littery men, and 
 everybody excep them was for having up poor me.  The bell was  wrung; 
butler came.  &quot;Send up Charles,&quot; says master; and Charles,  who was 
standing behind the skreand, was persnly abliged to come  in. </P>
<P> &quot;Charles,&quot; says master, &quot;I have been telling these gentlemen who 
 is the author of the 'Yellowplush Correspondence' in Fraser's 
 Magazine.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It's the best magazine in Europe,&quot; says the duke. </P>
<P> &quot;And no mistake,&quot; says my lord. </P>
<P> &quot;Hwhat!&quot; says Larner; &quot;and where's the Litherary Chran?&quot; </P>
<P> I said myself nothink, but made a bough, and blusht like pickle- 
 cabbitch. </P>
<P> &quot;Mr. Yellowplush,&quot; says his grace, &quot;will you, in the first place, 
 drink a glass of wine?&quot; </P>
<P> I boughed agin. </P>
<P> &quot;And what wine do you prefer, sir? humble port or imperial 
burgundy?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why, your grace,&quot; says I, &quot;I know my place, and ain't above 
 kitchin wines.  I will take a glass of port, and drink it to the 
 health of this honrabble compny.&quot; </P>
<P> When I'd swigged off the bumper, which his grace himself did me the 
 honor to pour out for me, there was a silints for a minnit; when my 
 master said:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;Charles Yellowplush, I have perused your memoirs in Fraser's 
 Magazine with so much curiosity, and have so high an opinion of  your 
talents as a writer, that I really cannot keep you as a  footman any 
longer, or allow you to discharge duties for which you  are now quite 
unfit.  With all my admiration for your talents, Mr.  Yellowplush, I 
still am confident that many of your friends in the  servants'-hall 
will clean my boots a great deal better than a  gentleman of your 
genius can ever be expected to do&#8212;it is for this  purpose I employ 
footmen, and not that they may be writing articles  in magazines. 
 But&#8212;you need not look so red, my good fellow, and  had better take 
another glass of port&#8212;I don't wish to throw you  upon the wide world 
without the means of a livelihood, and have  made interest for a little 
place which you will have under  government, and which will give you an 
income of eighty pounds per  annum; which you can double, I presume, by 
your literary labors.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Sir,&quot; says I, clasping my hands, and busting into tears, &quot;do not&#8212; 
 for heaven's sake, do not!&#8212;think of any such think, or drive me  from 
your suvvice, because I have been fool enough to write in  magaseens. 
 Glans but one moment at your honor's plate&#8212;every spoon  is as bright 
as a mirror; condysend to igsamine your shoes&#8212;your  honor may see 
reflected in them the fases of every one in the  company.  I blacked 
them shoes, I cleaned that there plate.  If  occasionally I've forgot 
the footman in the litterary man, and  committed to paper my 
remindicences of fashnabble life, it was from  a sincere desire to do 
good, and promote nollitch: and I appeal to  your honor,&#8212;I lay my hand 
on my busm, and in the fase of this  noble company beg you to say, When 
you rung your bell, who came to  you fust?  When you stopt out at 
Brooke's till morning, who sat up  for you?  When you was ill, who 
forgot the natral dignities of his  station, and answered the two-pair 
bell?  Oh, sir,&quot; says I, &quot;I know  what's what; don't send me away.  I 
know them littery chaps, and,  beleave me, I'd rather be a footman. 
 The work's not so hard&#8212;the  pay is better: the vittels incompyrably 
supearor.  I have but to  clean my things, and run my errints, and you 
put clothes on my  back, and meat in my mouth.  Sir! Mr. Bullwig! an't 
I right? shall  I quit MY station and sink&#8212;that is to say, rise&#8212;to 
YOURS?&quot; </P>
<P> Bullwig was violently affected; a tear stood in his glistening i. 
 &quot;Yellowplush,&quot; says he, seizing my hand, &quot;you ARE right.  Quit not 
 your present occupation; black boots, clean knives, wear plush, all 
 your life, but don't turn literary man.  Look at me.  I am the  first 
novelist in Europe.  I have ranged with eagle wing over the  wide 
regions of literature, and perched on every eminence in its  turn.  I 
have gazed with eagle eyes on the sun of philosophy, and  fathomed the 
mysterious depths of the human mind.  All languages  are familiar to 
me, all thoughts are known to me, all men  understood by me.  I have 
gathered wisdom from the honeyed lips of  Plato, as we wandered in the 
gardens of Acadames&#8212;wisdom, too, from  the mouth of Job Johnson, as we 
smoked our 'backy in Seven Dials.  Such must be the studies, and such 
is the mission, in this world,  of the Poet-Philosopher.  But the 
knowledge is only emptiness; the  initiation is but misery; the 
initiated, a man shunned and bann'd  by his fellows.  Oh,&quot; said 
Bullwig, clasping his hands, and  throwing his fine i's up to the 
chandelier, &quot;the curse of  Pwometheus descends upon his wace.  Wath and 
punishment pursue them  from genewation to genewation!  Wo to genius, 
the heaven-scaler,  the fire-stealer!  Wo and thrice bitter desolation! 
 Earth is the  wock on which Zeus, wemorseless, stwetches his withing 
victim&#8212;men,  the vultures that feed and fatten on him.  Ai, ai! it is 
agony  eternal&#8212;gwoaning and solitawy despair!  And you, Yellowplush, 
 would penetwate these mystewies: you would waise the awful veil,  and 
stand in the twemendous Pwesence.  Beware; as you value your  peace, 
beware!  Withdwaw, wash Neophyte!  For heaven's sake&#8212;O for  heaven's 
sake!&#8212;&quot; here he looked round with agony&#8212;give me a glass  of 
bwandy-and-water, for this clawet is beginning to disagwee with  me.&quot; </P>
<P> Bullwig having concluded this spitch, very much to his own 
 sattasfackshn, looked round to the compny for aplaws, and then 
 swigged off the glass of brandy-and-water, giving a sollum sigh as  he 
took the last gulph; and then Doctor Ignatius, who longed for a  chans, 
and, in order to show his independence, began flatly  contradicting his 
friend, addressed me, and the rest of the genlmn  present, in the 
following manner:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;Hark ye,&quot; says he, &quot;my gossoon, doan't be led asthray by the 
 nonsinse of that divil of a Bullwig.  He's jillous of ye, my bhoy: 
 that's the rale, undoubted thruth; and it's only to keep you out of 
 litherary life that he's palavering you in this way.  I'll tell you 
 what&#8212;Plush ye blackguard,&#8212;my honorable frind the mimber there has 
 told me a hunder times by the smallest computation, of his intense 
 admiration of your talents, and the wonderful sthir they were  making 
in the world.  He can't bear a rival.  He's mad with envy,  hatred, 
oncharatableness.  Look at him, Plush, and look at me.  My  father was 
not a juke exactly, nor aven a markis, and see,  nevertheliss, to what 
a pitch I am come.  I spare no ixpinse; I'm  the iditor of a cople of 
pariodicals; I dthrive about in me  carridge: I dine wid the lords of 
the land; and why&#8212;in the name of  the piper that pleed before Mosus, 
hwy?  Because I'm a litherary  man.  Because I know how to play me 
cards.  Because I'm Docther  Larner, in fact, and mimber of every 
society in and out of Europe.  I might have remained all my life in 
Thrinity Colledge, and never  made such an incom as that offered you by 
Sir Jan; but I came to  London&#8212;to London, my boy, and now see!  Look 
again at me friend  Bullwig.  He IS a gentleman, to be sure, and bad 
luck to 'im, say  I; and what has been the result of his litherary 
labor?  I'll tell  you what; and I'll tell this gintale society, by the 
shade of Saint  Patrick, they're going to make him a BARINET.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;A BARNET, Doctor!&quot; says I; &quot;you don't mean to say they're going to 
 make him a barnet!&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;As sure as I've made meself a docthor,&quot; says Larner. </P>
<P> &quot;What, a baronet, like Sir John?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;The divle a bit else.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;And pray what for?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What faw?&quot; says Bullwig.  &quot;Ask the histowy of litwatuwe what faw? 
 Ask Colburn, ask Bentley, ask Saunders and Otley, ask the gweat 
 Bwitish nation, what faw?  The blood in my veins comes puwified 
 thwough ten thousand years of chivalwous ancestwy; but that is 
 neither here nor there: my political principles&#8212;the equal wights 
 which I have advocated&#8212;the gweat cause of fweedom that I have 
 celebwated, are known to all.  But this, I confess, has nothing to  do 
with the question.  No, the question is this&#8212;on the thwone of 
 litewature I stand unwivalled, pwe-eminent; and the Bwitish 
 government, honowing genius in me, compliments the Bwitish nation  by 
lifting into the bosom of the heweditawy nobility, the most  gifted 
member of the democwacy.&quot;  (The honrabble genlm here sunk  down amidst 
repeated cheers.) </P>
<P> &quot;Sir John,&quot; says I, &quot;and my lord duke, the words of my rivrint 
 frend Ignatius, and the remarks of the honrabble genlmn who has  just 
sate down, have made me change the detummination which I had  the honor 
of igspressing just now. </P>
<P> &quot;I igsept the eighty pound a year; knowing that I shall ave plenty 
 of time for pursuing my littery career, and hoping some day to set  on 
that same bentch of barranites, which is deckarated by the  presnts of 
my honrabble friend. </P>
<P> &quot;Why shooden I?  It's trew I ain't done anythink as YET to deserve 
 such an honor; and it's very probable that I never shall.  But what 
 then?&#8212;quaw dong, as our friends say?  I'd much rayther have a 
 coat-of-arms than a coat of livry.  I'd much rayther have my blud- 
 red hand spralink in the middle of a shield, than underneath a tea- 
 tray.  A barranit I will be; and, in consiquints, must cease to be  a 
footmin. </P>
<P> &quot;As to my politticle princepills, these, I confess, ain't settled: 
 they are, I know, necessary; but they ain't necessary UNTIL ASKT  FOR; 
besides, I reglar read the Sattarist newspaper, and so  ignirince on 
this pint would be inigscusable. </P>
<P> &quot;But if one man can git to be a doctor, and another a barranit, and 
 another a capting in the navy, and another a countess, and another 
 the wife of a governor of the Cape of Good Hope, I begin to  perseave 
that the littery trade ain't such a very bad un;  igspecially if you're 
up to snough, and know what's o'clock.  I'll  learn to make myself 
usefle, in the fust place; then I'll larn to  spell; and, I trust, by 
reading the novvles of the honrabble  member, and the scientafick 
treatiseses of the reverend doctor, I  may find the secrit of suxess, 
and git a litell for my own share.  I've sevral frends in the press, 
having paid for many of those  chaps' drink, and given them other 
treets; and so I think I've got  all the emilents of suxess; therefore, 
I am detummined, as I said,  to igsept your kind offer, and beg to 
withdraw the wuds which I  made yous of when I refyoused your 
hoxpatable offer.  I must,  however&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I wish you'd withdraw yourself,&quot; said Sir John, bursting into a 
 most igstrorinary rage, &quot;and not interrupt the company with your 
 infernal talk!  Go down, and get us coffee: and, hark ye! hold your 
 impertinent tongue, or I'll break every bone in your body.  You  shall 
have the place as I said; and while you're in my service, you  shall be 
my servant; but you don't stay in my service after to-  morrow.  Go 
down stairs, sir; and don't stand staring here!&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> In this abrupt way, my evening ended; it's with a melancholy regret 
 that I think what came of it.  I don't wear plush any more.  I am  an 
altered, a wiser, and, I trust, a better man. </P>
<P> I'm about a novvle (having made great progriss in spelling), in the 
 style of my friend Bullwig; and preparing for publigation, in the 
 Doctor's Cyclopedear, &quot;The Lives of Eminent British and Foring 
 Wosherwomen.&quot; </P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_4">SKIMMINGS FROM &quot;THE DAIRY OF GEORGE 
IV.&quot;</A></H2>
<P> CHARLES YELLOWPLUSH, ESQ, TO OLIVER YORKE, ESQ.* </P>
<P> DEAR WHY,&#8212;Takin advantage of the Crismiss holydays, Sir John and 
 me (who is a member of parlyment) had gone down to our place in 
 Yorkshire for six wicks, to shoot grows and woodcox, and enjoy old 
 English hospitalaty.  This ugly Canady bisniss unluckaly put an end 
 to our sports in the country, and brot us up to Buckly Square as  fast 
as four posterses could gallip.  When there, I found your  parcel, 
containing the two vollumes of a new book; which, as I have  been away 
from the literary world, and emplied solely in athlatic  exorcises, 
have been laying neglected in my pantry, among my knife-  cloaths, and 
dekanters, and blacking-bottles, and bed-room candles,  and things. </P>
<P> * These Memoirs were originally published in Fraser's Magazine, and 
 it may be stated for the benefit of the unlearned in such matters, 
 that &quot;Oliver Yorke&quot; is the assumed name of the editor of that 
 periodical. </P>
<P> This will, I'm sure, account for my delay in notussing the work.  I 
see sefral of the papers and magazeens have been befoarhand with  me, 
and have given their apinions concerning it: specially the  Quotly 
Revew, which has most mussilessly cut to peases the author  of this 
Dairy of the Times of George IV.* </P>
<P> * Diary illustrative of the Times of George the Fourth, 
 interspersed with Original Letters from the late Queen Caroline,  and 
from various other distinguished Persons. </P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
         &quot;Tot ou tard, tout se scait.&quot;&#8212;MAINTENON.</PRE>
<P> In 2 vols.  London, 1838.  Henry Colburn. </P>
<P> That it's a woman who wrote it is evydent from the style of the 
 writing, as well as from certain proofs in the book itself.  Most 
 suttnly a femail wrote this Dairy; but who this Dairy-maid may be,  I, 
in coarse, can't conjecter: and indeed, common galliantry  forbids me 
to ask.  I can only judge of the book itself; which, it  appears to me, 
is clearly trenching upon my ground and favrite  subjicks, viz. 
fashnabble life, as igsibited in the houses of the  nobility, gentry, 
and rile fammly. </P>
<P> But I bare no mallis&#8212;infamation is infamation, and it doesn't 
 matter where the infamy comes from; and whether the Dairy be from 
 that distinguished pen to which it is ornarily attributed&#8212;whether,  I 
say, it comes from a lady of honor to the late quean, or a  scullion to 
that diffunct majisty, no matter: all we ask is  nollidge; never mind 
how we have it.  Nollidge, as our cook says,  is like 
trikel-possit&#8212;it's always good, though you was to drink it  out of an 
old shoo. </P>
<P> Well, then, although this Dairy is likely searusly to injur my 
 pussonal intrests, by fourstalling a deal of what I had to say in  my 
private memoars&#8212;though many, many guineas, is taken from my  pockit, 
by cuttin short the tail of my narratif&#8212;though much that I  had to say 
in souperior languidge, greased with all the ellygance  of my orytory, 
the benefick of my classcle reading, the chawms of  my agreble wit, is 
thus abruply brot befor the world by an inferior  genus, neither 
knowing nor writing English; yet I say, that  nevertheless I must say, 
what I am puffickly prepaired to say, to  gainsay which no man can say 
a word&#8212;yet I say, that I say I  consider this publication welkom.  Far 
from viewing it with enfy, I  greet it with applaws; because it 
increases that most exlent  specious of nollidge, I mean &quot;FASHNABBLE 
NOLLIDGE:&quot; compayred to  witch all other nollidge is nonsince&#8212;a bag of 
goold to a pare of  snuffers. </P>
<P> Could Lord Broom, on the Canady question, say moar? or say what he 
 had tu say better?  We are marters, both of us, to prinsple; and 
 every body who knows eather knows that we would sacrafice anythink 
 rather than that.  Fashion is the goddiss I adoar.  This delightful 
 work is an offring on her srine; and as sich all her wushippers are 
 bound to hail it.  Here is not a question of trumpry lords and 
 honrabbles, generals and barronites, but the crown itself, and the 
 king and queen's actions; witch may be considered as the crown 
 jewels.  Here's princes, and grand-dukes and airsparent, and heaven 
 knows what; all with blood-royal in their veins, and their names 
 mentioned in the very fust page of the peeridge.  In this book you 
 become so intmate with the Prince of Wales, that you may follow  him, 
if you please, to his marridge-bed: or, if you prefer the  Princiss 
Charlotte, you may have with her an hour's tator-tator.* </P>
<P> * Our estimable correspondent means, we presume, tete-a-tete.&#8212;O. 
Y. </P>
<P> Now, though most of the remarkable extrax from this book have been 
 given already (the cream of the Dairy, as I wittily say,) I shall 
 trouble you, nevertheless, with a few; partly because they can't be 
 repeated too often, and because the toan of obsyvation with which 
 they have been genrally received by the press, is not igsackly such 
 as I think they merit.  How, indeed, can these common magaseen and 
 newspaper pipple know anythink of fashnabble life, let alone ryal? </P>
<P> Conseaving, then, that the publication of the Dairy has done reel 
 good on this scoar, and may probly do a deal moor, I shall look 
 through it, for the porpus of selecting the most ellygant passidges, 
 and which I think may be peculiarly adapted to the reader's benefick. </P>
<P> For you see, my dear Mr. Yorke, that in the fust place, that this 
 is no common catchpny book, like that of most authors and 
 authoresses, who write for the base looker of gain.  Heaven bless 
 you! the Dairy-maid is above anything musnary.  She is a woman of 
 rank, and no mistake; and is as much above doin a common or vulgar 
 action as I am superaor to taking beer after dinner with my cheese. 
 She proves that most satisfackarily, as we see in the following 
 passidge:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;Her royal highness came to me, and having spoken a few phrases on 
 different subjects, produced all the papers she wishes to have 
 published: her whole correspondence with the prince relative to  Lady 
J&#8212;-'s dismissal; his subsequent neglect of the princess; and, 
 finally, the acquittal of her supposed guilt, signed by the Duke of 
 Portland, at the time of the secret inquiry: when, if proof  could 
have been brought against her, it certainly would have been  done; and 
which acquittal, to the disgrace of all parties concerned,  as well as 
to the justice of the nation in general, was not made  public at the 
time.  A common criminal is publicly condemned or  acquitted.  Her 
royal highness commanded me to have these letters  published forthwith, 
saying, 'You may sell them for a great sum.'  At first (for she had 
spoken to me before concerning this business),  I thought of availing 
myself of the opportunity; but upon second  thoughts, I turned from 
this idea with detestation: for, if I do  wrong by obeying her wishes 
and endeavoring to serve her, I will do  so at least from good and 
disinterested motives, not from any sordid  views.  The princess 
commands me, and I will obey her, whatever may  be the issue; but not 
for fare or fee.  I own I tremble, not so much  for myself, as for the 
idea that she is not taking the best and most  dignified way of having 
these papers published.  Why make a secret  of it at all?  If wrong, it 
should not be done; if right it should  be done openly, and in the face 
of her enemies.  In her royal  highness's case, as in that of wronged 
princes in general, why do  they shrink from straightforward dealings, 
and rather have recourse  to crooked policy?  I wish, in this 
particular instance, I could  make her royal highness feel thus: but 
she is naturally indignant at  being falsely accused, and will not 
condescend to an avowed  explanation.&quot; </P>
<P> Can anythink be more just and honrabble than this?  The Dairy-lady 
 is quite fair and abovebored.  A clear stage, says she, and no 
 favior!  &quot;I won't do behind my back what I am ashamed of before my 
 face: not I!&quot;  No more she does; for you see that, though she was 
 offered this manyscrip by the princess FOR NOTHINK, though she knew 
 that she could actially get for it a large sum of money, she was 
 above it, like an honest, noble, grateful, fashnabble woman, as she 
 was.  She aboars secrecy, and never will have recors to disguise or 
 crookid polacy.  This ought to be an ansure to them RADICLE  SNEERERS, 
who pretend that they are the equals of fashnabble  pepple; wheras it's 
a well-known fact, that the vulgar roagues have  no notion of honor. </P>
<P> And after this positif declaration, which reflex honor on her 
 ladyship (long life to her! I've often waited behind her chair!)&#8212; 
 after this positif declaration, that, even for the porpus of 
 DEFENDING her missis, she was so hi-minded as to refuse anythink  like 
a peculiarly consideration, it is actially asserted in the  public 
prints by a booxeller, that he has given her A THOUSAND  POUND for the 
Dairy.  A thousand pound! nonsince!&#8212;it's a phigment!  a base lible! 
 This woman take a thousand pound, in a matter where  her dear 
mistriss, friend, and benyfactriss was concerned!  Never!  A thousand 
baggonits would be more prefrabble to a woman of her  xqizzit feelins 
and fashion. </P>
<P> But to proseed.  It's been objected to me, when I wrote some of my 
 expearunces in fashnabble life, that my languidge was occasionally 
 vulgar, and not such as is genrally used in those exqizzit famlies 
 which I frequent.  Now, I'll lay a wager that there is in this  book, 
wrote as all the world knows, by a rele lady, and speakin of  kings and 
queens as if they were as common as sand-boys&#8212;there is  in this book 
more wulgarity than ever I displayed, more nastiness  than ever I would 
dare TO THINK ON, and more bad grammar than ever  I wrote since I was a 
boy at school.  As for authografy, evry  genlmn has his own: never mind 
spellin, I say, so long as the sence  is right. </P>
<P> Let me here quot a letter from a corryspondent of this charming 
 lady of honor; and a very nice corryspondent he is, too, without  any 
mistake: </P>
<P> &quot;Lady O&#8212;-, poor Lady O&#8212;-! knows the rules of prudence, I fear me, 
 as imperfectly as she doth those of the Greek and Latin Grammars:  or 
she hath let her brother, who is a sad swine, become master of  her 
secrets, and then contrived to quarrel with him.  You would see  the 
outline of the melange in the newspapers; but not the report  that Mr. 
S&#8212;- is about to publish a pamphlet, as an addition to the  Harleian 
Tracts, setting forth the amatory adventures of his  sister.  We shall 
break our necks in haste to buy it, of course  crying 'Shameful' all 
the while; and it is said that Lady O&#8212;- is  to be cut, which I cannot 
entirely believe.  Let her tell two or  three old women about town that 
they are young and handsome, and  give some well-timed parties, and she 
may still keep the society  which she hath been used to.  The times are 
not so hard as they  once were, when a woman could not construe Magna 
Charta with  anything like impunity.  People were full as gallant many 
years  ago.  But the days are gone by wherein my lord-protector of the 
 commonwealth of England was wont to go a lovemaking to Mrs. 
 Fleetwood, with the Bible under his arm. </P>
<P> &quot;And so Miss Jacky Gordon is really clothed with a husband at last, 
 and Miss Laura Manners left without a mate!  She and Lord Stair 
 should marry and have children in mere revenge.  As to Miss Gordon, 
 she's a Venus well suited for such a Vulcan,&#8212;whom nothing but  money 
and a title could have rendered tolerable, even to a kitchen  wench. 
 It is said that the matrimonial correspondence between this  couple is 
to be published, full of sad scandalous relations, of  which you may be 
sure scarcely a word is true.  In former times,  the Duchess of St. 
A&#8212;-s made use of these elegant epistles in  order to intimidate Lady 
Johnstone: but that ruse would not avail;  so in spite, they are to be 
printed.  What a cargo of amiable  creatures!  Yet will some people 
scarcely believe in the existence  of Pandemonium. </P>
<P> &quot;Tuesday Morning.&#8212;You are perfectly right respecting the hot rooms 
 here, which we all cry out against, and all find very comfortable&#8212; 
 much more so than the cold sands and bleak neighborhood of the sea; 
 which looks vastly well in one of Vander Velde's pictures hung upon 
 crimson damask, but hideous and shocking in reality.  H&#8212;- and his 
 'elle' (talking of parties) were last night at Cholmondeley House, 
 but seem not to ripen in their love.  He is certainly good-humored, 
 and I believe, good-hearted, so deserves a good wife; but his cara 
 seems a genuine London miss made up of many affectations.  Will she 
 form a comfortable helpmate?  For me, I like not her origin, and  deem 
many strange things to run in blood, besides madness and the 
 Hanoverian evil. </P>
<P> &quot;Thursday.&#8212;I verily do believe that I shall never get to the end 
 of this small sheet of paper, so many unheard of interruptions have  I 
had; and now I have been to Vauxhall, and caught the toothache.  I was 
of Lady E. B&#8212;-m and H&#8212;-'s party: very dull&#8212;the Lady giving  us all a 
supper after our promenade&#8212; </P>

 The thing will not do.  In the meantime, Miss Long hath  become quite 
cruel to Wellesley Pole, and divides her favor equally  between Lords 
Killeen and Kilworth, two as simple Irishmen as ever  gave birth to a

<P> A disgusting pictur of human nature, indeed&#8212;and isn't he who 
 moralizes about it, and she to whom he writes, a couple of pretty 
 heads in the same piece?  Which, Mr. Yorke, is the wust, the  scandle

 Fust, he scrapes togither all the bad stoaries about all  the people 
of his acquentance&#8212;he goes to a ball, and laffs or  snears at 
everybody there&#8212;he is asked to a dinner, and brings  away, along with 
meat and wine to his heart's content, a sour  stomick filled with nasty 
stories of all the people present there.  He has such a squeamish 
appytite, that all the world seems to  DISAGREE with him.  And what has 
he got to say to his delicate  female frend?  Why that&#8212; </P>

<P> Nex.  That Miss Gordon is going to be cloathed with an usband; and 
 that all their matrimonial corryspondins is to be published too. </P>
<P> 3.  That Lord H. is going to be married; but there's some thing 
 rong in his wife's blood. </P>
<P> 4.  Miss Long has cut Mr. Wellesley, and is gone after two Irish 
 lords. </P>
<P> Wooden you phancy, now, that the author of such a letter, instead 
 of writin about pipple of tip-top qualaty, was describin Vinegar 
 Yard?  Would you beleave that the lady he was a-ritin to was a 
 chased, modist lady of honor, and mother of a famly?  O trumpery!  O 
morris! as Homer says: this is a higeous pictur of manners, such  as I 
weap to think of, as evry morl man must weap. </P>
<P> The above is one pritty pictur of mearly fashnabble life: what 
 follows is about families even higher situated than the most 
 fashnabble.  Here we have the princessregient, her daughter the 
 Princess Sharlot, her grandmamma the old quean, and her madjisty's 
 daughters the two princesses.  If this is not high life, I don't  know 
where it is to be found; and it's pleasing to see what  affeckshn and 
harmny rains in such an exolted spear. </P>
<P> &quot;Sunday 24th.&#8212;Yesterday, the princess went to meet the Princess 
 Charlotte at Kensington.  Lady &#8212;&#8212; told me that, when the latter 
 arrived, she rushed up to her mother, and said, 'For God's sake, be 
 civil to her,' meaning the Duchess of Leeds, who followed her.  Lady 
&#8212;&#8212; said she felt sorry for the latter; but when the Princess  of 
Wales talked to her, she soon became so free and easy, that one  could 
not have any FEELING about her FEELINGS.  Princess Charlotte,  I was 
told, was looking handsome, very pale, but her head more  becomingly 
dressed,&#8212;that is to say, less dressed than usual.  Her  figure is of 
that full round shape which is now in its prime; but  she disfigures 
herself by wearing her bodice so short, that she  literally has no 
waist.  Her feet are very pretty; and so are her  hands and arms, and 
her ears, and the shape of her head.  Her  countenance is expressive, 
when she allows her passions to play  upon it; and I never saw any 
face, with so little shade, express so  many powerful and varied 
emotions.  Lady &#8212;&#8212; told me that the  Princess Charlotte talked to her 
about her situation, and said, in  a very quiet, but determined way, 
she WOULD NOT BEAR IT, and that  as soon as parliament met, she 
intended to come to Warwick House,  and remain there; that she was also 
determined not to consider the  Duchess of Leeds as her GOVERNESS but 
only as her FIRST LADY.  She  made many observations on other persons 
and subjects; and appears  to be very quick, very penetrating, but 
imperious and wilful.  There is a tone of romance, too, in her 
character, which will only  serve to mislead her. </P>
<P> &quot;She told her mother that there had been a great battle at Windsor 
 between the queen and the prince, the former refusing to give up  Miss 
Knight from her own person to attend on Princess Charlotte as 
 sub-governess.  But the prince-regent had gone to Windsor himself, 
 and insisted on her doing so; and the 'old Beguin' was forced to 
 submit, but has been ill ever since: and Sir Henry Halford declared 
 it was a complete breaking up of her constitution&#8212;to the great 
 delight of the two princesses, who were talking about this affair. 
 Miss Knight was the very person they wished to have; they think  they 
can do as they like with her.  It has been ordered that the  Princess 
Charlotte should not see her mother alone for a single  moment; but the 
latter went into her room, stuffed a pair of large  shoes full of 
papers, and having given them to her daughter, she  went home.  Lady 
&#8212;&#8212; told me everything was written down and sent  to Mr. Brougham NEXT 
DAY.&quot; </P>
<P> See what discord will creap even into the best regulated famlies. 
 Here are six of 'em&#8212;viz., the quean and her two daughters, her  son, 
and his wife and daughter; and the manner in which they hate  one 
another is a compleat puzzle. </P>

<P> The old quean, by their squobbles, is on the pint of death; and her 
 two jewtiful daughters are delighted at the news.  What a happy, 
 fashnabble, Christian famly!  O Mr. Yorke, Mr. Yorke, if this is  the 
way in the drawin-rooms, I'm quite content to live below, in  pease and 
charaty with all men; writin, as I am now, in my pantry,  or els havin 
a quiet game at cards in the servants-all.  With US  there's no bitter, 
wicked, quarling of this sort.  WE don't hate  our children, or bully 
our mothers, or wish 'em ded when they're  sick, as this Dairywoman 
says kings and queens do.  When we're  writing to our friends or 
sweethearts, WE don't fill our letters  with nasty stoaries, takin away 
the carricter of our fellow-  servants, as this maid of honor's amusin' 
moral frend does.  But,  in coarse, it's not for us to judge of our 
betters;&#8212;these great  people are a supeerur race, and we can't 
comprehend their ways. </P>
<P> Do you recklect&#8212;it's twenty years ago now&#8212;how a bewtiffle 
 princess died in givin buth to a poar baby, and how the whole  nation 
of Hengland wep, as though it was one man, over that sweet  woman and 
child, in which were sentered the hopes of every one of  us, and of 
which each was as proud as of his own wife or infnt?  Do  you recklect 
how pore fellows spent their last shillin to buy a  black crape for 
their hats, and clergymen cried in the pulpit, and  the whole country 
through was no better than a great dismal  funeral?  Do you recklet, 
Mr. Yorke, who was the person that we all  took on so about?  We called 
her the Princis Sharlot of Wales; and  we valyoud a single drop of her 
blood more than the whole heartless  body of her father.  Well, we 
looked up to her as a kind of saint  or angle, and blest God (such 
foolish loyal English pipple as we  ware in those days) who had sent 
this sweet lady to rule over us.  But heaven bless you! it was only 
souperstition.  She was no better  than she should be, as it turns 
out&#8212;or at least the Dairy-maid  says so.  No better?&#8212;if my daughters 
or yours was 1/2 so bad, we'd  as leaf be dead ourselves, and they 
hanged.  But listen to this  pritty charritable story, and a truce to 
reflexshuns:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;Sunday, January, 9, 1814.&#8212;Yesterday, according to appointment, I 
 went to Princess Charlotte.  Found at Warwick House the harp-  player, 
Dizzi; was asked to remain and listen to his performance,  but was 
talked to during the whole time, which completely prevented  all 
possibility of listening to the music.  The Duchess of Leeds  and her 
daughter were in the room, but left it soon.  Next arrived  Miss 
Knight, who remained all the time I was there.  Princess  Charlotte was 
very gracious&#8212;showed me all her bonny dyes, as B&#8212;-  would have called 
them&#8212;pictures, and cases, and jewels,  She  talked in a very desultory 
way, and it would be difficult to say of  what.  She observed her 
mother was in very low spirits.  I asked  her how she supposed she 
could be otherwise?  This QUESTIONING  answer saves a great deal of 
trouble, and serves two purposes&#8212;i.e.  avoids committing oneself, or 
giving offence by silence.  There was  hung in the apartment one 
portrait, amongst others, that very much  resembled the Duke of D&#8212;-. 
 I asked Miss Knight whom it represented.  She said that was not known; 
it had been supposed a likeness of the  Pretender, when young.  This 
answer suited my thoughts so comically  I could have laughed, if one 
ever did at courts anything but the  contrary of what one was inclined 
to do. </P>
<P> &quot;Princess Charlotte has a very great variety of expression in her 
 countenance&#8212;a play of features, and a force of muscle, rarely seen 
 in connection with such soft and shadeless coloring.  Her hands and 
 arms are beautiful; but I think her figure is already gone, and  will 
soon be precisely like her mother's: in short it is the very  picture 
of her, and NOT IN MINIATURE.  I could not help analyzing  my own 
sensations during the time I was with her, and thought more  of them 
than I did of her.  Why was I at all flattered, at all more  amused, at 
all more supple to this young princess, than to her who  is only the 
same sort of person set in the shade of circumstances  and of years? 
 It is that youth, and the approach of power, and the  latent views of 
self-interest, sway the heart and dazzle the  understanding.  If this 
is so with a heart not, I trust, corrupt,  and a head not particularly 
formed for interested calculations,  what effect must not the same 
causes produce on the generality of  mankind? </P>
<P> &quot;In the course of the conversation, the Princess Charlotte 
contrived  to edge in a good deal of tum-de-dy, and would, if I had 
entered  into the thing, have gone on with it, while looking at a 
little  picture of herself, which had about thirty or forty different 
 dresses to put over it, done on isinglass, and which allowed the 
 general coloring of the picture to be seen through its transparency. 
 It was, I thought, a pretty enough conceit, though rather like 
 dressing up a doll.  'Ah!,' said Miss Knight, 'I am not content 
 though, madame&#8212;for I yet should have liked one more dress&#8212;that of 
 the favorite Sultana.' </P>
<P> &quot;'No, no!' said the princess, 'I never was a favorite, and never 
 can be one,'&#8212;looking at a picture which she said was her father's, 
 but which I do not believe was done for the regent any more than  for 
me, but represented a young man in a hussar's dress&#8212;probably a  former 
favorite. </P>
<P> &quot;The Princess Charlotte seemed much hurt at the little notice that 
 was taken of her birthday.  After keeping me for two hours and a  half 
she dismissed me; and I am sure I could not say what she said,  except 
that it was an olio of decousus and heterogeneous things,  partaking of 
the characteristics of her mother, grafted on a  younger scion.  I 
dined tete-a-tete with my dear old aunt: hers is  always a sweet and 
soothing society to me.&quot; </P>
<P> There's a pleasing, lady-like, moral extract for you!  An innocent 
 young thing of fifteen has picturs of TWO lovers in her room, and 
 expex a good number more.  This dellygate young creature EDGES in a 
 good deal of TUMDEDY (I can't find it in Johnson's Dixonary), and 
 would have GONE ON WITH THE THING (ellygence of languidge), if the 
 dairy-lady would have let her. </P>
<P> Now, to tell you the truth, Mr. Yorke, I doan't beleave a single 
 syllible of this story.  This lady of honner says, in the fust  place, 
that the princess would have talked a good deal of TUMDEDY:  which 
means, I suppose, indeasnsy, if she, the lady of honner WOULD  HAVE LET 
HER.  This IS a good one!  Why, she lets every body else  talk tumdedy 
to their hearts' content; she lets her friends WRITE  tumdedy, and, 
after keeping it for a quarter of a sentry, she  PRINTS it.  Why then, 
be so squeamish about HEARING a little!  And,  then, there's the stoary 
of the two portricks.  This woman has the  honner to be received in the 
frendlyest manner by a British  princess; and what does the grateful 
loyal creature do?  2 picturs  of the princess's relations are hanging 
in her room, and the Dairy-  woman swears away the poor young 
princess's carrickter, by swearing  they are picturs of her LOVERS. 
 For shame, oh, for shame! you  slanderin backbitin dairy-woman you! 
 If you told all them things  to your &quot;dear old aunt,&quot; on going to dine 
with her, you must have  had very &quot;sweet and soothing society&quot; indeed. </P>
<P> I had marked out many more extrax, which I intended to write about; 
 but I think I have said enough about this Dairy: in fack, the  butler, 
and the gals in the servants'-hall are not well pleased  that I should 
go on reading this naughty book; so we'll have no  more of it, only one 
passidge about Pollytics, witch is sertnly  quite new:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;No one was so likely to be able to defeat Bonaparte as the Crown 
 Prince, from the intimate knowledge he possessed of his character. 
 Bernadotte was also instigated against Bonaparte by one who not  only 
owed him a personal hatred, but who possessed a mind equal to  his, and 
who gave the Crown Prince both information and advice how  to act. 
 This was no less a person than Madame de Stael.  It was  not, as some 
have asserted, THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH BERNADOTTE;  for, at the time 
of their intimacy, MADAME DE STAEL WAS IN LOVE  WITH ROCCA.  But she 
used her influence (which was not small) with  the Crown Prince, to 
make him fight against Bonaparte, and to her  wisdom may be attributed 
much of the success which accompanied his  attack upon him.  Bernadotte 
has raised the flame of liberty, which  seems fortunately to blaze all 
around.  May it liberate Europe; and  from the ashes of the laurel may 
olive branches spring up, and  overshadow the earth!&quot; </P>
<P> There's a discuvery! that the overthrow of Boneypart is owing to 
 MADAME DE STAEL!  What nonsince for Colonel Southey or Doctor  Napier 
to write histories of the war with that Capsican hupstart  and 
murderer, when here we have the whole affair explaned by the  lady of 
honor! </P>
<P> &quot;Sunday, April 10, 1814.&#8212;The incidents which take place every hour 
 are miraculous.  Bonaparte is deposed, but alive; subdued, but 
 allowed to choose his place of residence.  The island of Elba is  the 
spot he has selected for his ignominious retreat.  France is  holding 
forth repentant arms to her banished sovereign.  The  Poissardes who 
dragged Louis XVI. to the scaffold are presenting  flowers to the 
Emperor of Russia, the restorer of their legitimate  king!  What a 
stupendous field for philosophy to expatiate in!  What an endless 
material for thought!  What humiliation to the  pride of mere human 
greatness!  How are the mighty fallen!  Of all  that was great in 
Napoleon, what remains?  Despoiled of his usurped  power, he sinks to 
insignificance.  There was no moral greatness in  the man.  The meteor 
dazzled, scorched, is put out,&#8212;utterly, and  for ever.  But the power 
which rests in those who have delivered  the nations from bondage, is a 
power that is delegated to them from  heaven; and the manner in which 
they have used it is a guarantee  for its continuance.  The Duke of 
Wellington has gained laurels  unstained by any useless flow of blood. 
 He has done more than  conquer others&#8212;he has conquered himself: and 
in the midst of the  blaze and flush of victory, surrounded by the 
homage of nations, he  has not been betrayed into the commission of any 
act of cruelty or  wanton offence.  He was as cool and self-possessed 
under the blaze  and dazzle of fame as a common man would be under the 
shade of his  garden-tree, or by the hearth of his home.  But the 
tyrant who kept  Europe in awe is now a pitiable object for scorn to 
point the  finger of derision at: and humanity shudders as it remembers 
the  scourge with which this man's ambition was permitted to devastate 
 every home tie, and every heartfelt joy.&quot; </P>
<P> And now, after this sublime passidge, as full of awfle reflections 
 and pious sentyments as those of Mrs. Cole in the play, I shall  only 
quot one little extrak more:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;All goes gloomily with the poor princess.  Lady Charlotte Campbell 
 told me she regrets not seeing all these curious personages; but  she 
says, the more the princess is forsaken, the more happy she is  at 
having offered to attend her at this time.  THIS IS VERY AMIABLE  IN 
HER, and cannot fail to be gratifying to the princess.&quot; </P>
<P> So it is&#8212;wery amiable, wery kind and considerate in her, indeed. 
 Poor Princess! how lucky you was to find a frend who loved you for 
 your own sake, and when all the rest of the wuld turned its back  kep 
steady to you.  As for believing that Lady Sharlot had any hand  in 
this book,* heaven forbid! she is all gratitude, pure gratitude, 
 depend upon it.  SHE would not go for to blacken her old frend and 
 patron's carrickter, after having been so outrageously faithful to 
 her; SHE wouldn't do it, at no price, depend upon it.  How sorry  she 
must be that others an't quite so squemish, and show up in this 
 indesent way the follies of her kind, genrus, foolish bennyfactris! </P>
<P> * The &quot;authorized&quot; announcement, in the John Bull newspaper, sets 
 this question at rest.  It is declared that her ladyship is not the 
 writer of the Diary.&#8212;O. Y. </P>

 settn in the gallery, and sung out to him (he was in the pit), to 
 jine us after the play, over a glass of bear and a cold hoyster, in 
 my pantry, the family being out. </P>
<P> Smith came as appinted.  We descorsed on the subjick of the comady; 
 and, after sefral glases, we each of us agreed to write a letter to

<P> MAYFAIR, Nov. 30, 1839.  Midnite. </P>
<P> HONRABBLE BARNET!&#8212;Retired from the littery world a year or moar, I 
 didn't think anythink would injuice me to come forrards again: for  I 
was content with my share of reputation, and propoas'd to add  nothink 
to those immortial wux which have rendered this Magaseen so 
 sallybrated. </P>
<P> Shall I tell you the reazn of my re-appearants?&#8212;a desire for the 
 benefick of my fellow-creatures?  Fiddlestick!  A mighty truth with 
 which my busm labored, and which I must bring forth or die? 
 Nonsince&#8212;stuff: money's the secret, my dear Barnet,&#8212;money&#8212; 
 l'argong, gelt, spicunia.  Here's quarter-day coming, and I'm blest 
 if I can pay my landlud, unless I can ad hartificially to my inkum. </P>
<P> This is, however, betwigst you and me.  There's no need to blacard 
 the streets with it, or to tell the British public that Fitzroy 
 Y-ll-wpl-sh is short of money, or that the sallybrated hauthor of  the 
Y&#8212;- Papers is in peskewniary difficklties, or is fiteagued by  his 
superhuman littery labors, or by his famly suckmstansies, or by  any 
other pusnal matter: my maxim, dear B, is on these pints to be  as 
quiet as posbile.  What the juice does the public care for you or  me? 
 Why must we always, in prefizzes and what not, be a-talking  about 
ourselves and our igstrodnary merrats, woas, and injaries? It  is on 
this subjick that I porpies, my dear Barnet, to speak to you  in a 
frendly way; and praps you'll find my advise tolrabbly holesum. </P>
<P> Well, then,&#8212;if you care about the apinions, fur good or evil, of 
 us poor suvvants, I tell you, in the most candied way, I like you, 
 Barnet.  I've had my fling at you in my day (for, entry nou, that 
 last stoary I roat about you and Larnder was as big a bownsir as  ever 
was)&#8212;I've had my fling at you; but I like you.  One may  objeck to an 
immense deal of your writings, which, betwigst you and  me, contain 
more sham scentiment, sham morallaty, sham poatry, than  you'd like to 
own; but, in spite of this, there's the STUFF in you:  you've a kind 
and loyal heart in you, Barnet&#8212;a trifle deboshed,  perhaps; a kean i, 
igspecially for what's comic (as for your  tradgady, it's mighty 
flatchulent), and a ready plesnt pen.  The  man who says you are an As 
is an As himself.  Don't believe him,  Barnet! not that I suppose you 
wil,&#8212;for, if I've formed a correck  apinion of you from your wucks, 
you think your small-beear as good  as most men's: every man does,&#8212;and 
why not?  We brew, and we love  our own tap&#8212;amen; but the pint 
betwigst us, is this stewpid,  absudd way of crying out, because the 
public don't like it too.  Why shood they, my dear Barnet?  You may vow 
that they are fools;  or that the critix are your enemies; or that the 
wuld should judge  your poams by your critticle rules, and not their 
own: you may beat  your breast, and vow you are a marter, and you won't 
mend the  matter.  Take heart, man! you're not so misrabble after all: 
your  spirits need not be so VERY cast down; you are not so VERY badly 
 paid.  I'd lay a wager that you make, with one thing or another&#8212; 
 plays, novvles, pamphlicks, and little odd jobbs here and there&#8212; 
 your three thowsnd a year.  There's many a man, dear Bullwig that 
 works for less, and lives content.  Why shouldn't you?  Three  thowsnd 
a year is no such bad thing,&#8212;let alone the barnetcy: it  must be a 
great comfort to have that bloody hand in your skitching. </P>
<P> But don't you sea, that in a wuld naturally envius, wickid, and 
 fond of a joak, this very barnetcy, these very cumplaints,&#8212;this 
 ceaseless groning, and moning, and wining of yours, is igsackly the 
 thing which makes people laff and snear more?  If you were ever at  a 
great school, you must recklect who was the boy most bullid, and 
 buffited, and purshewd&#8212;he who minded it most.  He who could take a 
 basting got but few; he who rord and wep because the knotty boys 
 called him nicknames, was nicknamed wuss and wuss.  I recklect  there 
was at our school, in Smithfield, a chap of this milksop,  spoony sort, 
who appeared among the romping, ragged fellers in a  fine flanning 
dressing-gownd, that his mama had given him.  That  pore boy was beaten 
in a way that his dear ma and aunts didn't know  him; his fine flanning 
dressing-gownd was torn all to ribbings, and  he got no pease in the 
school ever after, but was abliged to be  taken to some other saminary, 
where, I make no doubt, he was paid  off igsactly in the same way. </P>
<P> Do you take the halligory, my dear Barnet?  Mutayto nominy&#8212;you 
 know what I mean.  You are the boy, and your barnetcy is the 
 dressing-gownd.  You dress yourself out finer than other chaps and 
 they all begin to sault and hustle you; it's human nature, Barnet. 
 You show weakness, think of your dear ma, mayhap, and begin to cry: 
 it's all over with you; the whole school is at you&#8212;upper boys and 
 under, big and little; the dirtiest little fag in the place will  pipe 
out blaggerd names at you, and takes his pewny tug at your  tail. </P>
<P> The only way to avoid such consperracies is to put a pair of stowt 
 shoalders forrards, and bust through the crowd of raggymuffins.  A 
 good bold fellow dubls his fistt, and cries, &quot;Wha dares meddle wi' 
 me?&quot;  When Scott got HIS barnetcy, for instans, did any one of us  cry 
out?  No, by the laws, he was our master; and wo betide the  chap that 
said neigh to him!  But there's barnets and barnets.  Do  you recklect 
that fine chapter in &quot;Squintin Durward,&quot; about the too  fellos and 
cups, at the siege of the bishop's castle?  One of them  was a brave 
warner, and kep HIS cup; they strangled the other chap&#8212;  strangled 
him, and laffed at him too. </P>
<P> With respeck, then, to the barnetcy pint, this is my advice: brazen 
 it out.  Us littery men I take to be like a pack of schoolboys&#8212; 
 childish, greedy, envius, holding by our friends, and always ready  to 
fight.  What must be a man's conduck among such?  He must either  take 
no notis, and pass on myjastick, or else turn round and pummle 
 soundly&#8212;one, two, right and left, ding dong over the face and  eyes; 
above all, never acknowledge that he is hurt.  Years ago, for  instans 
(we've no ill-blood, but only mention this by way of  igsample), you 
began a sparring with this Magaseen.  Law bless you,  such a ridicklus 
gaym I never see: a man so belaybord, beflustered,  bewolloped, was 
never known; it was the laff of the whole town.  Your intelackshal 
natur, respected Barnet, is not fizzickly  adapted, so to speak, for 
encounters of this sort.  You must not  indulge in combats with us 
course bullies of the press: you have  not the STAMINY for a reglar 
set-to.  What, then, is your plan?  In  the midst of the mob to pass as 
quiet as you can: you won't be  undistubbed.  Who is?  Some stray kix 
and buffits will fall to you&#8212;  mortial man is subjick to such; but if 
you begin to wins and cry  out, and set up for a marter, wo betide you! </P>
<P> These remarks, pusnal as I confess them to be, are yet, I assure 
 you, written in perfick good-natur, and have been inspired by your 
 play of the &quot;Sea Capting,&quot; and prefiz to it; which latter is on 
 matters intirely pusnal, and will, therefore, I trust, igscuse this 
 kind of ad hominam (as they say) disk-cushion.  I propose, honrabble 
 Barnit, to cumsider calmly this play and prephiz, and to speak of 
 both with that honisty which, in the pantry or studdy, I've been 
 always phamous for.  Let us, in the first place, listen to the 
 opening of the &quot;Preface of the Fourth Edition:&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No one can be more sensible than I am of the many faults and 
 deficiencies to be found in this play; but, perhaps, when it is 
 considered how very rarely it has happened in the history of our 
 dramatic literature that good acting plays have been produced,  except 
by those who have either been actors themselves, or formed  their 
habits of literature, almost of life, behind the scenes, I  might have 
looked for a criticism more generous, and less exacting  and rigorous, 
than that by which the attempts of an author  accustomed to another 
class of composition have been received by a  large proportion of the 
periodical press. </P>
<P> &quot;It is scarcely possible, indeed, that this play should not contain 
 faults of two kinds, first, the faults of one who has necessarily 
 much to learn in the mechanism of his art; and, secondly, of one  who, 
having written largely in the narrative style of fiction, may  not 
unfrequently mistake the effects of a novel for the effects of  a 
drama.  I may add to these, perhaps, the deficiencies that arise  from 
uncertain health and broken spirits, which render the author  more 
susceptible than he might have been some years since to that  spirit of 
depreciation and hostility which it has been his  misfortune to excite 
amongst the general contributors to the  periodical press for the 
consciousness that every endeavor will be  made to cavil, to distort, 
to misrepresent, and, in fine, if  possible, to RUN DOWN, will 
occasionally haunt even the hours of  composition, to check the 
inspiration, and damp the ardor. </P>
<P> &quot;Having confessed thus much frankly and fairly, and with a hope 
 that I may ultimately do better, should I continue to write for the 
 stage (which nothing but an assurance that, with all my defects, I 
 may yet bring some little aid to the drama, at a time when any aid, 
 however humble, ought to be welcome to the lovers of the art, could 
 induce me to do), may I be permitted to say a few words as to some  of 
the objections which have been made against this play?&quot; </P>
<P> Now, my dear sir, look what a pretty number of please you put 
 forrards here, why your play shouldn't be good. </P>
<P> First.  Good plays are almost always written by actors. </P>
<P> Secknd.  You are a novice to the style of composition. </P>
<P> Third.  You MAY be mistaken in your effects, being a novelist by 
 trade, and not a play-writer. </P>
<P> Fourthly.  Your in such bad helth and sperrits. </P>
<P> Fifthly.  Your so afraid of the critix, that they damp your arder. </P>
<P> For shame, for shame, man!  What confeshns is these,&#8212;what painful 
 pewling and piping!  Your not a babby.  I take you to be some seven 
 or eight and thutty years old&#8212;&quot;in the morning of youth,&quot; as the 
 flosofer says.  Don't let any such nonsince take your reazn  prisoner. 
 What, you, an old hand amongst us,&#8212;an old soljer of our  sovring 
quean the press,&#8212;you, who have had the best pay, have held  the 
topmost rank (ay, and DESERVED them too!&#8212;I gif you lef to quot  me in 
sasiaty, and say, &quot;I AM a man of genius: Y-ll-wpl-sh says  so&quot;),&#8212;you 
to lose heart, and cry pickavy, and begin to howl,  because little boys 
fling stones at you!  Fie, man! take courage;  and, bearing the terrows 
of your blood-red hand, as the poet says,  punish us, if we've ofended 
you: punish us like a man, or bear your  own punishment like a man. 
 Don't try to come off with such  misrabble lodgic as that above. </P>
<P> What do you?  You give four satisfackary reazns that the play is 
 bad (the secknd is naught,&#8212;for your no such chicking at play- 
 writing, this being the forth).  You show that the play must be  bad, 
and THEN begin to deal with the critix for finding folt! </P>
<P> Was there ever wuss generalship?  The play IS bad,&#8212;your right&#8212;a 
 wuss I never see or read.  But why kneed YOU say so?  If it was so 
 VERY bad, why publish it?  BECAUSE YOU WISH TO SERVE THE DRAMA!  O 
fie! don't lay that flattering function to your sole, as Milton 
 observes.  Do you believe that this &quot;Sea Capting&quot; can serve the 
 drama?  Did you never intend that it should serve anything, or 
 anybody ELSE?  Of cors you did!  You wrote it for money,&#8212;money  from 
the maniger, money from the bookseller,&#8212;for the same reason  that I 
write this.  Sir, Shakspeare wrote for the very same  reasons, and I 
never heard that he bragged about serving the drama.  Away with this 
canting about great motifs!  Let us not be too  prowd, my dear Barnet, 
and fansy ourselves marters of the truth,  marters or apostels.  We are 
but tradesmen, working for bread, and  not for righteousness' sake. 
 Let's try and work honestly; but  don't let us be prayting pompisly 
about our &quot;sacred calling.&quot;  The  taylor who makes your coats (and very 
well they are made too, with  the best of velvit collars)&#8212;I say 
Stulze, or Nugee, might cry out  that THEIR motifs were but to assert 
the eturnle truth of  tayloring, with just as much reazn; and who would 
believe them? </P>
<P> Well; after this acknollitchmint that the play is bad, come sefral 
 pages of attack on the critix, and the folt those gentry have found 
 with it.  With these I shan't middle for the presnt.  You defend  all 
the characters 1 by 1, and conclude your remarks as follows:&#8212; </P>
<P> &quot;I must be pardoned for this disquisition on my own designs.  When 
 every means is employed to misrepresent, it becomes, perhaps, 
 allowable to explain.  And if I do not think that my faults as a 
 dramatic author are to be found in the study and delineation of 
 character, it is precisely because THAT is the point on which all  my 
previous pursuits in literature and actual life would be most  likely 
to preserve me from the errors I own elsewhere, whether of  misjudgment 
or inexperience. </P>
<P> &quot;I have now only to add my thanks to the actors for the zeal and 
 talent with which they have embodied the characters entrusted to 
 them.  The sweetness and grace with which Miss Faucit embellished  the 
part of Violet, which, though only a sketch, is most necessary  to the 
coloring and harmony of the play, were perhaps the more  pleasing to 
the audience from the generosity, rare with actors,  which induced her 
to take a part so far inferior to her powers.  The applause which 
attends the performance of Mrs. Warner and Mr.  Strickland attests 
their success in characters of unusual  difficulty; while the singular 
beauty and nobleness, whether of  conception or execution, with which 
the greatest of living actors  has elevated the part of Norman (so 
totally different from his  ordinary range of character), is a new 
proof of his versatility and  accomplishment in all that belongs to his 
art.  It would be  scarcely gracious to conclude these remarks without 
expressing my  acknowledgment of that generous and indulgent sense of 
justice  which, forgetting all political differences in a literary 
arena,  has enabled me to appeal to approving audiences&#8212;from hostile 
 critics.  And it is this which alone encourages me to hope that, 
 sooner or later, I may add to the dramatic literature of my country 
 something that may find, perhaps, almost as many friends in the  next 
age as it has been the fate of the author to find enemies in  this.&quot; </P>
<P> See, now, what a good comfrabble vanaty is!  Pepple have quarld 
 with the dramatic characters of your play.  &quot;No,&quot; says you; &quot;if I  AM 
remarkabble for anythink, it's for my study and delineation of 
 character; THAT is presizely the pint to which my littery purshuits 
 have led me.&quot;  Have you read &quot;Jil Blaw,&quot; my dear sir?  Have you 
 pirouzed that exlent tragady, the &quot;Critic?&quot;  There's something so 
 like this in Sir Fretful Plaguy, and the Archbishop of Granadiers, 
 that I'm blest if I can't laff till my sides ake.  Think of the 
 critix fixing on the very pint for which you are famus!&#8212;the roags! 
 And spose they had said the plot was absudd, or the langwitch 
 absudder still, don't you think you would have had a word in defens 
 of them too&#8212;you who hope to find frends for your dramatic wux in  the 
nex age?  Poo!  I tell thee, Barnet, that the nex age will be  wiser 
and better than this; and do you think that it will imply  itself a 
reading of your trajadies?  This is misantrofy, Barnet&#8212;  reglar 
Byronism; and you ot to have a better apinian of human  natur. </P>
<P> Your apinion about the actors I shan't here meddle with.  They all 
 acted exlently as far as my humbile judgement goes, and your write  in 
giving them all possible prays.  But let's consider the last  sentence 
of the prefiz, my dear Barnet, and see what a pretty set  of apiniuns 
you lay down. </P>
<P> 1.  The critix are your inymies in this age. </P>
<P> 2.  In the nex, however, you hope to find newmrous frends. </P>
<P> 3.  And it's a satisfackshn to think that, in spite of politticle 
 diffrances, you have found frendly aujences here. </P>
<P> Now, my dear Barnet, for a man who begins so humbly with what my 
 friend Father Prout calls an argamantum ad misericorjam, who 
 ignowledges that his play is bad, that his pore dear helth is bad, 
 and those cussid critix have played the juice with him&#8212;I say, for  a 
man who beginns in such a humbill toan, it's rather RICH to see  how 
you end. </P>
<P> My dear Barnet, DO you suppose that POLITTICLE DIFFRANCES prejudice 
 pepple against YOU?  What ARE your politix?  Wig, I presume&#8212;so are 
 mine, ontry noo.  And what if they ARE Wig, or Raddiccle, or 
 Cumsuvvative?  Does any mortial man in England care a phig for your 
 politix?  Do you think yourself such a mity man in parlymint, that 
 critix are to be angry with you, and aujences to be cumsidered 
 magnanamous because they treat you fairly?  There, now, was  Sherridn, 
he who roat the &quot;Rifles&quot; and &quot;School for Scandle&quot; (I saw  the &quot;Rifles&quot; 
after your play, and, O Barnet, if you KNEW what a  relief it 
was!)&#8212;there, I say, was Sherridn&#8212;he WAS a politticle  character, if 
you please&#8212;he COULD make a spitch or two&#8212;do you  spose that Pitt, 
Purseyvall, Castlerag, old George the Third  himself, wooden go to see 
the &quot;Rivles&quot;&#8212;ay, and clap hands too, and  laff and ror, for all 
Sherry's Wiggery?  Do you spose the critix  wouldn't applaud too?  For 
shame, Barnet! what ninnis, what  hartless raskles, you must beleave 
them to be,&#8212;in the fust plase,  to fancy that you are a politticle 
genus; in the secknd, to let  your politix interfear with their notiums 
about littery merits! </P>
<P> &quot;Put that nonsince out of your head,&quot; as Fox said to Bonypart. 
 Wasn't it that great genus, Dennis, that wrote in Swiff and Poop's 
 time, who fansid that the French king wooden make pease unless  Dennis 
was delivered up to him?  Upon my wud, I doan't think he  carrid his 
diddlusion much further than a serting honrabble barnet  of my 
aquentance. </P>
<P> And then for the nex age.  Respected sir, this is another 
 diddlusion; a gross misteak on your part, or my name is not Y&#8212;sh. 
 These plays immortial?  Ah, parrysampe, as the French say, this is 
 too strong&#8212;the small-beer of the &quot;Sea Capting,&quot; or of any suxessor 
 of the &quot;Sea Capting,&quot; to keep sweet for sentries and sentries! 
 Barnet, Barnet! do you know the natur of bear?  Six weeks is not 
 past, and here your last casque is sour&#8212;the public won't even now 
 drink it; and I lay a wager that, betwigst this day (the thuttieth 
 November) and the end of the year, the barl will be off the stox 
 altogether, never, never to return. </P>
<P> I've notted down a few frazes here and there, which you will do 
 well do igsamin:&#8212; </P>

<B> NORMAN.</B>
 
   &quot;The eternal Flora
    Woos to her odorous haunts the western wind;
    While circling round and upwards from the boughs,
    Golden with fruits that lure the joyous birds,
    Melody, like a happy soul released,
    Hangs in the air, and from invisible plumes
    Shakes sweetness down!&quot;
 
 
<B> NORMAN.</B>
 
   &quot;And these the lips
    Where, till this hour, the sad and holy kiss
    Of parting linger'd, as the fragrance left
    By ANGELS when they touch the earth and vanish.&quot;
 
 
<B> NORMAN.</B>
 
   &quot;Hark! she has blessed her son!  I bid ye witness,
    Ye listening heavens&#8212;thou circumambient air:
    The ocean sighs it back&#8212;and with the murmur
    Rustle the happy leaves.  All nature breathes
    Aloud&#8212;aloft&#8212;to the Great Parent's ear,
    The blessing of the mother on her child.&quot;
 
 
<B> NORMAN.</B>
 
   &quot;I dream of love, enduring faith, a heart
    Mingled with mine&#8212;a deathless heritage,
    Which I can take unsullied to the STARS,
    When the Great Father calls his children home.&quot;
 
 
<B> NORMAN.</B>
 
   &quot;The blue air, breathless in the STARRY peace,
    After long silence hushed as heaven, but filled
    With happy thoughts as heaven with ANGELS.&quot;

</PRE>
<P><B> NORMAN.</B> &quot;Till one calm night, when over earth and wave 
 Heaven looked its love from all its numberless STARS.&quot; </P>
<P><B> NORMAN.</B> &quot;Those eyes, the guiding STARS by which I steered.&quot; <B>

face  Is bright with gazing ever on the STARS&#8212;  The mother-sea.&quot; <B>
 NORMAN.</B> &quot;My bark shall be our home;  The STARS that light the 
ANGEL palaces  Of air, our lamps.&quot; <B> NORMAN.</B> &quot;A name that 
glitters, like a STAR, amidst  The galaxy of England's loftiest born.&quot; <B>
 LADY ARUNDEL.</B> &quot;And see him princeliest of the lion tribe,  Whose 
swords and coronals gleam around the throne,  The guardian STARS of the 
imperial isle.&quot; </P>
<P> The fust spissymen has been going the round of all the papers, as 
 real, reglar poatry.  Those wickid critix! they must have been 
 laffing in their sleafs when they quoted it.  Malody, suckling  round 
and uppards from the bows, like a happy soul released, hangs  in the 
air, and from invizable plumes shakes sweetness down.  Mighty fine, 
truly! but let mortial man tell the meannink of the  passidge.  Is it 
MUSICKLE sweetniss that Malody shakes down from  its plumes&#8212;its wings, 
that is, or tail&#8212;or some pekewliar scent  that proceeds from happy 
souls released, and which they shake down  from the trees when they are 
suckling round and uppards?  IS this  poatry, Barnet?  Lay your hand on 
your busm, and speak out boldly:  Is it poatry, or sheer windy humbugg, 
that sounds a little melojous,  and won't bear the commanest test of 
comman sence? </P>
<P> In passidge number 2, the same bisniss is going on, though in a 
 more comprehensable way: the air, the leaves, the otion, are fild 
 with emocean at Capting Norman's happiness.  Pore Nature is dragged 
 in to partisapate in his joys, just as she has been befor.  Once in  a 
poem, this universle simfithy is very well; but once is enuff, my  dear 
Barnet: and that once should be in some great suckmstans, 
 surely,&#8212;such as the meeting of Adam and Eve, in &quot;Paradice Lost,&quot;  or 
Jewpeter and Jewno, in Hoamer, where there seems, as it were, a  reasn 
for it.  But sea-captings should not be eternly spowting and  invoking 
gods, hevns, starrs, angels, and other silestial  influences.  We can 
all do it, Barnet; nothing in life is esier.  I  can compare my livry 
buttons to the stars, or the clouds of my  backopipe to the dark 
vollums that ishew from Mount Hetna; or I can  say that angels are 
looking down from them, and the tobacco silf,  like a happy sole 
released, is circling round and upwards, and  shaking sweetness down. 
 All this is as esy as drink; but it's not  poatry, Barnet, nor 
natural.  People, when their mothers reckonize  them, don't howl about 
the suckumambient air, and paws to think of  the happy leaves 
a-rustling&#8212;at least, one mistrusts them if they  do.  Take another 
instans out of your own play.  Capting Norman  (with his eternil 
SLACK-JAW!) meets the gal of his art:&#8212; </P>

 </PRE>
<P> Very right, Miss Violet&#8212;the scentiment is natral, affeckshnit, 
 pleasing, simple (it might have been in more grammaticle languidge, 
 and no harm done); but never mind, the feeling is pritty; and I can 
 fancy, my dear Barnet, a pritty, smiling, weeping lass, looking up  in 
a man's face and saying it.  But the capting!&#8212;oh, this  capting!&#8212;this 
windy, spouting captain, with his prittinesses, and  conseated 
apollogies for the hardness of his busm, and his old,  stale, vapid 
simalies, and his wishes to be a bee!  Pish!  Men  don't make love in 
this finniking way.  It's the part of a  sentymentle, poeticle taylor, 
not a galliant gentleman, in command  of one of her Madjisty's vessels 
of war. </P>
<P> Look at the remaining extrac, honored Barnet, and acknollidge that 
 Capting Norman is eturnly repeating himself, with his endless  jabber 
about stars and angels.  Look at the neat grammaticle twist  of Lady 
Arundel's spitch, too, who, in the corse of three lines,  has made her 
son a prince, a lion, with a sword and coronal, and a  star.  Why 
jumble and sheak up metafors in this way?  Barnet, one  simily is quite 
enuff in the best of sentenses (and I preshume I  kneedn't tell you 
that it's as well to have it LIKE, when you are  about it).  Take my 
advise, honrabble sir&#8212;listen to a humble  footmin: it's genrally best 
in poatry to understand puffickly  what you mean yourself, and to 
ingspress your meaning clearly  afterwoods&#8212;in the simpler words the 
better, praps.  You may, for  instans, call a coronet a coronal (an 
&quot;ancestral coronal,&quot; p. 74)  if you like, as you might call a hat a 
&quot;swart sombrero,&quot; &quot;a glossy  four-and-nine,&quot; &quot;a silken helm, to storm 
impermeable, and lightsome  as the breezy gossamer;&quot; but, in the long 
run, it's as well to call  it a hat.  It IS a hat; and that name is 
quite as poetticle as  another.  I think it's Playto, or els 
Harrystottle, who observes  that what we call a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet.  Confess, now, dear Barnet, don't you long to 
call it a Polyanthus? </P>

<P> To CH-RL-S F-TZR-Y PL-NT-G-N-T Y-LL-WPL-SH, ESQ.,  </P>
<P> 30th Nov. 1839. </P>
<P> MY DEAR AND HONORED SIR,&#8212;I have the pleasure of laying before you 
 the following description of the plot, and a few remarks upon the 
 style of the piece called &quot;The Sea Captain.&quot; </P>
<P> Five-and-twenty years back, a certain Lord Arundel had a daughter, 
 heiress of his estates and property; a poor cousin, Sir Maurice 
 Beevor (being next in succession); and a page, Arthur Le Mesnil by 
 name. </P>
<P> The daughter took a fancy for the page, and the young persons were 
 married unknown to his lordship. </P>
<P> Three days before her confinement (thinking, no doubt, that period 
 favorable for travelling), the young couple had agreed to run away 
 together, and had reached a chapel near on the sea-coast, from  which 
they were to embark, when Lord Arundel abruptly put a stop to  their 
proceedings by causing one Gaussen, a pirate, to murder the  page. </P>
<P> His daughter was carried back to Arundel House, and, in three days, 
 gave birth to a son.  Whether his lordship knew of this birth I 
 cannot say; the infant, however, was never acknowledged, but  carried 
by Sir Maurice Beevor to a priest, Onslow by name, who  educated the 
lad and kept him for twelve years in profound  ignorance of his birth. 
 The boy went by the name of Norman. </P>
<P> Lady Arundel meanwhile married again, again became a widow, but had 
 a second son, who was the acknowledged heir, and called Lord  Ashdale. 
 Old Lord Arundel died, and her ladyship became countess  in her own 
right. </P>
<P> When Norman was about twelve years of age, his mother, who wished 
 to &quot;WAFT young Arthur to a distant land,&quot; had him sent on board  ship. 
 Who should the captain of the ship be but Gaussen, who  received a 
smart bribe from Sir Maurice Beevor to kill the lad.  Accordingly, 
Gaussen tied him to a plank, and pitched him overboard. </P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> About thirteen years after these circumstances, Violet, an orphan 
 niece of Lady Arundel's second husband, came to pass a few weeks  with 
her ladyship.  She had just come from a sea-voyage, and had  been saved 
from a wicked Algerine by an English sea captain.  This  sea captain 
was no other than Norman, who had been picked up off  his plank, and 
fell in love with, and was loved by, Miss Violet. </P>
<P> A short time after Violet's arrival at her aunt's the captain came 
 to pay her a visit, his ship anchoring off the coast, near Lady 
 Arundel's residence.  By a singular coincidence, that rogue  Gaussen's 
ship anchored in the harbor too.  Gaussen at once knew  his man, for he 
had &quot;tracked&quot; him, (after drowning him,) and he  informed Sir Maurice 
Beevor that young Norman was alive. </P>
<P> Sir Maurice Beevor informed her ladyship.  How should she get rid 
 of him?  In this wise.  He was in love with Violet, let him marry  her 
and be off; for Lord Ashdale was in love with his cousin too;  and, of 
course, could not marry a young woman in her station of  life.  &quot;You 
have a chaplain on board,&quot; says her ladyship to Captain  Norman; &quot;let 
him attend to-night in the ruined chapel, marry  Violet, and away with 
you to sea.&quot;  By this means she hoped to be  quit of him forever. </P>
<P> But unfortunately the conversation had been overheard by Beevor, 
 and reported to Ashdale.  Ashdale determined to be at the chapel  and 
carry off Violet; as for Beevor, he sent Gaussen to the chapel  to kill 
both Ashdale and Norman; thus there would only be Lady  Arundel between 
him and the title. </P>
<P> Norman, in the meanwhile, who had been walking near the chapel, had 
 just seen his worthy old friend, the priest, most barbarously 
 murdered there.  Sir Maurice Beevor had set Gaussen upon him; his 
 reverence was coming with the papers concerning Norman's birth,  which 
Beevor wanted in order to extort money from the countess.  Gaussen was, 
however, obliged to run before he got the papers; and  the clergyman 
had time, before he died, to tell Norman the story,  and give him the 
documents, with which Norman sped off to the  castle to have an 
interview with his mother. </P>
<P> He lays his white cloak and hat on the table, and begs to be left 
 alone with her ladyship.  Lord Ashdale, who is in the room, surlily 
 quits it; but, going out, cunningly puts on Norman's cloak.  &quot;It  will 
be dark,&quot; says he, &quot;down at the chapel; Violet won't know me;  and, 
egad! I'll run off with her!&quot; </P>
<P> Norman has his interview.  Her ladyship acknowledges him, for she 
 cannot help it; but will not embrace him, love him, or have  anything 
to do with him. </P>
<P> Away he goes to the chapel.  His chaplain was there waiting to 
 marry him to Violet, his boat was there to carry him on board his 
 ship, and Violet was there, too. </P>
<P> &quot;Norman,&quot; says she, in the dark, &quot;dear Norman, I knew you by your 
 white cloak; here I am.&quot;  And she and the man in a cloak go off to 
 the inner chapel to be married. </P>
<P> There waits Master Gaussen; he has seized the chaplain and the 
 boat's crew, and is just about to murder the man in the cloak,  when&#8212; </P>
<P> NORMAN rushes in and cuts him down, much to the surprise of Miss, 
 for she never suspected it was sly Ashdale who had come, as we have 
 seen, disguised, and very nearly paid for his masquerading. </P>
<P> Ashdale is very grateful; but, when Norman persists in marrying 
 Violet, he says&#8212;no, he shan't.  He shall fight; he is a coward if  he 
doesn't fight.  Norman flings down his sword, and says he WON'T  fight; 
and&#8212; </P>
<P> Lady Arundel, who has been at prayers all this time, rushing in, 
 says, &quot;Hold! this is your brother, Percy&#8212;your elder brother!&quot;  Here 
is some restiveness on Ashdale's part, but he finishes by  embracing 
his brother. </P>
<P> Norman burns all the papers; vows he will never peach; reconciles 
 himself with his mother; says he will go loser; but, having ordered 
 his ship to &quot;veer&quot; round to the chapel, orders it to veer back  again, 
for he will pass the honeymoon at Arundel Castle. </P>
<P> As you have been pleased to ask my opinion, it strikes me that 
 there are one or two very good notions in this plot.  But the  author 
does not fail, as he would modestly have us believe, from  ignorance of 
stage-business; he seems to know too much, rather than  too little, 
about the stage; to be too anxious to cram in effects,  incidents, 
perplexities.  There is the perplexity concerning  Ashdale's murder, 
and Norman's murder, and the priest's murder, and  the page's murder, 
and Gaussen's murder.  There is the perplexity  about the papers, and 
that about the hat and cloak, (a silly,  foolish obstacle,) which only 
tantalize the spectator, and retard  the march of the drama's action: 
it is as if the author had said,  &quot;I must have a new incident in every 
act, I must keep tickling the  spectator perpetually, and never let him 
off until the fall of the  curtain.&quot; </P>
<P> The same disagreeable bustle and petty complication of intrigue you 
 may remark in the author's drama of &quot;Richelieu.&quot;  &quot;The Lady of  Lyons&quot; 
was a much simpler and better wrought plot; the incidents  following 
each other either not too swiftly or startlingly.  In  &quot;Richelieu,&quot; it 
always seemed to me as if one heard doors  perpetually clapping and 
banging; one was puzzled to follow the  train of conversation, in the 
midst of the perpetual small noises  that distracted one right and 
left. </P>
<P> Nor is the list of characters of &quot;The Sea Captain&quot; to be despised. 
 The outlines of all of them are good.  A mother, for whom one feels  a 
proper tragic mixture of hatred and pity; a gallant single-  hearted 
son, whom she disdains, and who conquers her at last by his  noble 
conduct; a dashing haughty Tybalt of a brother; a wicked poor  cousin, 
a pretty maid, and a fierce buccaneer.  These people might  pass three 
hours very well on the stage, and interest the audience  hugely; but 
the author fails in filling up the outlines.  His  language is absurdly 
stilted, frequently careless; the reader or  spectator hears a number 
of loud speeches, but scarce a dozen lines  that seem to belong of 
nature to the speakers. </P>
<P> Nothing can be more fulsome or loathsome to my mind than the 
 continual sham-religious clap-traps which the author has put into  the 
mouth of his hero; nothing more unsailor-like than his namby-  pamby 
starlit descriptions, which my ingenious colleague has, I  see, alluded 
to.  &quot;Thy faith my anchor, and thine eyes my haven,&quot;  cries the gallant 
captain to his lady.  See how loosely the  sentence is constructed, 
like a thousand others in the book.  The  captain is to cast anchor 
with the girl's faith in her own eyes;  either image might pass by 
itself, but together, like the  quadrupeds of Kilkenny, they devour 
each other.  The captain tells  his lieutenant to BID HIS BARK VEER 
ROUND to a point in the harbor.  Was ever such language?  My lady gives 
Sir Maurice a thousand  pounds to WAFT him (her son) to some distant 
shore.  Nonsense,  sheer nonsense; and what is worse, affected 
nonsense! </P>
<P> Look at the comedy of the poor cousin.  &quot;There is a great deal of 
 game on the estate&#8212;partridges, hares, wild-geese, snipes, and 
 plovers (SMACKING HIS LIPS)&#8212;besides a magnificent preserve of 
 sparrows, which I can sell TO THE LITTLE BLACKGUARDS in the streets 
 at a penny a hundred.  But I am very poor&#8212;a very poor old knight!&quot; </P>
<P> Is this wit or nature?  It is a kind of sham wit; it reads as if it 
 were wit, but it is not.  What poor, poor stuff, about the little 
 blackguard boys! what flimsy ecstasies and silly &quot;smacking of lips&quot; 
 about the plovers.  Is this the man who writes for the next age?  O 
fie!  Here is another joke:&#8212; </P>
<P></P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
       &quot;Sir Maurice.  Mice! zounds, how can I
   Keep mice!  I can't afford it!  They were starved
   To death an age ago.  The last was found
   Come Christmas three years, stretched beside a bone
   In that same larder, so consumed and worn
   By pious fast, 'twas awful to behold it!
   I canonized its corpse in spirits of wine,
   And set it in the porch&#8212;a solemn warning
   To thieves and beggars!&quot;
</PRE>
<P> Is not this rare wit?  &quot;Zounds! how can I keep mice?&quot; is well 
 enough for a miser; not too new, or brilliant either; but this 
 miserable dilution of a thin joke, this wretched hunting down of  the 
poor mouse!  It is humiliating to think of a man of esprit  harping so 
long on such a mean, pitiful string.  A man who aspires  to 
immortality, too!  I doubt whether it is to be gained thus;  whether 
our author's words are not too loosely built to make  &quot;starry pointing 
pyramids of.&quot;  Horace clipped and squared his  blocks more carefully 
before he laid the monument which imber edax,  or aquila impotens, or 
fuga temporum might assail in vain.  Even  old Ovid, when he raised his 
stately, shining heathen temple, had  placed some columns in it, and 
hewn out a statue or two which  deserved the immortality that he 
prophesied (somewhat arrogantly)  for himself.  But let not all be 
looking forward to a future, and  fancying that, &quot;incerti spatium dum 
finiat aevi,&quot; our books are to  be immortal.  Alas! the way to 
immortality is not so easy, nor will  our &quot;Sea Captain&quot; be permitted 
such an unconscionable cruise.  If  all the immortalities were really 
to have their wish, what a work  would our descendants have to study 
them all! </P>
<P> Not yet, in my humble opinion, has the honorable baronet achieved 
 this deathless consummation.  There will come a day (may it be long 
 distant!) when the very best of his novels will be forgotten; and  it 
is reasonable to suppose that his dramas will pass out of  existence, 
some time or other, in the lapse of the secula  seculorum.  In the 
meantime, my dear Plush, if you ask me what the  great obstacle is 
towards the dramatic fame and merit of our  friend, I would say that it 
does not lie so much in hostile critics  or feeble health, as in a 
careless habit of writing, and a peevish  vanity which causes him to 
shut his eyes to his faults.  The  question of original capacity I will 
not moot; one may think very  highly of the honorable baronet's talent, 
without rating it quite  so high as he seems disposed to do. </P>
<P> And to conclude: as he has chosen to combat the critics in person, 
 the critics are surely justified in being allowed to address him 
 directly. </P>
<PRE CLASS="poem">
      With best compliments to Mrs. Yellowplush,

<P> And now, Smith having finisht his letter, I think I can't do better 
 than clothes mine lickwise; for though I should never be tired of 
 talking, praps the public may of hearing, and therefore it's best  to 
shut up shopp. </P>
<P> What I've said, respected Barnit, I hoap you woan't take unkind.  A

 But don't fansy, I besitch you, that we are actiated  by hostillaty;
