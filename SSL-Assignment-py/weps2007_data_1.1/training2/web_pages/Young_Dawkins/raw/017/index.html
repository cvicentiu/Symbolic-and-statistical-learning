							<p>Greetings, Fellow '72's far and wide!<br>
								<br>
								Summer on the beautiful Dartmouth campus is winding down, and as I write this the first &#147;pea-green Freshmen&#148;  are arriving full of the same excitement and apprehension that we felt 36 years ago. 'Though the years march inexorably onward, at least a few things seem not to change!<br>
								<br>
								Since last we visited I've gotten some news of note about a few of our brothers. Let's begin with <b><font color="#006600">Young Dawkins</font></b>, feted this spring by Toastmasters International for outstanding service to the UNH Foundation. Young has been instrumental as the Foundation's president in setting all-time records for both single-year and consecutive-year fundraising totals. Kudos, my friend!<br>
								<br>
								Despite a rocky political road not of his making <b><font color="#006600">Charlie Schudson</font></b> is in high spirits and moving forward in his career to points yet unknown. He writes: &#147;So as of August 1, I expect to join the ranks of the unemployed. With that, I must confess, comes a feeling of relief and liberation&#133;my 29 years of public service (seven as prosecutor, twenty-two as judge) have been fulfilling, but very difficult and draining. More importantly, with my new-found unemployment comes a sense of excitement. To be fifty-four, &#147;tanned and ready&#148; for&#133;whatever, is quite delightful. I'm casting a wide net in and out of Wisconsin.&#148;  OK, men, let's rally: any takers out there?<br>
								<br>
								<b><font color="#006600">Greg Yadley</font></b> has just been named among the Legal Elite in the latest edition of Florida Trend magazine. The elite are among the top 1.6% lawyers in the state as ranked by their peers. Greg was one of only 26 so recognized in his field of financial transactions and banking. Mighty impressive, I would say&#133;and SO Dartmouth! Congrats!<br>
								<br>
								Greg shares that his son Sloan is a Business major at Tulane in New Orleans, and his daughter Lauren is beginning a PhD program in Counseling Psychology at UT-Austin. He says: &#147;so if I could only stay up late at night I'd have two good cities to party in!&#148; While in Austin helping Lauren to find an apartment he spent a great evening with <b><font color="#006600">Bill Pollack</font></b>. Greg tells me that &#147; &#147;Sunshine&#148; doesn't look any older than he did - and certainly is as fit - as when he was the Big Green quarterback.&#148;  OK, Bill, share your secret with your classmates&#133;&#133;starting with Greg!<br>
								<br>
								A few short weeks ago <b><font color="#006600">Shel Prentice</font></b> hosted a &#147;mini-mini reunion&#148; barbecue at the Tom Dent Cabin during Sophomore Parent's Weekend. Present among our brethren were <b><font color="#006600">Rob Sutcliffe</font></b>, <b><font color="#006600">Demitri Papadopoulos</font></b>, <b><font color="#006600">Don Quaid</font></b> and <b><font color="#006600">Dan Cooperman</font></b>. <b><font color="#006600">Joel Hyatt</font></b> and <b><font color="#006600">Mike Hufft</font></b> were also rumored to be in the vicinity but never found their way down the hill to the river. Shel tells me that he's talked with <b><font color="#006600">Dan Hergott</font></b> who recently was visited by <b><font color="#006600">Kirk Andrus</font></b> (now there's a pair to draw to!). They had a great time. <br>
								<br>
								In closing, gents, let me reinforce part of <b><font color="#006600">John Rockwell</font></b>'s most recent Newsletter. We need your input on the planning for our upcoming minis and our 35th so please get in touch with President Jon, Shel, me, John R. or anyone of our Executive Officers with your thoughts.<br>
								<br>
								Yours in Green always,<br>
