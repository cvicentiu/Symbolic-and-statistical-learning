<H2>From Duntroon to the Dardanelles:<BR>
A biography of Lt William Henry Dawkins</H2>
<H6>SABRETACHE - VOLUME XXXVII - Apr/Jun 1996- No.2 - pages</H6>
<P>Judith Ingle, From Duntroon to the Dardanelles: A biography of Lt William Henry Dawkins, Self-published, 36 Wilson Street, Curtin, ACT, 319 pages, $30 soft cover plus postage</P>
<P>The wages and waste of war are illustrated in this recent biography of a young man who trained for four years and survived but 19 days on the battlefield at Gallipoli. The material used in the telling of this young man, Royal Military College graduate, Lt William Dawkins, is as fascinating as the result is disappointing.</P>
<P>First, the book will fascinate many for the sheer diversity of its original material arranged basically into three book sections; his training in Australia, his training in Egypt, followed by his death and a number of appendices. All sections are well illustrated, particularly the photographs, ranging from early life as a three year old to a young pith-helmeted cadet wielding a pick in a trench-digging exercise at RMC Duntroon. Reproduced are his letters home from the Australians' training camp at Mena in Egypt which fairly drip with the detail of life and training of a young man on his first big adventure. And the consoling letters to his parents on his death, from a grateful King, his friend Kitty McDougall, fellow officers, friends and relatives reveal a society of yesteryear.</P>
<P>The author is to be complemented for assembling such an array of primary-source material but the writing of a truly memorable book eludes her. For here was someone unique: William Henry Dawkins, aged 21 years and 9 months, five feet four inches high, the top graduating cadet of the Royal Military College First Class of 1911 landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.</P>
<P>With the outbreak of war on 5 August 1914 Dawkins' training was cut short by four months, being discharged from RMC on 14 August 1914 and receiving his commission as a Special Graduate (for service in Expeditionary Force) on the same day. Much of the book (319 pages) describe his early days at Duntroon (pages 1 to 66)-which is well done-followed by a section (pages 67 to 154) consisting mostly of reproductions of letters home telling of his experiences as the Australians train in Egypt. His war service of nineteen days at Gallipoli is retold in barest detail between pages 155 to 164.</P>
<P>It is a shame that the meticulous narrative, and partly analytical style, featured in the book's early Duntroon section was not continued throughout. With little additional effort, using official sources, the letters of Dawkins' great mate, Mirams, and the memories of Sapper Morey, who was with 'Dawks' when he died, a memorable story might have a emerged, explaining the naming of Dawkins Point, which seems significant, and the unfolding drama of Dawkins' last 19 days. Hopefully others may feel motivated. And it will be interesting if those others adopt the technique used by Bill Gammage in his brilliant study of soldiers in the First World War, The Broken Years, based on the diaries and letters of Australians. And more recently that by Denis Winter, who used the style, albeit sparingly, to great effect in 25 April 1915.</P>
<P>I have some minor comments that might have improved the book. I would have preferred different treatment for the material provided in Appendix 2. Here the author presents reproductions of letters concerning the disposal and distribution of Dawkins' effects; his paybook, his medals and his stored effects to name just a few. Some comment on the actions, and inactions, of the officials involved might have made more interesting reading. And the background and reasons for the Gallipoli campaign could have been more fully, and better, explained. For they were the reasons that placed young Dawkins in harm's way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, Judith Ingle is to be commended for gathering much unpublished material-notes, letters and photographs-for inclusion in her biography of the young Australian army engineer. Like fellow reviewer, Hugh Collins, in Stand To, April/May 1996, From Duntroon To the Dardanelles, will take a place in the literature of Anzac history. In particular it is a new and rich source of history surrounding Australia's Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the training of army officers before the First World War. - Barry Clissold </P>
