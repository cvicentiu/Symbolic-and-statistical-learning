not hear the breakfast-bell, and when the sexton
came up to awaken him he rubbed his eyes
with such an expression of bewilderment that
Mr. Cameron could not forbear laughing.

<p>"You must have had queer dreams, Paul,"
said he.

<p>"Yes, Uncle Hugh," said Paul, laughing, "I
believe I have."

<p>"When you have collected your wits, which
at present seem absent on a wool-gathering
expedition, perhaps you will tell what you have
been dreaming about."

<p>"So I will," said Paul, "and perhaps you
can interpret it for me.  I dreamed that I was
back again at Mr. Mudge's, and that he sent me
out into the field to dig potatoes.  I worked
away at the first hill, but found no potatoes.
In place of them were several gold pieces.  I
picked them up in great surprise, and instead
of putting them into the basket, concluded to
put them in my pocket.  But as all the hills
turned out in the same way I got my pockets
full, and had to put the rest in the basket.  I
was just wondering what they would do for
potatoes, when all at once a great dog came up
and seized me by the arm----"

<p>"And you opened your eyes and saw me,"
said the sexton, finishing out his narrative.

<p>"Upon my word, that's very complimentary
to me.  However, some of our potatoes have
escaped transformation into gold pieces, but I
am afraid you will find them rather cold if you
don't get down to breakfast pretty quick."

<p>"All right, Uncle Hugh.  I'll be down in a jiffy."

<p>About half-past ten Paul started on his way
to Mr. Danforth's counting-room.  It was located
on Wall Street, as he learned from the
card which had been given him by Mrs. Danforth.
He felt a little awkward in making this
call.  It seemed as if he were going to receive
thanks for the service which he had rendered,
and he felt that he had already been abundantly
repaid.  However, he was bound in courtesy to call,
since he did so at the request of Mrs. Danforth.

<p>It was a large stone building, divided up
into offices, to which Paul had been directed.
Mr. Danforth's office he found after a little
search, upon the second floor.

<p>He opened the door with a little
embarrassment, and looked about him.

<p>In one corner was a small room, used as a
more private office, the door of which was
closed.  In the larger room the only one whom
he saw, was a boy, apparently about his own
age, who was standing at a desk and writing.

<p>This boy looked around as Paul entered, and
he at once recognized in him an old acquaintance.

<p>"George Dawkins!" he exclaimed in surprise.

<p>The latter answered in a careless indifferent
tone, not exhibiting any very decided pleasure
at meeting his old schoolmate.

<p>"Oh, it's you, Prescott, is it?"

<p>"Yes," said Paul, "I haven't met you since
you left our school."

<p>"No, I believe we have not met," said Dawkins,
in the same tone as before.

<p>"How long have you been in this office?"
asked our hero.

<p>"I really can't say," said Dawkins, not
looking up.

<p>"You can't say!"

<p>"No, I'm rather forgetful."

<p>Paul could not help feeling chilled at the
indifferent manner in which his advances were
met.  He had been really glad to see Dawkins,
and had addressed him with cordiality.  He
could not conceal from himself that Dawkins
did not seem inclined to respond to it.

<p>"Still," thought Paul, extenuatingly,
"perhaps that is his way."

<p>As the conversation began to flag, Paul was
reminded of his errand by Dawkins saying, in
a tone which was half a sneer, "Have you any
business with Mr. Danforth this morning, or
did you merely come in out of curiosity?"

<p>"I have called to see Mr. Danforth," said Paul.

<p>"He is usually pretty busy in the morning,"
said Dawkins.

<p>"He directed me to call in the morning,"
said Paul, sturdily.

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said Dawkins, a little
surprised.  "I wonder," he thought, "what
business this fellow can have with Mr. Danforth.
Can he be fishing for a place?"

<p>"Mr. Danforth is engaged with a visitor
just now," he at length condescended to say;
"if your time is not too valuable to wait, you
can see him by-and-by."

<p>"Thank you," said Paul, rather nettled,
"you are very polite."

<p>To this Dawkins made no reply, but resumed
his pen, and for the next ten minutes seemed
entirely oblivious of Paul's presence.

<p>Our hero took up the morning paper, and
began, as he had so often done before, to look
over the list of wants, thinking it possible he
might find some opening for himself.

<p>About ten minutes later the door of the
inner office opened, and two gentlemen came
out.  One was a gentleman of fifty, a business
friend of Mr. Danforth's, the other was Mr.
Danforth himself.

<p>The former remarked, on seeing Paul, "Is
this your son, Danforth?"

<p>"No," said the merchant, nodding in a
friendly manner to Paul.

<p>"That's a good joke," thought Dawkins,
chuckling to himself; "Mr. Danforth must
be immensely flattered at having a sexton's
adopted son taken for his."

<p>After a final word or two on business
matters, and arrangements for another interview,
the visitor departed, and Mr. Danforth, now
at leisure, turned to Paul.

<p>"Now my lad," he said kindly, "if you will
follow me, we shall have a chance to talk a little."

<p>Paul followed the merchant into his office,
the door of which was closed, much to the regret
of Dawkins, who had a tolerably large
share of curiosity, and was very anxious to
find out what business Paul could possibly
have with his employer.

<p>"Take that seat, if you please;" said Mr.
Danforth, motioning Paul to an arm-chair, and
sitting down himself, "Mrs. Danforth told me
from how great a peril you rescued her.  You
are a brave boy."

<p>"I don't know," said Paul, modestly, "I
didn't think of the danger.  If I had, perhaps
I should have hesitated."

<p>"If you had not been brave you would have
thought of your own risk.  My wife and myself
are under very great obligations to you."

<p>"That more than repays me for all I did,"
said Paul, in a tone of mingled modesty and
manliness.

<p>"I like the boy," thought Mr. Danforth;
"he is certainly quite superior to the common run."

<p>"Have you left school?" he inquired, after a pause.

<p>"Yes, sir.  Last term closed my school life."

<p>"Then you have never been in a situation."

<p>"Yes, sir."

<p>"Indeed!  Before you left school?"

<p>"No, sir, since."

<p>"You did not like it, then?"

<p>"No, sir," said Paul.

<p>"And was that the reason of your leaving?"

<p>"No, sir; my employer was not satisfied with me,"
said Paul, frankly.

<p>"Indeed!  I am surprised to hear this!
If you have no objection, will you tell me
the circumstances?"

<p>Paul related in a straightforward manner
the difficulty he had had with Smith & Thompson.

<p>"I hope you don't think I did wrong," he concluded.

<p>"By no means," said Mr. Danforth, warmly.
"Your conduct was entirely creditable.
As for Smith, I know of him.  He is a sharper.
It would have done you no good to remain in his employ."

<p>Paul was pleased with this commendation.
He had thought it possible that his dismissal
from his former situation might operate
against him with the merchant.

<p>"What are your present plans and wishes?"
asked Mr. Danforth, after a slight pause.

<p>"I should like to enter a merchant's counting-room,"
said Paul, "but as such places are hard to get,
I think I shall try to get into a store."

<p>Mr. Danforth reflected a moment, then
placing a piece of paper before our hero, he
said, "Will you write your name and address
on this piece of paper, that I may know where
to find you, in case I hear of a place?"

<p>Paul did as directed.  He had an excellent handwriting,
a point on which the merchant set a high value.

<p>The latter surveyed the address with
approval, and said, "I am glad you write so
excellent a hand.  It will be of material
assistance to you in securing a place in a counting-
room.  Indeed, it has been already, for I have
just thought of a place which I can obtain for you."

<p>"Can you, sir?" said Paul, eagerly.

<p>"Where is it?"

<p>"In my own counting-room," said Mr.
Danforth, smiling.

<p>"I am very much obliged to you," said Paul,
hardly believing his ears.

<p>"I was prepared to give it to you when you
came in, in case I found you qualified.  The
superiority of your handwriting decides me.
When can you come?"

<p>"To-morrow, if you like, sir."

<p>"I like your promptness.  As it is the middle
of the week, however, you may take a vacation
till Monday.  Your salary will begin to-morrow."

<p>"Thank you, sir."

<p>"I will give you five dollars per week at
first, and more as your services become more
valuable.  Will that be satisfactory?"

<p>"I shall feel rich, sir.  Mr. Smith only gave
me a dollar and a quarter."

<p>"I hope you will find other differences between
me and Mr. Smith," said the merchant, smiling.

<p>These preliminaries over, Mr. Danforth
opened the door, and glancing at Dawkins,
said, "Dawkins, I wish you to become
acquainted with your fellow clerk, Paul Prescott."

<p>Dawkins looked surprised, and anything but
gratified as he responded stiffly, "I have the
honor of being already acquainted with Mr. Prescott."

<p>"He is a little jealous of an interloper,"
thought Mr. Danforth, noticing the repellent
manner of young Dawkins.  "Never mind,
they will get acquainted after awhile."

<p>When George Dawkins went home to dinner,
his father observed the dissatisfied look he wore.

<p>"Is anything amiss, my son?" he inquired.

<p>"I should think there was," grumbled his son.

<p>"What is it?"

<p>"We've got a new clerk, and who do you think it is?"

<p>"Who is it?"

<p>"The adopted son of old Cameron, the sexton."

<p>"Indeed," said Mrs. Dawkins.  "I really
wonder at Mr. Danforth's bad taste.  There are
many boys of genteel family, who would have
been glad of the chance.  This boy is a low
fellow of course."

<p>"Certainly," said her son, though he was
quite aware that this was not true.

<p>"What could have brought the boy to Danforth's
notice?" asked Dawkins, senior.

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure.  The boy has
managed to get round him in some way.  He is
very artful."

<p>"I really think, husband, that you ought to
remonstrate with Mr. Danforth about taking
such a low fellow into his counting-room with
our George."

<p>"Pooh!" said Mr. Dawkins, who was a
shade more sensible than his wife, "he'd think
me a meddler."

<p>"At any rate, George," pursued his mother,
"there's one thing that is due to your family
and bringing up,--not to associate with this
low fellow any more than business requires."

<p>"I certainly shall not," said George, promptly.

<p>He was the worthy son of such a mother.
