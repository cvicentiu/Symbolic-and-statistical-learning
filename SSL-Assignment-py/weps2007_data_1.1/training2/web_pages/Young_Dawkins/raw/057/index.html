<br><br><b>Extractions</b>: University Relations and UNH Foundation May 2, 2002 DURHAM, N.H. University of New Hampshire President Joan Leitzel will announce the second largest gift in UNH's history on Tuesday, May 7, at 10:30 a.m. in the Sky Box Function Room, located on the second floor of the Whittemore Center. The announcement also marks a record-breaking year at the University of New Hampshire Foundation, which has raised $31 million in just the past 10 months. It also is expected to close a $100 million capital campaign in June, more than two years ahead of schedule. Next Tuesday's event will announce the establishment of a new institute for families and communities, and will include partnerships among UNH's already nationally known centers, including the Family Research Laboratory, Justiceworks, the Institute on Disability, the Child Care and Development Center, and others, as well as state agencies. It is being created to address the new reality of families and women, work, and communities in the 21st century. There will be many media interview opportunities at this event, including with Young Dawkins, III, president of the University of New Hampshire Foundation, who has led the capital campaign efforts; deans from the College of Liberal Arts and the School of Health and Human Services; directors and researchers from the institutes and centers who will be part of the new institute; and Don Shumway, New Hampshire commissioner of health and human services.</small>

<br><br><b>Extractions</b>: Hollis Brookline Schools Annual District Report March 2001 Dear Residents, I am very pleased to share with you exciting news about expanded learning opportunities for all grades K-12 students. There are special and unique qualities about the Hollis Brookline Schools and administrators and teachers are very proud of our many initiations. We operate as a complete team in SAU 41 with school board members, teachers, administrators, students and parents all working in most collaborative ways. This cooperative spirit promotes the free exchange of ideas resulting in decision making that is in the best interests of students. The support of collaborative decision making is most obvious in the development of curriculum and instruction. One hundred and thirty teachers, administrators, parents and school board members representing all schools in Hollis Brookline are actively involved in thirteen curriculum task committees. These committees assure that all grades K-12 curricula align with New Hampshire Curriculum Frameworks and coordinate with national standards. Building administrators and department and subject area coordinators assure that recommendations for improvement are implemented, arrange for quality professional development to support implementation and provide appropriate resources to reinforce or challenge students.</small>

<br><br><b>Extractions</b>: Suzanne Crowley, media specialist at the Sanborn School, teaches lessons to each group of students who comes to the school media center each day. As Crowley teaches, her media assistant, Debra Hyett holds down the fort, checking out books and helping people find materials. Next year, Hyett will be gone, a victim of budget cuts - and by necessity Crowley will spend more time running the library and less time teaching kids and helping teachers. Media assistant Debra Hyett helps a student at Sanborn Elementary. Her job, and one similar to it at each elementary school, will be eliminated next year. Photo by Tim Jean Hyett is one of nine people in the Andover schools - six with full-time positions and three with part-time positions - who will find themselves without Andover jobs next year, even if the $1.13 million override is approved, according to Superintendent Claudia Bach. The budget calls for the elimination of the equivalent of 12 full-time positions. While several employees will find jobs at the new schools, six full-time and three part-time workers will not. Elementary school media centers - once called libraries - are an area targeted by the cuts. Full-time elementary media assistants at South, Sanborn and Bancroft Schools will lose their jobs, along with part-time workers at West Elementary and Shawsheen schools. These five people assist the media specialists (school librarians in the old vernacular) in running the library.</small>

<br><br><b>Extractions</b>: Preliminary Guidance for Migrant Education Program, Title I, Part C Public Law 103-382 To help all children reach high academic standards, many states, school districts, and schools will need a new kind of technical assistance. They will need comprehensive assistance that is driven by the needs of families and children and that can provide tools and information to help them leverage all available resources in order to improve teaching and learning for all children. To that end, the Department is creating regional technical assistance centers to provide comprehensive, high-quality assistance and information. The Depart ment is also changing the way it relates to the field by shifting its focus from monitoring for compliance to providing support to enhance program quality. The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), which houses the Office of Migrant Education, has a new organizational structure that is built around ten regional service teams. Existing program offices, including the Office of Migrant Education, will retain a small program base, but will provide most services to OESE grantees through teams that have staff with expertise in OESE's programs. This new structure signals a new relationship with states and local operating agencies. Rather than focus on providing program-specific advice, the restructured OESE will use cross-program teams to encourage and support state and local efforts to integra te services and collaborate across programs. In anticipation of this change, OESE began in 1994-95 to conduct integrated reviews of federally funded education programs. Integrated reviews are on-site observations and assessments performed by a team of s taff members from two or more program offices within the Department. Each focused on the progress of systemic reform efforts within a state and explored how individual federal programs fit within that broad reform effort. The Office of Migrant Education participated in all of the initial integrated reviews.</small>
