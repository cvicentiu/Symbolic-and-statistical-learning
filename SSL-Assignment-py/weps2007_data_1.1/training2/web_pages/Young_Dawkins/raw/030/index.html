[Il Manicomio]]<br><br><I>"It's not really work, <br>it's just the power to charm..."</I><br><br>The experiment in silence continues today, although with difficulty. Last night I became easily and increasingly agitated. and by the most inconsequential of things. I am hoping this is not a response to this exercise, but instead an indicator that I am about to catch a cold. (I have noticed this pattern of late.) Nothing so far today, save a very sore neck and continued agitation. A friend suggests chiropracty, but my lone venture there was <I>miseria in excelcis</I>. Aspirin, baby, that's the ticket.<br>_________________________<br><br>A wonderful, beautiful, mesmerizing Full Moon rising over Portsmouth Harbor capped an eventful day yesterday. All the papers for APBv2 funding are in order. Now, only Domino #2 requires tippling later this week.<br><br>Very big changes are on the way. I am partly excited, partly terrified...much of this has a surreal quality about it. The Universe drives sometimes like a bat out of hell.<br><br>

[Il Manicomio]]<br><br><I>"I did not believe the information /<br>I just had to trust imagination..."</I><br><br>I spent more time in silence this morning, doing my best to simply listen to the world around me. This has had some noticeable effects, and all positive:<br><BLOCKQUOTE><B>•</B>  The chatter in my head is greatly reduced.<br><B>•</B>  I am calmer, less agitated, and my breathing is more natural.<br><B>•</B>  I perceive all my senses are heightened, especially sight, touch and hearing.<br><B>•</B>  Certain insights into nagging problems appear possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>To this last point, a new and significant further understanding re: forgiveness is coming into view. (More on this, perhaps, if it is appropriate.) And so for now, I am going to try to speak as little as possible. Try it for just a day at first. Just to see what happens.<br>_________________________<br><br>The Mahavishnu Orchestra has slipped into iTunes rotation — <I>Birds Of Fire</I> — and I'm instantly lost in an extraterrestrial waltz.<br><br>Oh yes: Domino #1, fallen.<br><br>

[The Keep]<br><br><I>"It is shining..."</I><br><br>A picture-perfect day today. I arose early again and spent the better part of the morning in silence. After some household duties, the afternoon was spent my dear pals, the drums. A long chat before dinner with Trogdor (who has just been inducted into NHS and informs me of his 3.95 senior year GPA...my goodness!), and then I settled in for more quiet time before treating myself to <I>Dead Like Me</I>. <br><br>All in all, a beautiful and peaceful Sunday!<br>_________________________<br><br>One more day.<br><br>

[The Keep]<br><br><I> “I need a fix ‘cuz I’m goin’ down...”</I><br><br>Up early, fed all cats, coerced Eno to take his meds, threw a load in the washer, straightened up the drum room (it was piled high with equipment), managed some items I’m selling on eBay, answered emails, and did a little programming on the V-Drums. Looked up, and it was only 9:20. <I>What the hell?</I> Okay, WHO stole me and replaced me with a pod person?<br>_________________________<br><br>Later in the day, I drove to Portland with 3D to pick up her new car. For a lark, we decided to duck into Rí-Râ for a bite and bumped into her stepdad, who was up vacationing from Atlanta and staying at The Abbey. A disappointing meal followed, but the company and the Guinness was most extraordinary.<br><br>By the time I returned to The Keep, my stomach was weighing in (no pun intended) with its luncheon review: <I>Pub bangers, two thumbs down </I>(and hopefully not a chuck-up). After this, it’s time to drift off to Mindless TV Land with a tall glass of ice water and  Pepto-Bismol chaser.<br>_________________________<br><br>Two days to Domino Drop #1.<br><br>

[Il Manicomio]<br><br><I>"I'm still yawning <br>when I'm in the middle of a dream..."</I><br><br>Not much sleep again last night. It was much quieter, but somehow I kept waking up at the faintest sound...seriously, a cat walking on the carpet was all it took around 3:45. Maddening.<br>_________________________<br><br>Three days until the penultimate domino is slated to fall. I dare not breathe.<br><br>

[Il Manicomio]<br><br><I>"We know all our lines so well / <br>We've said them so many times / <br>Time and time again / <br>Line and line again..."</I><br><br>Last night I fell asleep on the couch for 10 minutes or so, only to wake up feeling as if I had been run over by a truck. Headache, body ache, nausea, the whole bit. Fearing the onset of the flu — just about everyone at <I>Il Manicomio</I> has been hacking or sneezing of late — I took some meds, chugged some juice and went to bed. What followed was a night-long parade of police and fire sirens. You'd have thought there was a Blitz reenactment going on...I half expected to see morning reveal a bombed-out hamlet that was once Dover. But all the sun lit up were the bags under my eyes...I look like Bela Freaking Lugosi. I was so out of it, so completely unable to focus, it took me five minutes to put on my socks. ("Open end on the foot first, right?") And the sirens continued...I had to dodge more fire trucks on the way into work. And yet: no accidents, not one whiff of smoke, nothing.<br><br>It feels like I'm in a Jean Cocteau film...and dammit, I can't remember my French.<br><br>

[Il Manicomio]<br><br><I>"Gabriel before me, Raphael behind me,<br>Michael to my right, Uriel on my left side,<br>in the circle of fire..."</I><br><br>At long last, some positive news regarding APBv2. Legal and financial obstacles appear to have been cleared, and the wait now begins for two small remaining dominoes to topple. I am resisting the urge to proclaim success until the almost-done-deal is no longer almost, but things are indeed looking bright!<br><br>A sincere "thank you" to all who have been keeping the inner candles burning. XOXOXO<br>_________________________<br><br>More dust has settled from Monday night's gig. While I remain very happy with my playing, and even more with the performance of the other Dreamers, I find myself arriving at a destination where a turn in the road is required.<br><br>In Tibet, one moves clockwise always while spinning the prayer wheels (also clockwise). Perhaps, then, According To My Dream moves <I>to the left...</I><br><br>

[Il Manicomio]<br><br><I>"I like the way the music goes; <br>there's a few good guys who can play it right..."</I><br><br>A2MD's performance last night was <I>Theatre of the Weird,</I> from beginning to end. Upon arriving at the venue, I noticed the marquee and posters had spelled out name "Atoomd." What the hell? "E tu, MD" I can see, perhaps even "Aytoo Emdee," but this? Astonishing creativity at work here. <br><br>The lad behind the bar was none too happy when a member of the band asked for a marker to correct the error. He was obviously having a bad day, which I can most certainly understand. Still, when one is in the "people business" and demonstrates a less than hospitable face before a even a single person has arrived for drink and general merry-making...this perhaps is an indicator of the need to consider a change in profession. Oh well, I thought, <I>let it go.</I> There's work to be done. (I did, at that moment, instruct all band members that forever more, the group was to be referred to by its full name only.)<br><br>I parked outside at 5:54 and brought my first load if gear in. Upon returning to the car to get my last load, I noticed a parking ticket for an expired meter, time-stamped at 5:58. Parking after 6:00, of course, is free. Ohferchrissakes. But I let that go too.<br><br>We were scheduled to begin playing at 8:00, although it is common practice to wait until the room fills, say 8:30. Looking around the room, the band, readers and those guest-listed outnumbered the other patrons 2-to-1, so we elected to wait a bit. This did not prevent the bartender from chewing one musician a new asshole. Okay, fine, let that go as well. <I>1-2-3-Play.</I> The first set struggled through the initial getting-the-sound right, but quickly settled into the groove. The playing was right snappy all around, and the readers, especially young KT, were on fire. The still-small-but-slowly-growing crowd was most enthusiastic, and before we knew it more than an hour of words and music had passed.<br><br>Immediately after the set, KT informed us that she was being ushered out of the club. Two weeks shy of her 21st birthday, the bartender was laying down the law. I politely asked him to explain what was going on, and received a seriously gruff and defensive response. I explained that I had no intention of asking him to break the law or otherwise place the establishment in jeopardy; running the club is his responsibility, and deciding who stays and who goes is his right. I was merely inquiring about actions which were about to significantly affect my ability to carry out my responsibilities, which is my right. Further, I caught him in two, shall we say, "Ratherisms." One, that the state liquor commissioner was "in the club"; I personally know this man through my business, and he was nowhere in sight all evening. The second was that there were "no exceptions" to the under-21 rule; however, the establishment itself employs at least one such individual on its wait staff, and an exception for KT — who could technically have been considered in the employ of the venue for the night — could have been made. <br><br>But reason was not prevailing, and it was time to let go of this situation as well. KT went outside to sit in the car for the rest of the night, and we scrambled with the other readers to fill the void with partially remembered poetry and on-the-spot musical compositions. The remaining two sets went extremely well, the band playing better and better as the night went on. By midnight, the club was full of (mostly) enthusiastic listeners.<br><br>Following, some tense moments with Mr. Bartender regarding payment, and efforts to calm an understandably agitated KT. This was not her idea of a debut performance with the band.<br><br>Back at The Keep, I was bit agitated myself, and so decided to unload and stow equipment to work off the stress. By 2:00 am I was in bed, slept like a stone, and woke surprisingly refreshed this morning.<br><br>Oddly — or perhaps not — I've been getting emails today from all concerned, each politely acknowledging a fine time. I'm not sure if my hesitation to accept this at face value is a reflection of acute perceptive powers or deep-seeded neurosis. What is clear to me is that the challenges of playing out are both significant and surprising. The rewards of playing, then, must be equally so.<br>

[Il Manicomio]<br><br><I>"Lost in thought in search of vision <br>as the Moon eclipsed the Sun..."</I><br><br>I am as scattered today as a fistful of wildflower seeds tossed in a windstorm. Concentration is only through force of will, and fleeting at that. Nevertheless, <I>focus, focus, focus...</I><br>___________________________ <br><br>Positive energies and good thoughts — such as they can be mustered — are skyward today as a critical APB(2) decision hangs in the balance. Also, A2MD is at the Press Room tonight, and any residual benefactions from the Universe would be most welcome.<br><br><I>"Letting the Universe drive..."</I><br><br>

[The Keep]<br><br><I>"...for a while while I'm speaking you know how much you hate to be interrupted maybe spend some time alone fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesn't always have to be about you I've been wanting your undivided attention..."</I><br><br>It's absolutely beautiful today. The rain has finally stopped, the humidity is gone, and there's a serious touch of Fall in the air. This is why I love New England. It took me hours to get off the back porch...<I>"Just one more cup of coffee..."</I><br>_________________________<br><br>I spent quite a while helping Trogdor grapple with his college applications. Writing has never been his strong suit, and so organizing his thoughts into a coherent and compelling narrative is proving to be a particular challenge. But boy, he is <I>fearless,</I> and keeps diving back into it, draft after draft. I believe Dad could learn a thing or two from the young man's determination.<br>_________________________<br><br>More difficulties working around the acoustic kit...the limbs, for some reason, are not responding as directed. It has been suggested to me that my mind is preoccupied, and that from this un-centered place, nothing of consequence is likely to happen. Finding truth here, I took a half-hour to sit and clear the mind. This helped a little, but only. So I took another half-hour and repeated the exercise. This time, a bit better. Still, I couldn't find the "off switch"...the constant chit-chat chit-chat chit-chat blocking the energy. Rrrrrr...<br><br>
