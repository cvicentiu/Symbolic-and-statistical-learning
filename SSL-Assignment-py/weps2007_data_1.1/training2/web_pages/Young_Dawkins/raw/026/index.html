<p><font size="2">Born and raised in East Africa, Dawkins grew up amid one of 
the most irresistible bioscapes on Earth. Dawkins came to Oxford in 1959 as 
an undergraduate, and eventually came under the spell of Niko Tinbergen, the 
eminent Danish biologist. Author of The Study of Instinct and winner of the 
Nobel Prize in biology for his pioneering work on animal behavior, Tinbergen 
was one of the first of the modern ethologists (biologists who explore and explain 
the nature of animal behavior). What is instinct? Tinbergen would ask. What 
behavior is learned? How can we truly know the difference? How does behavior 
change? How do animals communicate? How do animals behave differently in groups 
than they do as individuals? Why do animals cooperate? How do they compete? 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Ethology, as Tinbergen constantly stressed, was a highly interdisciplinary 
biological science, requiring insights into psychology, physiology, ecology, 
sociology, taxonomy, and evolution. Tinbergen focused on the eternal tension 
between the breadth of behaviors observed in nature and a scientist's need to 
reduce these behaviors to a set of fundamental principles. &quot;My own dominant 
recollection of his undergraduate lectures,&quot; Dawkins recalls, &quot;was 
that I was particularly taken with two phrases of his - behavior machinery and 
equipment for survival. When I came to write my first book, I combined them 
into the brief phrase survival machine.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Dawkins developed a special prot??mentor relationship with 
Tinbergen. After a stint at the University of California at Berkeley, Dawkins 
returned to his alma mater, where he ultimately became a fellow at New College 
(he still teaches there). </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Dawkins's dual interest in the nature of machines and the 
machinery of nature took place amid the rise of molecular biology. Just a few 
years after Francis Crick and James Watson's 1953 discovery of the double helix, 
the molecular biologists - not the naturalists, zoologists, or ethologists - 
began calling the intellectual shots in biology. The increased ability to track 
and explain what the genome was and what it was doing - classic reductionalist 
science as opposed to mere descriptive taxonomies - radicalized the way nature 
was observed. Centuries of animal breeding had, of course, created an explicit 
awareness of links between genetic endowment and behavior. The double helix 
became the new scaffold for erecting theories of evolution. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">For the young Dawkins, the ethology of Tinbergen quickly became 
the conceptual lens through which he viewed the world. Behavior, say of the 
chicks he studied as a graduate student, was the empirical observation that 
Dawkins sought to identify and explain. At the same time he was observing chicken 
processing, Dawkins was busy processing his data with a clunky punch-tape Eliot 
803. The machinery metaphor - the s ideas ultimately welded itself to Dawkins's 
strong notions of the primacy of the gene. What happens to scientific thinking 
if the survival machine is defined by the machinery of the genes? </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Amid this primordial soup of new paradigms, Richard Dawkins 
the ethologist rapidly mutated into an evolutionary biologist. In 1965, he hit 
upon an idea breathtakingly simple to understand but extraordinarily powerful 
in its implications. In essence, Dawkins argued for an ethology of the gene: 
How do genes communicate? How do genes behave differently in groups than they 
do as individuals? Why do genes cooperate? How do genes compete? The same questions 
ethologists ask about chicks and geese and chimpanzees are virtually identical 
to the sorts of questions they should be asking about the genome and its genes. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Others had played with this notion before, but Dawkins made 
it his own and aggressively pushed it into the mainstream of science culture. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">As the first true ets bowels. Ideas - like genes - could compete 
and cooperate, mutate and conserve. They, too, are operated on by natural selection. 
Human evolution, Dawkins postulates, is a function of a co-evolution between 
genes and memes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Even that was not enough. Dawkins's intellectual adventure 
went well beyond the ethology of genes and memes to explore an even more radical 
insight into the nature of evolutionary dynamics. This idea, too, was astonishingly 
simple, but it offers a powerful intellectual framework for a new understanding 
of life as an information process. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">What do genes and memes have in common? Dawkins asked. They 
are replicators. Through various but distinct coded systems, they reproduce; 
they effect change in their world so they can propagate, just like viruses in 
either digital or organic form. Dawkins's most powerful paradigm is that the 
unit of evolution is not the individual - the gene - or the meme, but the replicator. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">This was apostasy to Darwinian evolutionists, who took it 
as dogma that the dynamics of natural selection cared only for the fitness of 
individual organisms and absolutely nothing else. But here was Dawkins saying 
that what really counted in &quot;nature tooth and claw&quot; was the replicating 
code beneath the organism. Evolution is really the story of replicators ?er 
alles. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Dawkins aggressively evolved this replicator concept. He noted 
that discussing the evolution of birds without looking hard at the evolution 
of their nests, or at beavers without considering the evolution of their dams 
would be prima facie ridiculous. Each is essential to the survival of the other. 
It is the combination of bird and nest, the combination of beaver and dam, that 
gives a competitive edge to the animals who build them. Not only does the body 
of an organism march to the orders of its genes, but so do the artifacts the 
organism builds or uses. In this sense, the egg uses both a chicken and a nest 
to make another egg, and so the nest, too, is an evolutionary extension of the 
egg. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In biology, the genes in the egg would be called its genotype, 
while the physical expression of those genes - the chicken - would be called 
its phenotype. Dawkins called this marriage of organism to artifact </font><a
 href="http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/extend.htm"><font size="2">The Extended 
Phenotype</font></a><font size="2"> - the title of his second book, published 
in 1982. Still extending the outer limits of his replicator idea, Dawkins used 
this &quot;extended phenotype&quot; construct to look beyond the individual 
and artifact to embrace the family of the organism, its social group, the tools 
and environments it created. These are part of the physical &quot;readout&quot; 
of the genes, the extended phenotype of the replicating code. The invisible 
code in genes are therefore, in a very real sense, manipulating large chunks 
of the visible world to their selfish advantage. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Of course humans - with our massive and complex array of technologies 
- have extended our phenotypes more than any other living species. Just like 
a bird's nest, a beaver's dam, or a groundhog's intricate set of underground 
tunnels, our technologies are now an integral part of our evolutionary fitness. 
In light of Dawkins's work, to be a scientist today and talk about human evolution 
divorced from technological evolution no longer makes sense. In the truest and 
most fundamental sense, human evolution is now inextricably bound with technological 
evolution. Taken to its natural conclusion, Dawkins's idea suggests that humankind 
is really co-evolving with its artifacts; genes that can't cope with that new 
reality will not survive into future millennia. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">What happens to life - to artificial life - when our unit 
of evolutionary observation becomes the replicator? By framing life and its 
evolution in the context of replicators and networks of replicators, Dawkins 
has forced all of biology to reexamine its assumptions of the fundamental mechanics 
of living things. Is technology just what our genes want, or is it a cultural 
conspiracy of our genes and memes? Does human DNA control the technosphere we've 
created and live in and around? What does it mean to say that nerve gas and 
microprocessors are extensions of selfish genes? These questions - as much as 
the genetic underpinning of embryology and neurophysiology - are the sorts of 
questions that evolutionists must now address, posits Dawkins. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">So essential is Dawkins's work to redefining life that he 
might have fairly titled one of his books On the Origin of Replicators and expected 
it to revolutionize science in the most radical fashion since Darwin. But Dawkins 
is not the sort to run the risk of parodying Darwin in this way, because of 
his respect for the principles of natural selection. Already, however, this 
transforming view is proving to be an extraordinarily robust meme that is rapidly 
replicating in human minds. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><hr></font></p>
<p><font size="2">When Dawkins spoke at the first artificial life conference 
in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1987, he delivered a paper on &quot;The Evolution 
of Evolvability.&quot; This essay argues that evolvability is a trait that can 
be (and has been) selected for in evolution. The ability to be genetically responsive 
to the environment through such a mechanism as, say, sex, has an enormous impact 
on one's evolutionary fitness. Dawkins's paper has become essential reading 
in the artificial life community. His multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary fluency 
in fields ranging from ethology to software has made him someone who is closely 
watched not only by fans of his popular books but especially by his scientific 
peers, who range from Stephen Jay Gould to Marvin Minsky to Roger Penrose. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Now 54, Dawkins has few students of his own. Dawkins likes 
tossing around a semi-serious idea of awarding prize money to spur innovation 
and ingenuity in artificial life. (A decade ago, when his Biomorph program came 
out, he offered US$1,000 of his own money to anyone who could find the exact 
image of a chalice, or Holy Grail, he had come across in his own explorations. 
To Dawkins's surprise, a Caltech software jock claimed the prize within a year.) 
Dawkins detailed his new idea in an exchange of e-mail: &quot;My prize would 
be for a visually appealing world in which the life-forms have a visible, and 
preferably 3-D, morphology on the computer screen. They must evolve adaptations 
not just to 'inanimate' factors like the weather (which would produce essentially 
predictable, not emergent evolution) but to other evolving life forms (which 
is a recipe for emergent properties).&quot; </font></p>
