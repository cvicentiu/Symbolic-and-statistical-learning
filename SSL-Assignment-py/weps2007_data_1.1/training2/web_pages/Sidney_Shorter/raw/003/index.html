<h2>
<a NAME="descr"></a>Description and symbolism of the flag</h2>
The law which confirmed the flag as the national symbol was passed in 218.
It explains the design as "a single white star for unity and a white stripe
for peace are placed upon a field of purple, to represent the nobility
of our New Enterprise."&nbsp; The law goes on to provide design specifications,
which are somewhat esoteric, as they were measured to be the same as the
historic First Flag, which was something of a rush job.
<p>There seems to be some confusion over when the flag was introduced.
Legend has it that Steve Wilson designed the First Flag on the same day
that he first carried it -- in the historic Street Vendors' Revolt (against
Angliyaan tax collectors) in Star City in 193.&nbsp; However, purple banners
were favoured by independence advocates since the idea was first proposed
in the 180's, and for a very simple reason that had nothing to do with
nobility -- one of the few colours not represented in the multi-coloured
flags of Angliyaa and Francia (now part of Merit&eacute;) was purple.
<p>It's now believed that Sidney Shorter, a bureaucrat in Star City's colonial
government, first designed the Flag to display at secret Council meetings,
maybe as early as 191.&nbsp; It was this flag that Wilson unfurled during
his historic march through the city.

<br>The proportion of the design elements may be esoteric, but the overall
flag is a conventional 2:3.

<br>Shorter was a member of the Council during its underground days, along
with Steve Wilson and the first President, Arven Gil.&nbsp; He's heralded
today as one of the great black Davenportians.

<p>I saw an article yesterday about relations between Anglophone and Francophone
Davenportians which stated that the Francian settlers proposed their own
flag.&nbsp; I've never seen this before; what flag was that?
<p><i>Ronald Moody III</i>, 30-MAR-298
<br>&nbsp;
<p>That's the Fleur-Purpure -- a purple fleur-de-lys on a white roundel,
centered on a purple field -- and not only did they propose it in 218,
they kept it. You'll still see it flying in La Pen and Nouvelle-Anjou (I
saw it flying from a house in Trois &Eacute;toiles when I was there five
years ago).&nbsp; It's become something of an unofficial flag for Franco-Davenportians.&nbsp;
The PN (Parti Nationale) used to fly it at rallies and speeches all the
time, but they've cut back on that somewhat -- they're trying to avoid
alienating Western voters.
