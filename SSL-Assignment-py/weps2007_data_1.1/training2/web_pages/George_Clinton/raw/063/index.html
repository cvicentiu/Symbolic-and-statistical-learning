<p class="generaltext-black"><b>January 30th, 2006</b><br /><img src="bigmomma2premiere.jpg" width="85" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"><i>Big Momma's House 2</i> was the #1 movie this past weekend, with the largest box-office weekend take for a film opening in January!  (Only the <i>Star Wars</i> Special Edition release in 1997 was higher.)</p>

<p class="generaltext-black"><b>November 11th, 2005</b><br />George has been recording the score to <i>Big Momma's House 2</i> at Fox this week.  SoundtrackNet took pictures from the session, and you can check them out <a href="http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=688" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p class="generaltext-black"><b>September 24th, 2005</b><br />George was in NYC last week to participate as a mentor in the <a href="http://bmi.com/musicworld/musicpeople/200509/rough_cut_lab.asp" target="_blank">IFP's Rough Cuts</a> program. The film-makers selected scenes from their films and George improvised to them on a synth keyboard to demonstrate various approaches to scoring.</p>

<p class="generaltext-black"><b>August 14th, 2005</b><br />Hear George's interview this week (Aug 14-20) with Daniel Schwieger on the new and very hip <a href="http://www.filmmusicradio.com/" target="_blank">Film Music Radio web site</a>.<br>
<br>
After his 8th year as an advisor to the <a href="http://www.bmi.com/musicworld/musicpeople/200509/composers_lab.asp" target="_blank">Sundance Composers Lab</a>, George said this year was his favorite. He was there with John Waters to advise and critique the composers and directors that were part of the lab this summer. <br>
<br>
George's upcoming projects include, "Flakes" an indie film about a New Orleans singer-songwriter who's day gig is managing a "Cereal Bar," "Big Momma's House 2" for Fox, "The Cleaner" for New Line, and "Santa Clause 3" for Disney.</p>

<p class="generaltext-black"><b>June 8th, 2005</b><br />George heads for Paris, France this week. As it turns out <i><a 
href="http://www.metrofilms.com/adirtyshame/">A Dirty Shame</a></i> is opening there at the same time as his visit and the French film music magazine "Cinefonia" will be interviewing him about his work on it. John Waters has a big following in France.<br>
<br>
Also, George has been hired to score <i>Flakes</i>, an independent comedy set in New Orleans for Indigent Films.</p>

<p class="generaltext-black"><b>May 19th, 2005</b><br />George won a BMI Award last night for his work on &quot;The 4400&quot;.
