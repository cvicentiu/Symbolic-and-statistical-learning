<h4><em>Biographical information:</em></h4><p>George Clinton, a younger son of the 6th earl of Lincoln, was connected by marriage with the duke of Newcastle and Henry Pelham.  Clinton served 35 years in the Royal Navy, becoming a rear admiral in 1743 and was governor of Newfoundland, 1732-1741.  Through Newcastle, Clinton obtained the governorship of New York in 1741, but did not arrive in the province until 1743.  Advised first by Chief Justice James DeLancey, then by Cadwallader Colden, Clinton from 1746 to 1750 fought a vigorous and successful battle in defense of the royal prerogative.  During the war with France (King George's War), 1744-1748, Clinton was forced against his will to assume direction of and financial responsibility for Indian diplomacy, troops raised for defense of the northern frontier, and the abortive Canadian expedition of 1746.  After the war his attention was engrossed by struggles with the assembly over constitutional issues and Indian relations.  In 1753 he was superseded by Sir Danvers Osborn.  Clinton returned to England and sat in Parliament, 1754-1760.  His son, Sir Henry Clinton, became commander in chief of the British forces in North America during the Revolution.

<h4><em>Scope and Contents:</em></h4><p>Correspondence, memoranda, and accounts of George Clinton, colonial governor of New York.

<p>This collection is concentrated most heavily in the period 1745-1753 and consists of drafts of Clinton's letters, military memoranda, his letterbook for 1752-1753, letters received, and personal and public accounts.  Much important material in the initial drafts of his dispatches, present here, was omitted in the official copies sent to London.  The collection is rich in correspondence concerning Indian relations and the political history of New York.  There is a full record of his troubled personal finances from 1748 until his death.<br>
