            kept going through several shift changes.&nbsp; The appreciative crowd had their senses
            delightfully overloaded in what turned out to be a long night for the Lord of Funk. &nbsp;
            After the 3 1/2 hour gig, he went into the studio until 6 AM! That kind of energy from a
            man who has survived himself for over 30 years, seen many come and go, and tragically lose
            his son bassman Darrel.&nbsp; George burst into the Motown scene with the Parliament,
            evolved into the Funkadelic and P-Funk, as well as play the Grammies and tour with the
            Chili Peppers. Yeah, he&#146;s legendary, and now that Jerry Garcia is gone, Deadheads
            have embraced him as one of their own. The music is real. It taps in to the raw with a
            synergy of expression that covers the whole gamit of human experience. </font></small></td>

            hotel room before the gig, I thought it a grand opportunity to meet the man.&nbsp; Oh boy,

            candid setting into his stage persona.&nbsp; Outlandish, brilliant, the funkiest showman
            on the planet is a hero to a lot of people.&nbsp; All those people.&nbsp; Surprisingly to

            too late and too old to be Temptations.&nbsp; We were slick in our younger days, but by
            the time we got a hit record with &#147;I Wanna Testify&#148;, the Cream, Led Zeppelin,
            and Jimi Hendrex were comin&#146; over with all of that funky rock &amp; roll stuff... so

            Woody Woodpecker, and Porky Pig don&#146;t get old.&nbsp; We became the
            Parli-Funkadelic-ment thang. Funkin&#146; up things.&nbsp; Then we had our own space, we
            weren&#146;t fast rock &amp; roll or slow blues.&nbsp; We had that mid-tempo<br>

            tone.&nbsp; Rock &amp; roll and blues was still happenin&#146; so once in a while we had

            &nbsp; Well we got it from James Jameson from Motown.&nbsp; They&#146;re the ones who
            named the band the &#147;Funk Brothers&#148; (early).&nbsp;&nbsp; The first electric bass
            I can remember being on a record where it was dominate was at Motown....we just took it
            from there and went crazy with it.&nbsp; We exaggerated everything that we learned...you
            know, bass was definitely the thing that we<br>
            learned was the bottom in music.&nbsp; It was one thing that wasn&#146;t illegal on the
            radio.&nbsp; So we&#146;d try to give you as much of it as we could.&nbsp; Especially on
            pop radio.&nbsp; Bass was like a big d--k. You know what I&#146;m sayin?&nbsp; You just
            didn&#146;t put that on the AM radio.&nbsp; FM you could get away with a little bit, but
            most of the rock &amp; roll and top 40 didn&#146;t have much bass in it as a matter of
            fact.&nbsp; Doo-Wop had a bass voice and guitar, but as far as a bass instrument, it was
            James Jameson and them at Motown who put the funk IN.&nbsp; It was so sophisticated it
            probably got past a lot of people.&nbsp; They did it in unison with vibes and piano.
            &nbsp; The Four Tops and everything.&nbsp; You could&#146;t get away from it, they had
            bottom on that stuff.&nbsp; It used to be upright bass, and that was slick, but I put the
            electric bass all the way on top.&nbsp; I made the drums<br>
            and bass the loudest thing on our records.&nbsp; You can almost run your hand across the
            vinyl and feel a lump in it.&nbsp; I tried to make the needle jump up off the record.
            &nbsp; Yeah, we accentuated the bass.&nbsp; Every time we hit on something that was truly
            funky, we went overboard with it.&nbsp; Free your mind your ass will follow...we just went
            totally NUTS!&nbsp; I mean it was the day of the drugs but it wasn&#146;t as much as the
            record indicated.&nbsp; Even though the drugs may have given us the nerve to do it, we
            weren&#146;t as f--ked up as we sounded.&nbsp; We were out there though, you know what
            I&#146;m sayin?&nbsp; But that was pretty much normal at that time.&nbsp; Everybody was
            experiencing a new vibe &#145;cause that was the thing that stopped the (Vietnam) war.
            &nbsp; Tune in, turn on, and drop out.&nbsp; Till the war dropped out it was what
            everybody did.&nbsp; But the minute it became for sale..(pauses) it was over too. When
            Woodstock happened, drug culture was over, I mean<br>
            as a positive thing.&nbsp; It was business after that.&nbsp; It was &#147;do you want to
            buy a lid?&#148;&nbsp; And when it becomes that, you got to be careful.</font></small></td>

            face="Georgia" SIZE="2">One thing about the interview that PT did with George, he
            didn&#146;t talk a lot about your connection with George Clinton and the funk, so our
            readers probably don&#146;t know that you were actually signed to the production&nbsp; and
            record company that was being formed by George at that time, Uncle Jam.&nbsp; So what can
            you say about that period and some of your initial experiences with George?&nbsp; <strong>Muguga:</strong>
            &nbsp; First of all I&#146;d like to say that a long time ago george used to come and see
            me play at Bakers Keyboard Lounge. I was with Darious Brubeck and that is one of his first
            recollections of me. And I rember Morrie, owner of the Chess Mate Club,&nbsp; called me
            and said there&#146;s this outragious group playing here,&nbsp; and I came down and saw
            one of the funkiest bands I ever saw.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was George with his 5 to 6 piece
            group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 1977 or 1978,&nbsp; I came back from new york and my friend,
            Joey Z,&nbsp; took me to see George record &#150; he was doing something at United Sound.
            He said, &quot;So what have you been doing.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said I just came back from
            New York and put together the group caled Soda Jerks &#150; I sorta gave him a quick rap,
            that I had lived a couple years as a monk and I played with Weather Report, and Brubeck.
            [I told him that:] I saw a guy on TV that had been playing guitar for 6 months and he had
            a hit record, and that sorta inspired me. (I had always wanted to play a little guitar)
            &#150; So I got a guitar and started writing songs to open E tuning.&nbsp; I put together
            a group called the soda jerks &#150; I made my&nbsp; wife play drums and I played the
            guitar and everybody in the group had to play something that they didn&#146;t play before.
            I told him (george) that I loved the funk and I saw the conciences of it (cause it does
            stem from Godspel music &#150; mixing that with James brown and jimmy hendrix kinda
            styles).&nbsp; He said well anybody that could play with Dave Brubeck to Weather Report,
            like the funk and come out of being a monk and want to do &quot;The Soda Jerks&quot; -
            &quot;I&#146;ll give him a recording contract sight unseen and sound unheard!&quot; &nbsp;
            He said &quot;We are recording down at the Disc and also at Superlycs and come on down
            there.&quot;&nbsp; I came down we did one or two quick demos.&nbsp; Here for 20 years I
            was recording for name groups like Weather Report and Winter Consort and so on &#150; but
            nobody gave me a personal recording contract.&nbsp; When I started playing guitar and
            writing songs I got a recording contract. &#133; You have to have a direction &#150; I got
            the direction of the soda jerks from [one time having a job of] packing the soda pop on
            the truck and [thinking of]&nbsp; how I started to listen to music in the soda shop in the
            40&#146;s. </font></td>

            One of the good things about hanging around at the Disc and Superlycs was that I was
            around his sessions&nbsp; and he would invite me to his sessions as well.&nbsp; Seeing me
            play guitar and seeing me sing the soda jerks he almost forgot that i was a regular
            drummer and that I was serriously doing drums and percussion. One day with Sly [Stone] and
            George, theyt were doing a tune, and I began playing my Nada Drum [Muruga's invention] and
            they said &quot;listen to this dude play that stuff&quot; and &quot;put him on some
            tracks&quot;&nbsp; So the next thing you know I started recording tracks with them &nbsp;
            Some of it was &quot;Urban Gollorlias,&quot; &quot;Smell My Finger,&quot; and &quot;Atomic
            Dog&quot; - the things from about 1980 to 1985 - I began hanging around with them in the
