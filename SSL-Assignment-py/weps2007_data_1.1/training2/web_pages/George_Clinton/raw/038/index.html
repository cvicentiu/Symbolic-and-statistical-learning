<H3>Information About The Motherpage</H3>

The Motherpage is an ongoing effort by a lot of people to make information
about P-Funk and related projects available to the funkateers.  Click
<A HREF="pfunk.html#constupd">here</A> to learn about what's been added recently,
and what we hope to add soon.<p>

Many people have put in a lot of time, effort, and other expense to make
the Motherpage what it is.  <A HREF="pfunk.html#contrib">Here's</A> a list of
folks who've contributed to the Motherpage in some way.<p>

Would you like to help?  We'd like your help.  Click <A HREF="pfunk.html#todo">here</A>
for some information on how you can contribute.<p>

<CENTER><H2> Construction Update</H2></CENTER><br>
<p>

The Motherpage will probably always be under construction, as we add more
information and think of new things to do.  But here, we'll let you know
what we've done recently, and what we think we'll be doing in the future.<p>

<b>June 27, 1997:</b>  More touch-up changes:

<ul>
<li>Several new <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/links.html">links</A> added.<p>
</ul>

<b>April 12, 1997:</b>  Some touch-up changes have been made recently:

<ul>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/discog-prod.html">Productions</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/discog-solo.html">Solo</A> sections of the
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/discog-top.html">discography</A> have been
formatted like the other sections of the discography.  References
to albums in these sections (either in other album descriptions,
or in the <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/pfaq.html">P-FAQ</A>, now are links
to the appropriate album descriptions.<p>

<li>Some new album covers have been added.<p>

<li>The <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/links.html">links</A> page has been updated
with some interesting sites.<p>

<li>The top page to the in-progress
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/bio-top.html">biography</A> section has been
installed.  Although there's no information there at present, this
will give you an idea of what we have in mind.<p>

</ul>

<b>Updates to come:</b>

<ul>
<li>Switching from fixed-width font to proportional-width font for most
of the Parliament lyrics.<p>

<li>A prettier interface for the
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/pics/">graphics</A> we have available.<p>

<li>The
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/list-singles.html">singles</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/motherpage/list-samples.html">samples</A> lists HTML-ized; and links
from songs in track listings to the singles and samples lists.<p>

<li>The rest of the album covers and lyrics (subject to our ability to
get them!).<p>

</ul>

<b>Updates not to come:</b>
Once again, don't expect to see <b>lots</b>
of inline images, frames, funky backgrounds on
your browser, etc.  While these look really cool, they also make the
pages take a long time to appear in your browser, and we want everyone
(even those with slow net access) to be able to find the funk.  We
do, however, want to make images available to people who want to
see them . . .so there'll soon be a collection of images available.<p>
<br>
<HR>
<A NAME="todo">
<br>
<H2>How Can You Help?</H2>
We're always looking for more information.  For instance, there are lots of
graphics we don't have.  On an even higher priority, there are many albums for
which we don't have lyrics or album covers or both.  If you can take the
time to transcribe lyrics for an album we don't have lyrics for, you'd
be making a big contribution to the Motherpage.  If you have images of
album covers, or can produce them, that's a big help too.  And we have
the biography project coming up - if you have information about members or
affiliates of the Funk Mob that'd be relevant for our brief bios, we'd
really love to have it.<p>

If you have something to contribute, or see a content error, write Rob
Clough, the Administrator of the Motherpage, at tmc@acpub.duke.edu, or
just click <A HREF="mailto:tmc@acpub.duke.edu">here</A>.<p>

If something is broken -- a link which doesn't work, a file which seems
to be missing, whatever -- write Chris Metzler at metzler@denali.fnal.gov,
or just click <A HREF="mailto:metzler@denali.fnal.gov">here</A>.  Please
provide as much detail as you can about where and how the problem occurs,
so it can be fixed as easily as possible.  Thanks!<p>
