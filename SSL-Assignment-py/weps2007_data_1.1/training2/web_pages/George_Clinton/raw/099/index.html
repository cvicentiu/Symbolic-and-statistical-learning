                      <strong class="style11">by Samori Coles </strong></h2>
                    <p class="style10">I could not believe my good fortune. I 
                      was scheduled to meet with George Clinton for a press discussion 
                      in less than an hour. The morning studio sessions had gone 
                      well, but I could hardly focus with the interview less than 
                      60 minutes away. After my last recording session, I gathered 
                      my notebook and headed up to the 4th -floor boardroom to 
                      find out what was really going on with &#8220;The Atomic 
                      One&#8221;. I did not have a chance to prepare any questions, 
                      so I was looking forward to just chatting with Mr. Clinton.</p>
                    <p class="style10">I approached the boardroom and realized 
                      right away that there weren&#8217;t a whole lot of people 
                      in the room. I could see the multi-colored hair adornments 
                      and knew that I was definitely in the right place. I was 
                      invited to have a seat on the opposite side of the table 
                      facing George.</p>
                    <p class="style10">George Clinton talked a lot about his pressing 
                      legal entanglements involving over $100 million in publishing 
                      royalties owed to him. Apparently, the individual who he 
                      hired years ago to administer his publishing had found a 
                      way to wrestle ownership away from Mr. Clinton right under 
                      his nose. That means that every time one of George Clinton&#8217;s 
                      songs comes on the radio, is used in a commercial, is sampled, 
                      or otherwise reproduced, he does not get a penny. The other 
                      guy, who was supposed to have a fiduciary responsibility 
                      to his client&#8217;s needs, now controls all of the publishing 
                      ownership and rights. The wildest part about it is that 
                      the Florida judge who ruled in favor of the other guy in 
                      the George Clinton dispute is the same judge that ruled 
                      in favor of George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida presidential 
                      election scandal.<br>
                      <br>
                      In terms of sampling of his music by urban music producers, 
                      George Clinton has a fondness for today&#8217;s music pioneers. 
                      &#8220;It&#8217;s not the Hip-Hop producers who are getting 
                      over. In most cases, they pay what they are supposed to 
                      pay for the use of my music. The problem is that ownership 
                      of my publishing has been stolen from me, and when anyone 
                      pays for the right to sample my music, someone else gets 
                      the money.&#8221;<br>
                      <br>
                      I asked Mr. Clinton if he felt today&#8217;s music has progressed 
                      or regressed from music of the past. &#8220;The music always 
                      progresses&#8221;, said George. &#8220;We (Black People) 
                      don&#8217;t have a lot of real assets (real estate, cash, 
                      stocks, etc), but we are rich in metaphysical assets. We 
                      have the ability to create music and other art forms that 
                      benefit the entire world. Initially, our contributions are 
                      deemed unworthy and unsophisticated, but once we decide 
                      to discard them, others come and claim them as their own,&#8221; 
                      he said. &#8220;We no longer have a lot of music programs 
                      in our communities. Therefore, Black youth pick up turntables, 
                      samplers and drum machines to create new art forms of self-expression. 
                      And, youth in every other culture try to emulate it&#8221;.<br>
                      <br>
                      After spending an hour and a half with the P-Funk pioneer, 
                      I knew it was time to count my blessings and let him get 
                      on with his business. He was in the process of taping a 
                      pilot for a new Philly-based television show entitled &#8220;Up 
                      Close And Personal&#8221;, which will be hosted by award-winning 
                      Black Music personality Gary Shepherd. The program is being 
                      produced by BEMA (Black Entertainment &amp; Music Association) 
                      and Bob Lott of Philadelphia-based Teamwork International 
                      Productions.<br>
                      <br>
                      Wrapping up, I asked George Clinton about all of the profane 
                      and negative language and images perpetuated by a lot of 
                      today&#8217;s top Hip-Hop artists. Mr. Clinton had an interesting 
                      take on the subject. He said, &#8220;Sometimes we get so 
                      caught up in language, and &#8220;this&#8221; word and &#8220;that&#8221; 
                      word, that we lose site of the bigger problems in the world. 
                      At one time, the word &#8220;Bitch&#8221; simply meant female 
                      dog. Now, it has a negative meaning. Many negative words 
                      in one time and/or culture are meaningless in another. We&#8217;ve 
                      got to stop wasting time fighting over nonsense. I&#8217;m 
                      still waiting for aliens to come&#8221;, he finished. Enough 
                      said.<br>
                      <br>
                      It was an interesting and mind opening experience. George 
                      Clinton has wisdom for the ages. He has a lot of information 
                      that can keep artists from falling into the same pitfalls 
                      that he fell into. I am forever grateful for the opportunity.
