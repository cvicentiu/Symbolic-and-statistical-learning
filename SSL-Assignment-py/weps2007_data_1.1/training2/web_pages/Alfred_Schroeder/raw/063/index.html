<H1><B>The Story of Color Television
</B></H1><P>
 The year was 1946. World War II had just ended, and
Americans were impatient, eager to catch up on all they had missed 
during the war years. Black and white television had made its debut 
in 1939, shortly  before the war began.  Engineered in RCA Labs on 
Route 1, and manufactured by RCA Victor in Camden, the first sets 
"went over like a lead balloon," says Alex Magoun, director 
of the Sarnoff library. Carrying price tags of $200 to $1,000, the 
sets were wildly expensive, and there was little in the way of 
programming 
for them to receive. Americans were still enjoying the novelty of
radio in their homes, and a good tabletop radio could be had for $10.
<P>
After the war, though, the idea of "adding sight to sound," 
as David Sarnoff, chairman of RCA put it, began to sound appealing. 
Production of all kinds of consumer goods, including electronics, 
had been  curtailed during the war, and there was tremendous pent-up 
demand. Magoun says CBS, an RCA rival, boldly announced to a war-weary 
nation: "`Let's leapfrog. Let's go straight to color!'"
<P>
This was not to be. Not right away. A final standard for color 
television 
was not approved by the FCC until 1953, and for many years thereafter 
only a few programs were broadcast in color. Throughout the 1950s 
any color program was a big deal, and it was not until 1966 that NBC 
became the first 100 percent color network.
<P>
As with any invention, there were alternate development branches and 
missteps a plenty. It is difficult to fix the exact date when color 
television was born, but Magoun says late-fall 1951 is as good a date 
as any. The IEEE is presenting a Milestone award to Sarnoff, successor 
to RCA, to honor this accomplishment. Ninety-five percent of the 
standard 
for broadcasting and receiving color television signals originated 
with RCA. Beyond contributing substantially to the development of 
color television technology, divisions of the company, under the 
leadership 
of David Sarnoff, also made the sets and produced programs to fill 
their screens.
<P>
Magoun speaks on the history of color television at an event titled 
"Adding Sight to Sound: Television's Past, Present, and 
Future" 
on the Sarnoff corporate campus on Route 1 on Thursday, November 15, 
at 8 p.m. Glenn Reitmeier, a Sarnoff vice president and architect 
of HDTV, the next generation of television, which also was developed 
at Sarnoff, speaks on where television will go next.
<P>
Dick Webb, who invented the color television camera, was set to add 
his insights. Now retired, and living in Estes Park, Colorado, Webb 
has decided against an in-person appearance. "He said there is 
just too much stuff going on in New Jersey. He doesn't feel safe 
coming 
here," Magoun says. But he is hoping Webb will be able to join 
the gathering via a remote hook-up. The event is sponsored by the 
ACM/IEEE Computer Society and the public is invited. Call 
908-582-7086.
<P>
The first design for color television, the one that came from CBS, 
then a radio network and owner of the Columbia record label, was
mechanical. 
Based on a system invented by Englishman John Logie Baird in 1928, 
it was developed by CBS's Peter Goldmark in 1940. A spiraling, 
perforated 
wheel was at the heart of this early color television. A camera 
scanned 
images as the revolving color wheel spun in front of it. It then 
transmitted 
three fields  --  red, blue, and green, the primary optical colors 
 --  in sequence. At the receiver end a second color wheel, 
synchronized 
with the first, reconstructed the image.
<P>
"The colors were great," says Magoun of a positive attribute 
of this system, which is called field sequential. But the image was 
far from perfect. "The problems of the CBS, or any color field 
sequential image, are inherent in the trade-offs," he explains.
<P>
Each primary color in a frame or displayed image (30 frames per second 
in television; 24 frames per second in movies) has to be scanned in 
at the same time as one monochrome frame. Therefore the eye sees each 
successive color for only one-third of the time. This results is 
flicker 
when something like a runner, or a car, or a basketball moves across 
successive frames. Reducing the brightness of the screen decreased 
the flicker, but resulted in an image that had to be watched in a 
dark room.
<P>
RCA researchers, replicating CBS's mechanical color television in 
their own labs, discovered its limitations for themselves. Television 
sets built around it would need to contain a wheel with red, green, 
and blue color filters, and would need to be very large  --  three 
times the displayed image, or a three-foot wheel for a 12-inch 
display, 
plus the motor to drive the wheel.
<P>
RCA researchers also considered mechanical color television to be 
a step backwards. "They already had an electronic black and white 
television," says Magoun. "They said, `if it's going to be
color, it should be electronic."
<P>
Another reason RCA was against adopting CBS's mechanical system was 
economical. The company had just spent a great deal of money 
developing 
black and white television, and didn't want to see that investment 
go for naught.
<P>
Vladimir Zworykin had applied for a patent on an electronic television 
system in 1923. His iconoscope television camera  --  made of
clear glass, and looking something like a cross between a drum and 
a medium-size saucepan  --  is on display at the Sarnoff technical 
library. Along with his kinescope, a specialized cathode-ray tube, 
it made electronic black and white television practical and 
marketable. 
His portrait hangs in the library, not far from a portrait of David 
Sarnoff.
<P>
Zworykin persuaded Sarnoff that he could develop an electronic color
television in two years for $150,000. It took much longer, and the 
final cost was something like $65 million, but Sarnoff, a determined 
visionary, hung on, even when every other network and manufacturer 
gave up on color television.
<P>
<font size=+1>S</font>arnoff's RCA, which he had joined as a young man and 
rose to lead, made a commitment to electronic color television, and
prepared to take its case to the FCC, which held the power to decide
what standard would be adopted. In the fall of 1949, there were 
"color 
shoot outs," says Magoun of hearings before the FCC. He 
characterizes 
CBS's impatience to get on with it: "`Look, look,' CBS was saying, 
`We have color. It's here now.'"
<P>
But CBS's color television was found to be too flickery, Magoun says. 
What's more, its bulky system did not fit into the 13, 6-MHz VHF 
channels 
that carried black and white television. CBS thought it could solve 
that problem by using UHF channels, which had just been made 
available. 
UHF, says Magoun, allows for wider channels, but produces a picture 
that is significantly inferior to that transmitted via VHF channels.
<P>
Despite its flaws, and despite the fact that it was not compatible 
with black and white television, CBS's color television technology 
was declared the national standard by the FCC in October of 1950. 
RCA sued the FCC to halt the start of CBS colorcasts. CBS eventually 
prevailed in court in late-May 1951. But while CBS had won the battle, 
RCA's delaying tactic had won it the war.
<P>
CBS began color programming on a five-station East Coast network in 
June of 1951. But black and white televisions could not receive the 
programs. This would not have been a major obstacle for CBS in 1950, 
when few homes had a television of any kind, but by the time the first 
color programs were cleared for broadcast, 10.5 million black and 
white televisions had been sold, about half of them by RCA. Consumers 
were not about to buy a separate television to receive the few color 
programs available, and so few were sold.
<P>
Meanwhile, RCA was working at refining its own color television 
system. 
Called triniscope, it was a dot sequential system, as opposed to CBS's 
field sequential system, and was developed from 1946 to 1949. It used 
three cathode-ray tubes, or CRTs, to project each of the primary 
colors. 
This color system used a set of mirrors to combine the colors into 
one image reflected off another mirror.
<P>
Not practical for the average living room, a triniscope television 
set, says Magoun, would have had to be "the size of a laundry 
machine."
<P>
"It was a `kluge,'" says Magoun. "That's what engineers 
call something that works, but isn't practical." As unwieldy as 
CBS's color system, the triniscope's color was even worse.
<P>
The FCC declined to approve RCA's color system in 1946, and again 
in 1949. Soon thereafter, America became involved in the Korean War 
and the government banned the production of all color televisions. 
The delay gave RCA time to refine its system.
<P>
RCA promised the FCC it would do away with the mirrors and come up 
with a color system that used just one tube. "In the winter of 
1949," Sarnoff wrote a blank check," says Magoun. "He told 
everyone in the labs to put on their thinking caps." Working 18 
hours a day under RCA's Harold Laws, researchers came up with 16 
different
proposals. The possibilities were narrowed to five, and then to just 
one.
<P>
Alfred Schroeder, a retired RCA researcher, now living in Newtown, 
Pennsylvania, had applied for a patent for a shadow mask CRT in 1947. 
"They decided to take another look at it," says Magoun. The
researchers decided to go with Schroeder's idea.
<P>
<font size=+1>A</font> shadow mask is a screen full of tiny perforations. 
This color system combined three separate electron guns, one for each 
color, in a single CRT. The electron guns shot through tiny holes 
in the shadow mask, each hitting dots of red, green, or blue 
phosphors. 
In early prototypes, there were 150,000 clumps of phosphors, each 
one containing all three primary colors. "Each gun had to hit 
the right phosphor," says Magoun. "It was a tremendous task 
of alignment. Everyone said it couldn't be done, but it worked."
<P>
RCA's first shadow mask color televisions needed much more tuning
than modern color televisions do, but in eliminating mirrors, multiple 
CRTs, and rotating wheels, the labs had come up with a design that 
would work in the home. As important, it added color information to 
the standard 6-MHz channel, so that existing black and white 
televisions 
could receive color signals.
<P>
The $65-million race to produce a practical color television was a 
success. In December, 1953, the FCC approved RCA's color television 
format, and television sets meeting the new standard went on sale 
the following year.
<P>
The first RCA color sets cost $995, according to Magoun. That would 
be the equivalent of $6,186 today. In 1954, it was enough to buy a 
car, and nearly enough to buy a modest house. The spread in price 
was similar to today's gap between the analog televisions most of 
us have and the newer digital televisions.
<P>
The issue of programming is the same, too. "It's the chicken and 
egg thing," says Magoun. Even people who could afford the 
substantial 
premium for a color set had little incentive to buy one because there 
were few color programs. And producers had little incentive to spend 
extra money on color programming, because so few homes had color 
television. 
The same situation exists today with digital television.
<P>
Despite all obstacles, Sarnoff forged ahead. A self-made man, he had 
emigrated from Russia to the Lower East Side of Manhattan with his 
family when he was nine. At the age of 15, he left school to help 
support his family. Working for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company 
in 1912, he picked up a message relayed from ships at sea: "S.S. 
Titanic ran into iceberg, sinking fast."
<P>
Rising quickly in Marconi, which became RCA after its U.S. assets 
were purchased by General Electric, Sarnoff proposed an idea for a 
"radio music box," for radio channels, and then for a radio 
network, which became NBC, an RCA subsidiary. He then turned his 
attention 
to television, and soon thereafter, to color television, and refused
to give up.
<P>
By the mid-1950s, every other company stopped manufacturing color 
televisions, and few produced color programming. But Sarnoff, losing 
some $65 million for RCA over a decade, persisted, despite the fact 
that he was angering the the board of directors. Finally, in 1964, 
the tide turned, and RCA began to profit handsomely from its 
investment 
in color television.
<P>
The first commercial television program on color film was an episode 
of Dragnet that aired in December, 1953. It was followed by such 
milestones 
as a live telecast of the Tournament of Roses parade the following 
month, the first color broadcast of a president (Dwight Eisenhower 
in June, 1955), the first color coverage of the World Series (Dodgers 
vs. Yankees in September, 1955), and the first colorcast cartoons 
(the Flintstones and the Jetsons in fall, 1962).
<P>
The premier of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in September, 
1961, was a turning point, persuading consumers to go out and purchase 
color televisions. But it was not until 1966 that NBC became the first 
network to show the color we all now take for granted on all of its 
programs. It had taken 25 years from color television to go from its 
earliest prototypes to mass acceptance.  This, Magoun says, is about 
the time every new technology takes to really catch on. He points 
out that radio was used for ship-to-shore communications for more 
than two decades before it achieved broad penetration in American 
homes. The personal computer, available since 1975, is now only in 
about 60 percent of households.
<P>
Magoun, who has been director of the David Sarnoff library for a 
little 
over a year, says so much of the communications and electronics 
technology 
we use every day came out of RCA labs. He is on a mission to preserve 
and display milestones in the development these technologies at the 
Sarnoff library. It was Sarnoff himself who oversaw the installation 
of the dark wood bookcases, fronted with glass, that run along its
walls, and the large glass display cases in the middle of the room.
<P>
<font size=+1>S</font>arnoff, who died in 1971 at the age of 80, studied 
presidential libraries before designing his own. "He spent the 
last 20 years of his life collecting awards," Magoun says of RCA's 
leader. It is those awards  --  bronze medals, citations, and an 
impressive sterling silver model of a sailing ship  --  that fill 
the library. Magoun, however, says that Sarnoff was much more than 
a sum of all the scrolls he collected and pictures of world leaders 
who honored him. "Sarnoff was innovation," says Magoun. The 
rare entrepreneur who appreciated, and listened to, engineers, Sarnoff 
took color television, and so much more, from the lab to practical
use by consumers, hospitals, businesses, and the military.
<P>
Magoun began to appreciate the man, and what he and his researchers 
accomplished, as he spent time in the library researching the history 
of the phonograph record for his dissertation. A student at the 
University 
of Maryland working on a Ph.D. in the history of technology, he did 
research one day a week in the library. As he worked, he spoke with
Sarnoff staffers about his opinion that Sarnoff's library should 
showcase 
technology, not just the man's life, and should do so in a way that 
would engage scholars, school children, and the public.
<P>
Putting forth a convincing argument, Magoun was hired, and has begun
the job of integrating into the library lab notebooks, sketches, and
inventions telling the story of how Sarnoff scientists have worked
on the technologies that underlie so much of life in the 21st century.
Among them is the world's oldest electron microscope. It sits seven
feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. A photo above the microscope shows 
Zworykin working with Jim Hillier, inventor of the microscope who went 
on to become RCA's vice president of research and winner of the Albert 
Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. He is also father of Bob 
Hillier, founder of the Hillier Group architectural firm. "Zworykin 
hired Hillier and provided protection from RCA's beancounters in 
stimulating creation of what could be called the medical electronics 
industry," says Magoun.
 
Also on display, sitting atop a case of Sarnoff's medals, is one of
the earliest optical recording disks. Developed by Bob Bartolini in
the 1970s to early-1980s, it is the precursor of the re-writable CD.
Bartolini is now Sarnoff's vice president of international business.
<P>
Another new exhibit at the library is the science notebook Steven 
Hofstein used in working on the MOS transistor. This metal-oxide
semiconductor 
field effect transistor is the basis for every computer and electronic 
device. "It was a significant breakthrough in the 
early-1960s," 
says Magoun.
<P>
Fleshing out the library's displays a little at a time, Magoun speaks 
of his desire to have more exhibits that would illustrate the 
progression 
of Sarnoff's work. "It would be great to have a line of 
televisions 
from the '30s, and the '40s, and right on through, all showing 
Seinfeld,"
he gives as an example. This, he says, would be an engaging way of 
getting visitors to ask questions, and make comparisons.
<P>
Magoun, a 1981 graduate of Trinity College, studied history there, 
and went on to earn a master's in history at the University of East 
Anglia. One of four brothers, he grew up in Manchester, Massachusetts, 
"between the Perfect Storm and the Salem witches." His mother, 
Faith, worked her way up from volunteer to director of the Lynn, 
Massachusetts, 
historical society. That was not an easy task in the 1970s, Magoun 
says. His father, Frank, became a bond trader after studying history 
in college, and being talked out of a career as a professor by his
father, a Harvard professor who thought the profession did not pay 
enough.
<P>
Magoun wonders if his father would have been happier as a professor, 
yet he himself ran into frustrating barriers on a college campus. 
After earning his master's degree, he returned to Trinity to coach 
track and cross country. As an undergraduate, he had set the school's 
5K record  --  14.40.97, which has yet to be beaten. He enjoyed 
coaching, 
but he was a part-time coach, and as such had to coach six teams, 
while full-time coaches had to coach only two. When the college would 
not make the track coaching position full time, he felt he had to 
leave.
<P>
Magoun is settling into Princeton. Many of his first friends are 
members 
of the Princeton Hash House Harriers. He explains that hashing is 
an extreme form of cross country running where one runner marks a 
course in varied, and difficult terrain  --  behind shopping centers, 
across brooks, through back alleys  --  and the others try to find
their way through it.
<P>
Now the hashers are in trouble in a number of states. The reason? 
Says Magoun: "You have to mark the trail with something. You want 
something biodegradable. What do you use?" Ah, of course, flour!
<P>
The substance works beautifully, but police in at least four states 
have had to respond to alarmed residents, who came upon the stuff
and suspected it to be anthrax. Investigating costs a fair amount 
of money, and peeved police departments have started sending the 
hashers 
the bills.
<P>
Following chalk-marked trails, Magoun continues to run on Sundays
with the Princeton Hash House Harriers. It is one of his few leisure 
activities as he spends 10 to 12 hours a day at the David Sarnoff 
library and working on a website for it. One thing he does not do 
on his time off is watch television. As Magoun prepares to mark color 
television's 50th anniversary, he notes that the sets are as
ubiquitous 
in American homes as are faucets. But he does not own one.
<P>
"After I come home," he says, "the last thing I want to 
do is look at a screen." Even if it displays all of its programs 
in living color.

<font size=+1>O</font>n behalf of the David Sarnoff Library, I would like 
to thank you and your writer, Kathleen McGinn Spring, for the 
extensive 
cover story on the history of the invention of color television (U.S. 
1, November 14). We had a full and appreciative audience of over 250
people in Sarnoff Corporation's auditorium on November 15, thanks 
in part to the article. Those who missed the illustrated history and 
demonstration of RCA's first color television receiving converted 
HDTV signals from NJN are invited to attend the reception for and 
dedication of the IEEE Milestone for the invention of 
monochrome-compatible, 
electronic color television at the RCA Laboratories on Thursday, 
November 
29, at 4 p.m. Please contact Alice Archer at 609-734-2636, or E-mail:
(<a href="mailto:aarcher@sarnoff.com">aarcher@sarnoff.com</a>).
<P>
New Jersey has been the Innovation Garden State at least since Edison
started spinning off ventures in Menlo Park. The state's 20th century 
history is filled with the technologies we take for granted, from
electronic television and antibiotics to the transistor and liquid 
crystal displays. It is in everyone's best interest to promote that 
history, for the sake of education, state pride, tourism, and the 
business acumen that arises from understanding the causes of our 
technological 
and commercial failures and successes.

<P>
<DD>Editor's note: In processing all that data, a few 
signals 
got crossed. At one point the development of monochrome television 
was erroneously juxtaposed with color television. The correct 
statement:
"In 1929 Zworykin told Sarnoff he could develop electronic 
monochrome
TV in two years. The cost to RCA by 1949 was some $10 million in R&D, 
manufacture, service, and programming."
 <P>
Also the story incorrectly identified the inventor of the electron 
microscope: It was James Hillier. "Zworykin hired Hillier and 
provided protection from RCA's bean counters in stimulating creation 
of what could be called the medical electronics industry," says 
Magoun. Hillier won numerous awards for his efforts to successfully 
commercialize what had previously been a laboratory curiosity, 
including 
the 1960 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, sometimes 
known as "America's Nobel Prize."
