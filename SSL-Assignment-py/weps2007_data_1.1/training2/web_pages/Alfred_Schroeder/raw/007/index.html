<p align="left">Dear Christian Friends,</p>

<p align="left">With the unanimous endorsement of St. John's Church Council,
your Pulpit Committee has invited Reverend Alfred Schroeder to preach a trial
sermon in our church on October 18, 1970. Members of the congregation have fond
memories of the year the Schroeders spent in Mansfield; thus Sam and Mary Ann
come to us not as strangers.</p>

<p align="left">Born in Marion, Texas on August 26, 1938, Rev. Schroeder is 32
years old. He was graduated from New Braunfels High, New Braunfels, Illinois, in
1960, and Eden Seminary, Webster Groves, Missouri, in 1964. He received a B.A.
from Elmhurst and a Bachelor of Divinity from Eden. Part of his education for
the ministry included a clinical year at St. John's Church, Mansfield, Ohio,
1962 - 1963.</p>

<p align="left">Upon graduation from Eden Seminary, he enrolled in a 12-week
Clinical Training Program at Missouri State Mental Hospital #1 in Fulton,
Missouri. For this he received credit for one quarter of clinical training.</p>

<p align="left">Following his graduation from Seminary, Rev. Schroeder accepted
a call to Holy Ghost United Church of Christ in St. Louis, Missouri, and assumed
that position immediately following his ordination. He was ordained in First
Protestant United Church of Christ, New Braunfels, Texas, on September 13, 1964.</p>

<p align="left">Rev. Schroeder served at Holy Ghost until February 1, 1970, at
which time he accepted a call as associate pastor to Faith United Church of
Chirst, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p align="left">During his ministry at Holy Ghost Church, Rev. Schroeder served
as<br>
A. Member - Board of Directors, Missouri Conference<br>
B. Member - Board of U.C.C. Neighborhood Houses, St. Louis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairman, Legislative Committee<br>
C. President - Southwest St. Louis Ministerial Alliance<br>
D. Chairman - Youth Ministry Committee, Missouri Conference<br>
E. Member - Social Action Committee, Missouri Conference</p>

<p align="left">Rev. Schroeder's role at Faith Church has been that of Minister
of Christian Education ad Youth Ministry Director. In addition, he has had the
responsibility for almost all of the &quot;program&quot; at one of the church's
two location. This includes working with Women's groups, Senior Citizens, etc.
He has also preached twice a month and done regular pastoral calling.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Schroeder (Mary Ann) was born in Van Wert, Ohio, May 4,
1938. She attended Elmhurst College and received a Bachelor's Degree in
Education. She has also taught school (Elementary) in Elmhurst, Illinois, St.
Louis, Missouri, and Ontario, Ohio.</p>

<p align="left">The Schroeders are parents of three children.</p>

<p align="left">Karl, born December 16, 1963, is a first grade student this
year.</p>

<p align="left">Paul, born March 22, 1965, attends kindergarten.</p>

<p align="left">Julianna, born October 17, 1966, will celebrate her fourth
birthday while her family is in Mansfield.</p>

<p align="left">Rev. Schroeder's purpose and focus of ministry is upon the local
congregation, with the intent of developing and helping to organize the many
resources which are available in local congregations. It is his belief that only
as we use the abilities, time, interest, skills, and finances of the members of
the church, can we truly carry on the ministry to which are are called by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p align="left">An Informal Tea has been planned for Saturday, October 17, from
6:30 pm to 8:00 pm. We know this is a busy evening - - you are welcome to drop
in, even if only for a few minutes - - to say hello to the Schroeders, or ask
any questions you might have.</p>

<p align="left">Following the worship service on October 18, there will be a
congregational meeting at which time all members will have the opportunity to
vote to extend a call to Reverend Schroeder to become Pastor of St. John's
Church. His acceptance is contingent upon the support of 90% of those members in
attendance.</p>

<p align="left">May we ask God's guidance in this important step so necessary
for the continued progress of Christ's work in our church and in the community.</p>

<p align="left">Most sincerely,</p>

<p align="left">THE PULPIT COMMITTEE</p>

Bohland, Chug Floro, James Hoffman, Fran McCoy, Arleen Wright, and Fred Cary,
Chairman.</p>

<p align="left">From the church bulletin dated October 18, 1970.</p>

<p align="left">A HEARTFELT WELCOME TO REV. AND MRS. ALFRED SCHROEDER! With the
unanimous endorsement of St. John's Church Council, your Pulpit Committee has
invited the Rev. Schroeder to preach a trial sermon this morning for
congregational consideration. Currently, Rev. Schroeder is associate pastor
(Minister of Christian Education and Youth Ministry) at Faith United Church of
Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He previously served as pastor at Holy Ghost
United Church of Christ, St. Louis, Missouri, 1964-69, where he took an active
part in Missouri Conference committee work, served a president, Southwest St.
Louis Ministerial Alliance, and participated in community projects. Since his
education for the ministry included a clinical year here at St. John's, 1962-63,
Rev. Schroeder long ago earned a special place in our hearts.</p>

The Rev. Alfred W. Schroeder</p>

<p align="left">CONGREGATIONAL MEETING - to vote to extend a call to Rev.

<p align="left">From <i>St. John's Messenger</i>, November 5, 1970, page 1:</p>

<p align="left">As we approach the season of Thanksgiving, St. John's Church has
every reason to be grateful for God's abundant blessings. We asked for guidance
in the selection of a new pastor and most certainly our prayers were answered in
the enthusiastic response and support of the members when they overwhelmingly
voted to extend a call to Rev. Alfred Schroeder to become pastor of this church.</p>

<p align="left">Because our Church Council, under President Kenneth Miller's
direction, took positive action, St. John's is weathering a period of transition
admirably.</p>

<p align="left">When it was learned that our congregation would be without a
pastor, Mr. Miller appointed a Pulpit Committee, headed by Mr. Fred Cary, which
functioned promptly and effectively in securing Rev. Schroeder for a trial
sermon on October 18.</p>

<p align="left">The evening before Rev. Schroeder's sermon, the pulpit
committee, with the help of other church members, provided a time of fellowship
with an informal tea in the Undercroft.</p>

<p align="left">Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welch hosted the Schroeders and contributed
to the success of that weekend.</p>

<p align="left">During the interim, our congregation is indeed fortunate to have
as supply pastor the Rev. Dr. George Spink who not only delivers stimulating
sermons, but also instructs the Confirmation class which has increased dramatically
in number since he began.</p>

<p align="left">Church Council has begun the renovation of the parsonage and is receiving
cooperation and support from members of the congregation.</p>

<p align="left">We are anticipating the Schroeder's arrival early in 1971. The family
consists of Rev. and Mrs. Schroeder (Sam and Mary Ann) and three children: Karl,
a first grade student; Paul, who is in kindergarten; and Julianna, age four.</p>

<p align="left">Through the united effort of the entire congregation we can now
look forward to an exciting future of growth in Christian love and purpose with
Rev. Schroeder to guide us and lead us.</p>

<p align="left">Amen!</p>
