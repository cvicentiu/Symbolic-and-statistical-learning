<br><br>
Alfred Schroeder Jones was born at Fisher's Ferry, Susquehanna river, a
few miles below Sunbury, Aug. 18, 1835. When he was six years old his
father, Thomas Jones, who was a farmer and the proprietor of a tannery,
died, and his widow with three children returned to Reading, her native
place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The subject of this sketch received his education in the public schools
of Reading; in the classical school of John Kelly, Court street below
Sixth, who had been educated for a priest, in Trinity Lutheran Parochial
school, southwest corner of Sixth and Washington streets, taught by
Constantine Deininger, a linguist, and in the Reading Institute, No. 225
South Fifth street, a classical school of which Prof. James S. Lee and
Rev. Dr. William A. Good were the principals. In the spring of 1857 he
became an assistant teacher in the latter school, which position he held
for several years. Subsequently he taught a select school at Snydertown,
Northumberland county, and public schools in Maidencreek, Bern and Cumru
townships, and at Rehrersburg and Strausstown, Berks county, and during
the summers read law in the office of Amos B. Warmer, but that being too
sedentary for Mr. Jones be turned his attention to the newspaper
publishing business.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In April, 1864, he started the Reading Daily Reporter, the publication
office being located at No. 517 Penn street, having previously
personally canvassed a portion of the city for subscribers, which gave
him needed outdoor exercise. He bid for the city printing, which was
awarded to him, and the newspaper was so successful that the receipts
from its circulation and advertising paid all the expenses from the
beginning until the paper was enlarged at the suggestion of a candidate
for office who promised financial aid, but did not give it, when the
expenses became greater then the receipts, and the publication was
suspended after being in existence six months.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A number of years before he published the Daily Reporter he did his
first newspaper work when he contributed to and edited the Educational
Department of the Berks County Press which was specially intended to be
read by the school teachers of Berks and surrounding counties. He was
then a teacher himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the Civil war was in progress Mr. Jones spent three years in the
employ of the Ordnance Department of the United States Navy, drawing his
pay, nearly $4,000, from the paymaster located at the Navy Yard,
Philadelphia. After spending two years at Scott Foundry, Reading, he was
sent to Fort Pitt Foundry, Pittsburg, where he remained a year, until
the manufacture of cannon ceased there, the war having closed. His duty
was to be in the foundry when the naval guns were cast, note the
different stages of their fabrication in the machine shop, and be at the
proving ground when they were tested with powder and shot, and prepare
weekly reports, which were signed by the Naval Ordnance Inspector, and
sent to the Navy Ordnance department at Washington, D. C.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones had begun the study of shorthand when he was a school boy, and
he put it to practical use when he was one of the official reporters in
the Pennsylvania State Senate during the session of 1867-68. When he
returned to Reading at the close of the session the Reading Daily Eagle
had just been started, and he accepted a position on it, which he has
retained ever since, a period of forty years. He has done all kinds of
reportorial work up to and including the reporting in shorthand of the
proceedings of political State conventions. When he first became
connected with the Daily Eagle he was for some time the only newspaper
reporter in Reading. Later he occupied the position of city editor, and
he now edits the manuscript of correspondents of the paper, of which
there are over 300 in Berks and adjoining counties. Every week he
prepares special articles for the Sunday Eagle, and he has written more
historical articles about aged persons and occurrences in Reading and
Berks county, in olden times for publication in the daily and weekly
press than any other person in eastern Pennsylvania. When he first
became connected with the Eagle in 1868 he began interviewing for
publication the oldest residents, veterans of the War of 1812, persons
prominent in politics, business and other pursuits, and he has continued
this ever since. He is a member of the Historical Society of the County
of Berks, and has prepared historical sketches for the archives of this
organization. Mr. Jones is proud of the fact that he is the oldest
reporter in Reading, and has been continuously connected for over forty
years with such a wide-awake and progressive journal as the Eagle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On April 11, 1861, Mr. Jones was married to Catharine Hammer, daughter
of the late judge Jacob Hammer, of Orwigsburg. She died March 29, 1906.
Two children were born to them, Thomas H. and Lilian H.

<br><br>
Amanda G. Jones, for many years principal of the Bingaman and Orange
street school, in Reading, was one of a family in which many members
have distinguished themselves by their intellectual attainments, either
as teachers or ministers, a distinct scholarly trait appearing through
several generations. Miss Jones, herself, was particularly successful in
her work, in which she was engaged from the time of her graduation from
the Reading high school in 1863, until her death March 16, 1908. She was
a member of Berks County Chapter, D. A. R., by virtue of her descent
from Lieut. Josiah Philips, her great-grandfather. Miss Jones was the
daughter of Jonathan and Joanna (Philips) Jones, the latter of whom
moved to Reading in the spring of 1860, after the death of her husband.
Jonathan Jones, a resident of Chester county, was the son of Samuel and
Rachel (Davis) Jones, and grandson of Joseph and Lydia Jones of Pikeland
township, Chester county. His mother, as Rachel Davis, taught in the
township long before the days of public schools, and was a very learned
woman for her day. In religious faith she was a Baptist, and for
fifty-nine years was a devoted member of the Great Valley Church.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the maternal side Miss Jones traced her descent from Joseph and Mary
Philips, who came from Wales to Chester county in 1755, and whose
remains are interred there in the Vincent Burying Ground. One of their
sons, Lieut. Josiah Philips, was a personal friend of George Washington,
and served in the Revolution, three of his brothers being in the same
company. One of Lieut. Philips's sons, Rev. Josiah, at one time pastor
of the Windsor Baptist Church, in Chester county, was the father of
Joanna Philips, who married Jonathan Jones.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jonathan and Joanna Jones. were the parents of eight children, four sons
and four daughters: Samuel, Josiah, Ann Jane, Rachel D., Mary S., A.
Judson, Amanda G. and Jonathan. Both parents are now deceased, and are
interred in the Great Valley Baptist burying ground. Of the children
there are two living: Miss Rachel D. lives in Reading; and A. Judson, of
Minneapolis, was in early life a teacher, teaching his first term in
Cumru township, Berks county. During the Civil war he served in the
army, for more than three years, in Company B, 24th Wis. V. I., and
afterward settled permanently in Minnesota. Samuel was a soldier in the
Civil War. Ann Jane died aged six years. Jonathan, the youngest, was
graduated from the Reading high school in 1863, served some time in the
army and then entered Bucknell College, receiving a degree therefrom,
and became principal of the Young Ladies' Seminary connected with his
Alma Mater, a position he was ably filling when he died in Lewisburg, in
1882. Mary. S. graduated from Bucknell College, and was a teacher in the
Reading schools.

Surnames: JONES, RODMAN
<br><br>
Charles Henry Jones, son of Hon. J. Glancy Jones, of Reading, Pa., was
born Sept. 13, 1837.   He was educated as a civil engineer in the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, at Troy, N. Y., and served in  the
engineer corps in the location and construction of the East Pennsylvania
railroad. In 1859 he accompanied his father, who had been appointed
United States Minister to Austria, and served as attache to the legation
until November 1861. Having returned to America, he studied law under
his father's instruc-tion, and was admitted to the Reading Bar in April
1863.  In the same year he removed to Philadelphia, where he has since
actively practiced his profession.  He was solicitor to the park
commissioners during the laying out of Fairmount Park, from 1869 to
1874; was the candidate of the Democratic party for city solicitor of
Philadelphia in 1874; counsel for the De-partment of Protection,
Centennial Exposition of 1876; and special deputy collector of the port
of Philadelphia under President Cleveland from 1885 to 1889. In 1890 he
organized The Trust Company of North America,  and served for many years
as vice-president of that corporation.  For   twenty-one years he has
been one of the managers and for the past ten years chairman  of the
board of managers of Christ Church Hospital.  He is an able lawyer and
was prominent as counsel in many of the notable contested election cases
in the Philadelphia courts and made a great reputation for the
thoroughness and ability with which he sifted out the frauds of a number
of municipal elections and unseated the wrongful holders of many
important offices.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones for many years has been identified with the Pennsylvania
Society of the Sons of the Revolution, of which he is chairman of the
board of managers and treasurer, and the Colonial Society, of which he
is president. Several of the papers he has read before these societies,
notably those relating to the encampment of Washington and his army on
the banks of the Neshaminy and at Whitemarsh during the year 1777, are
replete with the most interesting information and charming descriptions
of the thrilling events of that wonderful year, and have attracted
universal attention as the best history of the immortal days of the
Revolution covered by the period of that narrative. He is the author of
a number of works of history and fiction, among them the "<i>History of the
Campaign for the Conquest of Canada in 1776</i>," in which several companies
from Berks county figured conspicuously, under the command of his
great-grandfather, Col. Jonathan Jones, a lieutenant-colonel in the
Continental army; "<i>Genealogy of the Rodman Family from 1620 to 1886</i>,"
containing 2,892 names of the descendants of his maternal ancestors,
among them being William Rodman, who served as an officer on the staff
of General Lacey during the war of Independ-ence and was a member of
Congress in 1812; "<i>Davaults Mills</i>"; "<i>Recollections of Venice</i>"; "<i>A
Pedestrian Tour Through Switzerland</i>"; and "<i>The Life and Memoirs of J.

<b><a name="jones family">JONES FAMILY</a>,</b> p. 354<br>
Surnames: JONES, MORRIS, EVANS, JAMES, LLOYD, REES, DAVIS, NICHOLAS,
EDWARDS, THOMAS, HARRY, LEWIS, BROOMFIELD, SPICER, CORNOG, GEIGER, KUHN,
CLARK, HUEY, VAN REED, SEITZINGER, GETZ, HOFFMAN, CLEMENS, DARRAH
<br><br>
The Jones family was founded in this country by Rev. Thomas Jones, who
was born in the year 1702, in Newtonottage, Glamorganshire, Wales. In
1729 he married Martha Morris, and in 1737, they came to America with
several children, arriving at Philadelphia on July 22d of that year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rev. Thomas Jones first settled in the Great Valley of Chester county,
Pa., where he took up lands, and where his neighbors included a number
of Baptists, mostly of his own nationality, some of whom had crossed the
Atlantic over thirty-five years earlier. In 1711 they had organized the
Great Valley Baptist Church, and in 1719 the Montgomery Church. In 1738
a number of these people, all of Welsh extraction, members of the Great
Valley and Montgomery Baptist Churches, removed to Lancaster county,
Pa., settling along the Tulpehocken creek, near its junction with the
Schuylkill river, and also southwardly along that river, opposite what
is now the city of Reading. The adults of this little company were as
follows: Thomas Jones and wife; David Evans and wife; James James and
wife; Evan Lloyd and wife; George Rees and wife; John Davis and wife;
Thomas Nicholas and wife; James Edwards and wife; Rees Thomas and wife;
Henry Harry; David Lewis and Thomas Lloyd. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These twenty-one persons,
finding themselves to be too far from their respective churches,
requested leave to be constituted into a distinct society, which
accordingly was done Aug. 19, 1738, and the same year the new church
joined the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches. In the year
1740 Thomas Jones was ordained a minister and became pastor of this
church. which was called the Tulpehocken Baptist Church, after the river
which runs through the neighborhood. For two years services were held in
a small log cabin erected on the property of Hugh Jones, but in 1740 the
congregation built two meeting houses on lands presented to it, one
about six miles from the Schuylkill river at Sinking Spring and the
other several miles nearer the river. The church continued to prosper
for a time, but became extinct sixty years later, "owing to the
departure of Baptist families to other parts, and the coming of Germans
in their stead." The lands owned by the church passed into the
possession of the Philadelphia Baptist Association. Those parts on which
the ancient graveyards are located are still held by the Philadelphia
Baptist Association, but are at present under the care of the First
Baptist Church of Reading.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rev. Thomas Jones died March 22, 1788, in his eighty-seventh year, and
his wife Martha (Morris) died June 9, 1799, in her ninety-third year.
They are buried in the graveyard of the Great Valley Baptist Church in
Chester county, where their graves are suitably marked. Their children
were: Thomas, Samuel, Griffith, Elizabeth and Sarah. They became allied
by marriage with the Davis, Broomfield, Spicer, Lloyd and Cornog
families, and from them sprang a host of descendants, many of whom still
live in the vicinity of the homes of their fore-fathers, though the
majority are widely scattered over the United States.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thomas Jones, son of Rev. Thomas and Martha (Morris) Jones, was born in
Wales in 1733. On Oct. 6, 1762, he married Mary Broomfield, and to them
were born the following named children: Martha, Susanna, Sarah, Mary and
Samuel. Of these, Martha m. Llewellyn Davis; Sarah m. Roger Davis; Mary
m. Mr. Geiger; Susanna m. Dr. Kuhn, of Lancaster, Pa. The father of this
family was a large land holder in Heidelberg township, Berks county, and
was a farmer by occupation. "At the very beginning of the Revolution he
assisted in organizing the Associators of Berks county, and was in
active service for a time as Major of one of the battalions of this
county." He was one of the eight delegates from Berks county to the
Provincial Convention which met at Philadelphia July 15, 1776, "for the
express purpose of forming a new government in this Province on the
authority of the people only." The convention appointed a committee of
Safety, approved the Declaration of Independence, and prescribed for
justices of the peace, oaths of renunciation of the authority of George
III., and oaths of allegiance to the State of Pennsylvania. Dr. Benjamin
Franklin was president of the convention. Thomas Jones was commissioner
of Berks county from 1779 to 1786. He died in March, 1800, and is buried
in the Baptist graveyard at Sinking Spring. He was the last surviving
male member of the Tulpehocken Baptist Church. His wife, who survived
him several years, was buried at his side, and their graves were marked,
but the stones were removed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Samuel Jones, son of Thomas and grandson of Rev. Thomas, was born on the
homestead in Heidelberg township where his father erected a house in
1775. This house is still standing. He was a farmer by occupation, owned
a large and valuable tract of land in Heidelberg township, and had
slaves, whom, however, he set free.  The most noted of these slaves was
Dinah Clark, a well known character in Reading in her day. The negro
quarters occupied by the slaves on the Heidelberg farm are still
standing. Samuel Jones donated the land upon which the eight-cornered
building at Sinking Spring, used first as a Baptist meeting house, later
as a school house, now as a dwelling -- was erected. The original deed
of this property is held by the First Baptist Church of Reading.
Samuel Jones married Elizabeth Huey, and to them were born four
children, Thomas H., John H., Margaret and Mary C.
<br><br>
(1) Thomas H. Jones was engaged in the iron business at Leesport, this
county, and at the Windsor Furnace at Hamburg. He married Elizabeth Van
Reed Evans, and their children, Mary E. and Elizabeth E. Jones, are
living in Reading.
<br><br>
(2) John H. Jones married Margaret (Seitzinger) Van Reed, widow of
Joshua Van Reed, and to them were born four children, namely: M. Agnes,
wife of Hon. James K. Getz, at one time mayor of Reading; Ellen A.,
widow of Dr. Christian N. Hoffman; Elizabeth, widow of Dr. S. H.
Clemens, of Allentown, Pa.; and William W., deceased, who lived at
Robesonia.
<br><br>
(3) Margaret Jones m. Dr. Darrah.
<br><br>
(4) Mary C. Jones m. Jacob Van Reed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Samuel Jones, D. D., son of Rev. Thomas Jones, was born Jan. 14, 1735.
In his youth he was baptized into the membership of the Tulpehocken
Baptist Church. He was educated in the College of Philadelphia,
graduating in 1762, was ordained to the ministry in 1763, and became
pastor of the Pennepek Baptist Church, which was organized in 1688, and
is now known as the Lower Dublin Church of Philadelphia. He retained
that pastorate for fifty years, and he was known as one of the most
scholarly Baptists of his day, being the most influential minister of
his denomination in the Middle Colonies. The Philadelphia Baptist
Association in 1764, sent him to Rhode Island to assist in founding
Rhode Island College, now Brown University. He remodeled the rough draft
of the college charter, which then received the sanction of the Colony
of Rhode Island. Later he was offered the presidency of the college but
did not accept it. "He exerted a vast and useful influence over the
rising Baptist Churches of our country, and himself educated many young
men for the Christian ministry. He was a large and firmly built man, his
face was the image of intelligence, and good nature, which, with the air
of dignity that pervaded his movements, rendered his appearance
uncommonly attractive." He died Feb. 7, 1814, and is buried in the Lower
Dublin Church.

George M. Jones, a member of the faculty of the Boys' High School of
Reading, is connected on both sides of the family with some of the first
settlers of the county and State. His paternal ancestors are traced in
direct line to Nils Jones, who came from Sweden in 1638, and settled in
the northern part of what is now Delaware, not far from the site
afterward selected by William Penn for Philadelphia. The original
settler in Berks county was Mounce Jones, who built the. first house in
Berks county at Douglassville, in 1716, which historic structure is
still standing. He was our subject's great-grandfather's grandfather.
Nicholas Jones, grandfather of George M., was a forgemaster at Hecla,
Schuylkill county. He was born in Amity township, and during his
lifetime was prominent in public affairs having been a member of the
Legislature from Schuylkill county in the year 1850. He lived to the
advanced age of eighty-six.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Daniel Young Jones, son of Nicholas and father of George M., was a
resident of Reading, but is now deceased, having died in 1883, at the
age of forty-one. He married Elenora S. Miller, daughter of Daniel and
Sarah Miller, whose ancestry is traced back to John George Spang, who
came to America from Germany in 1751 and settled near Womelsdorf, Berks
county.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
George M. Jones was born Sept. 8, 1874, in Reading. He passed through
the graded schools of that city, graduating from the Latin Scientific
course of the high school in 1891. He then entered the University of
Pennsylvania, where during 1891-92 he studied architecture. During the
summer following, and until February 1893, he was a rodsman for the city
engineer of Reading. Returning to the University he took the course in
Finance and Political Economy. His degree of Bachelor of Philosophy he
took in 1896, receiving honors at graduation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upon his return home Mr. Jones selected the law as a profession, reading
under the instruction of Isaac Hiester, of the Berks County Bar. His
certificate of admission bears date of Nov. 14, 1898, from which time

<img src="phojonesjglancy.jpg" alt="J. Glancy Jones" width="147" height="185" border="1" align="right">J. Glancy Jones was born Oct. 7, 1811, in Caernarvon township, Berks
county. His ancestors were of Welsh origin. His great-grandfather, David
Jones, settled in 1730 upon the Conestoga creek, near Morgantown, and
there he erected and carried on one of the first forges in that section
of the State. His grandfather, Jonathan Jones, was captain of a company
of troops belonging to the Continental Line, enlisted by authority of
Congress, and rendered distinguished services in the expedition against
Canada in 1776. Afterward he was lieutenant-colonel. His death was
occasioned by the hardships of that campaign. Jehu Jones, son of
Jonathan and father of the subject of this sketch, was for many years
engaged in the profession of teacher, for which he was qualified by a
classical education. He died in 1864, at an advanced age.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
J. Glancy Jones was educated at Kenyon College, Ohio, and in 1833 was
ordained to the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, to which
his family had for generations belonged. His inclinations, however, led
him to prefer the profession of the law; and having undergone the
necessary course of preparation he was admitted to the Bar. He commenced
practice in 1842, at Easton, Pa. The judicial district was composed at
that time of the counties of Berks, Lehigh and Northampton, and was
presided over by Hon. John Banks. After a residence of three years at
Easton, he removed to Reading, and was admitted to the Bar of Berks
county, Jan. 7, 1845. He was appointed district attorney for Berks
county, under the administration of Governor Shunk, in March 1847, and
served in that capacity until January 1849. During that period he was
tendered by the Executive the president judgeship of the Chester and
Delaware District.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though successful in the practice of his profession, he very early
inclined to politics. Being a decided Democrat, he became active in the
affairs of the dominant party in his native county, as well as in the
State at large. He was the warm personal friend and political supporter
of Morris Longstreth, the unsuccessful competitor of Governor Johnston
in 1848, and the following year was chairman of the Democratic State
Committee. In 1850 he was elected to Congress from the Berks District.
Having declined a renomination, the Hon. Henry A. Muhlenberg, the
younger, was chosen as his successor for the term beginning in December
1853. Mr. Muhlenberg having died shortly after taking his seat, a
special election was held in February 1854, to fill the vacancy, when
Mr. Jones was chosen for the unexpired term. He was reelected for two
succeeding regular terms, in 1854 and 1856, thus holding the position of
representative, with but a brief intermission, for the period of eight
years. As a member of the committee on Claims, he was author of the bill
establishing the United States Court of Claims. In 1857 he was chairman
of the committee on Ways and Means, a position of leadership which
necessarily secured for its incumbent a national reputation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the election of Mr. Buchanan to the Presidency, in 1856. Mr. Jones
was selected as a member of his cabinet. This selection was ratified by
the Democratic press and party throughout the country with great
unanimity, but Mr. Jones declined the appointment. In February 1857, he
tendered to Mr. Jones the mission to Berlin. "It is my purpose." he
wrote, "to present your name to the Senate for that highly respectable
and important mission immediately after my cabinet shall have been
confirmed. And permit me here to add that I think your mind and
qualities are admirably adapted to that branch of the public service."
This position Mr. Jones declined. He continued his service in Congress
as chairman of the committee on Ways and Means, and was the zealous
advocate and supporter of President Buchanan's administration on the
floor of the House.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the year 1858 he was unanimously renominated for Congress, his
opponent being Maj. John Schwartz, the candidate of the anti--Lecompton
Democracy, which united with it the strength of the Republican party.
Mr. Jones being the special representative of the policy of the Federal
administration, the contest in Berks, as elsewhere, was conducted
largely upon national issues. One of the most exciting campaigns in the
history of the county ensued, which resulted in the election of Maj.
John Schwartz by a majority of nineteen votes. The total vote in the
district was upward of fourteen thousand. Immediately after the result
of the contest was known, President Buchanan tendered to Mr. Jones the
Austrian mission, which he accepted. Upon his confirmation by the
Senate, be resigned his seat in Congress, and left, with his family, for
his post in January 1859. Upon the accession of the Republican party to
power, in 1861, Mr. Burlingame was appointed by President Lincoln to
succeed Mr. Jones at the court of Vienna; but, having been almost
immediately recalled, Mr. Jones, at the request of the administration,
remained in the embassy until the arrival of his successor, Hon. John
Lothrop Motley, in the month of December. At the period of the outbreak
of the Civil war in the United States the subject of the belligerent
relations of the two contending sections devolved duties of a peculiarly
delicate and responsible nature upon our diplomatic representatives
abroad, and, so far as Mr. Jones's sphere of service was concerned, he
sustained his official trust in a manner highly satisfactory to the
administration and the government of the country.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upon his return home, where he arrived in January 1862, the period of
Mr. Jones's public life practically terminated, though he did not cease
to participate in the councils of his party for many years afterward. He
resumed the practice of the law, and carried it on for about ten years,
when declining health compelled him to retire from all employments of a
public nature.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones was, for a long period, prominent in the councils of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, having been frequently a delegate to
diocesan conventions, and having taken a leading part in the measures
which led to the establishment of the new diocese of Central
Pennsylvania in 1871. During his entire political and professional
career he preserved a character of unblemished integrity, and in his
private relations to his fellowmen was equally above reproach. He had
many warm and zealous friends, and succeeded, as few public men succeed,
in preserving the personal esteem of his political opponents, against
whom he never cherished animosity or resentment. He was well fitted to
be a leader of men, and those who differed most radically from him in
political opinion did not hesitate to acknowledge the winning power of
his personal influence. He was a very social man. His domestic life was
especially happy and attractive. His wife, Anna Rodman, a daughter of
the Hon. William Rodman, of Bucks county, formerly a representative of
that district in Congress, was a lady of superior refinement and most
estimable Christian character, and her decease, in 1871, severed the
ties of a peculiarly united and affectionate household.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones died at Reading, March 24, 1878, in his sixty-seventh year,
and upon that occasion the Bar of the county united in a testimonial of
marked respect to his memory and appreciation of his public services.
Two of his sons, Charles Henry and Richmond L. Jones, were admitted to
the Berks county Bar in 1863, having studied law in their father's
office. The latter was a representative from the county in the
Legislature from 1867 to 1869, and the former became a resident and
practitioner at the Bar of Philadelphia. Mr. Jones's eldest daughter,
Anna Rodman, married Farrelly Alden, of Pittsburgh, and died there in
December 1885. His youngest daughter, Katharine, married William Thomas
Wallace, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

John Pringle Jones, first President Judge of Berks county under the
amended Constitution of Pennsylvania, from 1851 to 1861, was born near
Newtown, Bucks county, in 1812. His father died when he was young. His
mother was of an English family in Philadelphia. His education was
acquired at the Partridge Military Academy in Middletown, Conn., at the
University of Pennsylvania, and the College of New Jersey at Princeton,
from which last he was graduated in 1831. He studied law in the office
of Charles Chauncey, Esq., and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in
1834. While in Berks county, in 1835, he determined to locate at
Reading. In 1839 he was appointed deputy attorney general of Berks
county and served in that office until 1847. During this time he was
associated in the practice of law with Robert M. Barr, Esq., who in
1845, was appointed reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court. At
the expiration of the official term of the Hon. John Banks in 1847, he
was appointed to fill this position. By an Act of the Legislature,
passed in 1849, Berks county was erected into a separate judicial
district, of which David F. Gordon, Esq., was appointed president judge,
and judge Jones continued to preside in Lehigh and Northampton counties
until 1851.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1849, Mr. Barr, the State reporter, died and judge Jones completed
two of the State Reports, known as the "Jones reports." In 1851 he was
elected president judge of Berks county for ten years. After the
expiration of his term he devoted himself to literary pursuits and to
the management of the Charles Evans Cemetery Company, of which he was
elected president.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1867, Judge Maynard (of the 3rd Judicial District, then composed of
Lehigh and Northampton counties), died, and Judge Jones was appointed
his successor for the unexpired term. This was the last official
position he occupied. In 1872, he sailed for Europe, accompanied by his
wife, and traveled through France, Italy, Germany and a part of Russia.
He was taken sick and died in London on March 16, 1874. His remains were
brought to Reading and buried in the Charles Evans Cemetery. He married
(first) in 1840, Annie Hiester, daughter of Dr. Isaac Hiester, of
Reading. After her death, he married, in 1851, Catharine E. Hiester,
daughter of John S. Hiester.

<img src="phojonesjonathan.jpg" alt="Jonathan Jones" width="148" height="193" border="1" align="left">Jonathan Jones was a son of David Jones, one of the earliest settlers of
Caernarvon township, Berks county.  He was born in the township in
1738.  Upon the breaking out of the Revolution he raised a company of
Associators in that locality, and was appointed a captain in the 1st
Pennsylvania Regiment, of the regular Continental army Oct. 25, 1775.
He was ordered with his company to the "British Barracks," at
Philadelphia, and acted as part of the escort of Martha Washington into
Philadelphia.  In December he was ordered into Northampton county, Va.,
to protect it against Lord Dunmore.  The alarming state of affairs in
Canada led to the revocation of this order, and, by command of Congress,
he marched with his company of eighty-three men for Quebec, over the
snow and "frozen lakes."  This terrible midwinter march consumed two
months.  After the precipitate retreat from Quebec, he voluntarily
returned, at the risk of capture, and recovered valuable papers.  He was
with Arnold in his pursuit of the British, after the battle of the
Cedars, and took part in the battle of "Three Rivers," June 8, 1776.  He
shared the terrible and distressing sufferings of the army in its
disastrous retreat to Ticonderoga, and underwent at that post the severe
and exacting routine of military duty incident to its fortification and
defense to resist the attack of General Carleton.  He was stationed
there from July 9 to Nov. 15, 1776.  On Oct. 27th the time of enlistment
of his men ran out, but through his exertions they consented to remain
as long as the enemy was in their front.  After a year's active service
he was promoted to the rank of major, Oct. 25, 1776, and to
lieutenant-colonel of his regiment,
which had become the 2d under the new arrangement, March 12, 1777.  His
constitution was so shattered by the hardships and exposure of the
campaign against Canada that he was obliged to return home to recruit
his health in the winter of 1776-77.  Having partially recovered, he
rejoined his regiment in the spring of 1777, the command of which
devolved upon him after the resignation of Col. James Irvine, June 1,
1777.  Two companies of the regiment were then on duty in Philadelphia
and the remainder were guarding the upper ferries of the Delaware.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Increasing ill health, however, obliged him to resign his commission in
the latter part of July.  In December,
1778, he was appointed by the Assembly a commissioner under the test
laws, and he was a member of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania from
Berks county from October, 1779, to October, 1780.  His health continued
steadily to decline, and he was shortly afterward stricken with
paralysis, of which he died, after a lingering illness,
on Sept. 26, 1782, at the early age of forty-four.  He was buried at
Bangor Church, Churchtown, of which members of his family had been
wardens and vestrymen from its earliest foundation.<br><br>

Capt. Richard Hall Jones, who in his lifetime was a citizen useful to
his town, his State and his country in peace and in war, came of loyal,
sturdy pioneer stock, descending from the Swedes whose colony was
planted at Philadelphia before William Penn was born.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="phojonesrich.jpg" alt="Richard Jones" width="144" height="197" border="1" align="right">In a case in the Philadelphia library, on Locust street , is an old
volume, "Nya Sverige," by the Rev. John Campanius Holm. It was published
at Stockholm in 1702, and contains the first printed account of the
colonial settlement of Pennsylvania. The Rev. Mr. Holm was chaplain of
the company of Swedish colonists who came over with Capt. John Printz in
three ships in 1643, and established a permanent settlement on Tinicum
Island.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, sent out these early settlers,
and they were provided for spiritually by three missionaries, and the
first church was built by the government of their mother country. This
was a block house, which stood on the present site of Old Swedes Church,
(erected in 1700) at Swanson and Christian streets. These first settlers
were accustomed to the use of boats, and were wont to use the water
instead of the paths and half-opened Indian trails along the shore. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A
history of any of the descendants of these pioneers would be incomplete,
indeed, without a short sketch of their old house of worship, "the
meeting place at Weccacoe," now Gloria Dei or Old Swedes Church. The
present edifice, as stated, was erected on the site of the old block
house in 1700. Originally its ministers were of the faith of the
National Church of Sweden-Lutheran in faith, and Episcopal in
government. To the energies of the first pastor, the Rev. Mr. Rudman (or
Ruchman) was due the erection of the present building. From 1700 to 1786
ten ministers occupied the pulpit, and then as the Swedish languages and
purposes had died out, the congregation elected a minister of the Church
of England, and of that faith it has since continued, though of such
great length have been the pastorates that the present priest is but the
fourth of his faith, and his term of faithful service lacks but one year
of four decades. The interior has been remodeled several times, but the
quaint hint of for-mer days is seen, and the aisle is inlaid with the
tablets of the ten Swedish ministers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The footprints of an elder race are here, And memories of an heroic
time - And shadows of the old mysterious faith."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Philadelphia. there is yet to be seen a house that was built by one
of the companions of Capt. John Printz's voyage. It stands on the
desolate flats west of the Schuyl-kill, and was built (family tradition
says in 1650) by Jo-nas Nielson, who for some years before building this
house dwelt in a cave, the site of which is still pre-served in the side
of the hill which slopes from the front door of the cottage to what was
originally the bank of a navigable creek. Ships from the Delaware
brought up merchandise to the front door of the cottage, and the cave,
the first home of Jonas Nielson and where he partly reared his eleven
children, became a store house for the goods brought up for traffic with
the Indians. The old house with its two rooms and garret was hardly
larger than a packing box. In the ground floor room there is an immense
fire place, now walled up, extending almost the entire width of the room
and reaching nearly to the ceiling, which is itself scarcely more than
seven feet high. In front of this fireplace George Washing-ton once sat
as guest. Sessions of court were held where -ever a building was
available, and the old Jonas Nielson cottage, today so lonely on the
Schuylkill meadow, was one of the earliest places in America where trial
by jury was held. A trail that led to the house from the direction of
Tinicum Island has appeared on the maps of the city from time out of
memory as Jones's Lane. Jonas Niel-son is buried at the Old Swedes
Church cemetery.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By the custom of the Swedes to change their names to the baptismal name
of the father, the progeny of Jonas Nielson became known as Jonasson,
and in the next generation that was Anglicized to Jones. This is
referred to in an old deed of  partition on record at the City Hall,
which mentions William Jones as "a grandson of Jonas Nealson, yeoman,
late of Kingsessing, the said William Jones, having agreeable to the
Swedish custom, changed his surname from Nealson to Jones."
Mounce Jones, son of Jonas Nielson, moved to Amity township, Berks
county, late in the seventeenth century. He built the stone house still
standing at the Douglass-ville bridge, on the old Schuylkill road. It
bears the date "1716." Mounce Jones had a son Jonas, who had a son
Nicholas, who had a son Samuel, who had a son Ezekiel, the father of the
subject of this sketch.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Capt. Richard Hall Jones was born near Douglassville, Berks county, Pa.,
Aug. 22, 1834, and grew to manhood in his native county. From 1851 to
1870 he was engaged in the manufacture of iron tubing in Reading. He
be-came very prominent during the Civil war. In 1862 after Gen. Banks'
retreat, Mr. Jones tendered his services to Governor Curtin, but
additional troops were refused by the Secretary of War at that time.
When the call for nine months men was made, Mr. Jones opened a
re-cruiting office in the Ringgold Armory, and Aug. 1, 1862, he had
succeeded in enlisting 119 men. Acting under or-ders, on Aug. 9, 1862,
he marched his company to Harrisburg, where he remained in camp until
the 17th, when they proceeded to the front in defense of Washington,
camping near Hunter's Chapel, Virginia. They were organized as Company
I, 128th Pa. V. I., and Mr. Jones became captain of the company. On
Sept. 6, 1862, the reg-iment marched from near Fort Woodbury, opposite
Georgetown, D. C., to Rockville, Md., where it was bri-gaded with the
First Division of the Twelfth Army Corps. With this Corps it entered
upon a severe campaign in Maryland, and was engaged in the battles of
South Moun-tain and Antietam, after which it occupied Maryland Heights,
opposite Harper's Ferry, Sept. 20, 1862, and from that time it remained
there until relieved Dec. 11th following. Proceeding at once to Stafford
Court House, Va., it entered upon the Rappahannock campaign. Moving from
Stafford Court House by way of Kelly's Ford, it reached the line of
battle on the right of Chancellor House, April 30, 1863. In the attack
that followed, Captain Jones and thirty-five of his men and Companies C
and K of the same regiment, were captured, and sent to Libby Prison.
Here they suffered all the horrors and privations of that noted pen, and
while there their regi-ment was mustered out by reason of the expiration
of the term of service. As soon as he was released Capt. Jones returned
to his home at Reading, and resumed the occupations of peace. He became
clerk with the Adams Express Company, and remained with that company
un-til he entered the employ of Mr. George W. Hughes, with whom he
remained until the latter's death. Capt. Jones then took charge of the
business and carried it on with great success until his own death. The
firm is now known as Dietrich &amp; Hollenbach. Capt. Jones died Jan. 15,
1899.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Captain Jones was twice married. By his first marriage to Rebecca
Miles, he became the father of two chil-dren: James Miles, who married
Ellen Kinsey Weidner, and has one child, Dorothy M.; and Nathaniel
Wilmer, a train dispatcher between Tamaqua and Williamsport, who married
(first) Hannah Elizabeth Heffner, had one child, Richard A., and married
(second) Ella Stryker. For his second wife Captain Jones married Ellen
E. Hughes, and to this marriage three children were born: Henrietta
Hughes, who married Edward Newton Wigfall, and has one child, E.
Newton, Jr.; Henry Harrison, of Springfield, Ill., superintendent of the
Electric Heat and Power Company, who married Ellen M. Van Duyn, and has
three children, Ellen L. and Catherine E. and Gilbert A. (twins); and
Miss Eleanor A. Mc., at home.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Capt. Jones was prominent in fraternal societies. He was a member of
Lodge No. 62, F. &amp; A. M., in which he was past master; Excelsior
Chapter; Reading Com-mandery; Rajah Temple, A. A. O. N. M. S.; I. O. O.
F.; K. of P.; and the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Loyal Legion of
America. Capt. Jones was one of those men to whom duty is a watchword,
and he was never found wanting in any relation of life. At his death be
had the esteem of all who knew him.

<br><br>
Richmond Legh Jones, Esq., the subject of this biography, was born Feb.
17, 1840, and after a thorough training in the best schools of this
country completed his education at the University of Heidelberg,
Germany. Before entering that world renowned institution; however, he
went to South America with the United States expedition against
Paraguay, visiting the islands of St. Thomas and Barbadoes, in the West
Indies, and the principal cities of the east coast of South America,
and, sailing a thousand miles up the Parana river to Asuncion, was
present at
the capitulation of Lopez, which crowned the success of the expedition.
After a sojourn of several years in Europe, he returned to America and
entered the law office of his father as a student, and having been
thoroughly qualified was admitted to the bar of Berks county, April 14,
1863. He was subsequently admitted to the Supreme court of the
Commonwealth and to the Bar of Philadelphia and other counties of the
State.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In his profession he has attained marked distinction having tried and
won many cases involving important principles of law which are now
widely quoted as precedents, and having recently been appointed, by the
Bar Association of Pennsylvania, chairman of a committee to revise the
corporation laws of the State. The Reading street railway system, with
its suburban adjuncts, and the electric light and gas companies, and
many other industrial corporations which he represents, owe their marked
success largely to the genius and ability displayed by Mr. Jones in
their organization and development. He is general counsel also for the
United Power and Transportation Company and the Interstate Railways
Company, corporations controlling over five hundred miles of street
railways in Pennsylvania and the adjoining States. His services to the
public, aside from business, have been equally notable, and the
prosperous community in which he lives cheerfully acknowledges many
substantial benefits largely due to his well-directed energy and the
wisdom of his counsel. It was mainly through his efforts that the city
of Reading recovered the tract of land, lost for nearly a hundred years,
at the foot of Penn's Mount, now beautifully improved as the City Park
and known as Penn Common; and that the free public library of the city,
of which he is president, was rescued from obscurity and sacrifice,
placed upon an enduring foundation by liberal private contributions
headed with his name, and then adopted by the public as worthy of
maintenance out of the common purse.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1862 on the invasion of Maryland by the Confederate army, Mr. Jones
enlisted, serving as a private soldier, and was present at the battle of
Antietam, and in 1863 he was made captain of a company of Pennsylvania
volunteers. In 1866 he was elected a member of the Legislature from the
county of Berks, and was twice reelected, and in 1868, his second term,
he received his party's nomination for the speakership. His speeches on
the amendments to the Constitution of the United States then being
considered, were widely read, and ranked with the best arguments upon
that subject. He had little taste for politics; however, and a
preference for the work of his profession induced him to retire from
public life. He has since held no public office excepting that of
Commissioner at Valley Forge, to which he was appointed by Governor
Pennypacker and has been reappointed by Governor Stuart.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He is a vestryman of Christ Church, Reading, and a director in many
local organizations. He is also a member of the Colonial Society of
Pennsylvania, Society of Colonial Wars, Sons of the Revolution, Society
of the War of 1812, and Grand Army of the Republic.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On Nov. 26, 1870, he married Margaret Ellen McCarty, daughter of James
McCarty, a prominent ironmaster of Reading, and Rebecca MacVeagh, his
wife, and a niece of Wayne and Franklin MacVeagh. He had one daughter,
now deceased, who was the wife of Nathaniel Ferguson of Reading. His
country residence, "Merioneth." overlooks the city of Reading from the
surrounding hills.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones is descended from a long line of distinguished Colonial and
Revolutionary ancestors on both sides of his house. His father, J.
Glancy Jones, was an able lawyer and distinguished member of Congress
from Berks county from 1850 to 1859, during his last term having been
chairman of the committee on Ways and Means. He resigned his seat in
Congress to accept the appointment of envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary to Austria, which office be held during the trying times
of the commencement of the Civil war, when our relations with foreign
countries were extremely delicate. Mr. Jones's great-grandfather, Col.
Jonathan Jones, was senior captain of the first regiment raised in
Pennsylvania for the Continental army, October 1775. He participated in
the winter campaign for the relief of the army of Quebec, after the
death of Montgomery, and also in many important engagements. For
distinguished services he was promoted to the rank of major, and later
to that of lieutenant-colonel in the Pennsylvania Line.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones's great-great-grandfather, David Jones, came from Merioneth,
Wales, to Pennsylvania in 1721, and bought a large tract of land in
Caernarvon township, where he opened and developed iron ore mines, which
still bear his name.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Jones's mother was the daughter of William Rodman, of Bucks county,
who was a brigade quartermaster in the army of the Revolution, and
afterward a member of the Senate of Pennsylvania and of the Twelfth
Congress of the United States. The Rodman family is one of the oldest in
the New World, having settled in America in the early part of the
seventeenth century and contributed to the Colonies many of their most
distinguished citizens.

William H. Jones, a well known citizen of Douglassville, Amity township,
belongs to the oldest family in Berks county. Before William Penn was
born Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, sent out colonists to the New
World, and in 1643, under Capt. John Printz, three ships came over and
established a settlement on Tinicum Island. The Rev. John Campanius Holm
was pastor for the Colony, and the first church was built by the
government of the mother country. This was a block house, and it stood
on the present site of Old Swedes Church, (erected in 1700), at Swanson
and Christian streets, Philadelphia. Originally the ministers of this
church were Lutheran in faith, but as time passed on and the Swedish
language died out, the congregation elected a minister of the Church of
England, and of that denomination the church has continued. On the flats
west of the Schuylkill, at Philadelphia, is still standing a house built
by Jonas Nielson (tradition says in 1650). Though consisting of but two
tiny rooms and a garret, many
traditions are extant concerning the importance of this place in early
days, and in front of the fireplace George Washington once sat as a
guest. Court was also held there. Jonas Nielson is buried at Old Swedes
Church. By the custom of the Swedes to change their name to the
baptismal name of the father, the progeny of Jonas Nielson became known
as Jonasson , which in the next generation was anglicized to Jones. An
old deed of partition on record at the City Hall, Philadelphia, mentions
