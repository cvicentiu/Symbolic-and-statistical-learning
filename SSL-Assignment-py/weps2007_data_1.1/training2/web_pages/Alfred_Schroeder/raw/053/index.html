      The event is being organized by Molly Peebles, EAA 687879, a Washington State resident who learned how to fly this past year.<br>
      “Last year, we witnessed aviation being used as a tool for incredible destruction,” said Peebles, who noted her check ride was originally scheduled for 9/11/01. “This year, we pilots have an opportunity to reclaim our skies by using aviation as a tool for great inspiration and bringing people together across the country to do something that has never been done before.”<br>

      Flight Operations Curfew at Burbank Airport</font></B><br>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">EAA opposes the city of Burbank, California, and the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena (BUR) Airport Authority attempt to impose an unprecedented 10 p.m.-7 a.m. ban on all airport flight operations for noise reduction purposes. If successful, no flight operations would be allowed during those hours, with a few exceptions including law enforcement and emergency medical operations, and those in violation would be subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.<br>
      FAR Part 161 requires that a benefit cost analysis be conducted before any measure that would restrict aircraft operations is implemented. In Burbank’s case, petitioners need to demonstrate that the benefits of noise abatement will outweigh potential negative economic impact.<br>

Fossett aborted his fifth attempt in the Solo Spirit last year because of severe weather and depleted oxygen supplies. Nevertheless, it was the most successful attempt to date, setting a world record for time aloft, 12 days, 12 hours, and 57 minutes over a distance of more than 12,690 statute miles. A complete journey will take 19 days and cover some 22,000 miles flying at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. Fossett, a member of the EAA President’s Council, will begin his journey the first opportunity on or after June 13, depending on weather conditions.<br>

EAA forwarded about 300 final comments from its members to the FAA on the last weekend before the May 6 deadline, and a similar amount were sent directly to the agency via e-mail.
      The result of this late surge is the DOT Docket Office was
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"> inundated with comments, and not only for sport pilot but for other unrelated NPRM comment periods that closed near the same day.<br>
      “The docket office was swamped with last-minute comments and is feverishly trying to get them all in the system,” said Judy S. Courbois from the FAA Office of Rulemaking. Evidently the office also had some minor problems with the electronic submissions, which they are working on. However, there is no need to re-submit any comments, Courbois stressed. The FAA
      was intending to have all comments that were received by May 6 posted in the docket sometime this week.

      33-hour Simulated Lindbergh Flight Set to Begin Monday Morning<br>
      </B></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Six </font><font face="Arial" size="2">EAA members
      will be cleared and ready for takeoff at 7.52 CDT Monday morning, at EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh,
      Wisconsin, and for the next 33 hours will simulate Charles Lindbergh's
      epic trans-Atlantic flight of 75 years ago. The volunteer pilots will fly
      through the night until about 5.00 p.m. on May 21, approximating Lindbergh time in the air used to fly across the Atlantic.
      The simulation software was specially created by
      <a href="http://www.flight1.com/"> Flight One Software</a> to work with Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2002 and match the flight characteristics of Lindbergh's modified Ryan M-2 monoplane. The volunteers will
      fly across a virtual Atlantic to LeBourget airport outside Paris just as Lindbergh did in 1927.
      Museum visitors will also be able to fly along on a separate simulator
      during regular museum hours.<br>

The book,
      Jonathan Livingston Seagull, sold over 20 million copies in 40 languages and became part of the international literary lexicon.<br>
      Bach, EAA 25906, has written about a dozen books including <i> Stranger To The Ground, A Gift of
      Wings</i>, and <i>Biplane</i>. Aviation and flight, his life’s passions, have always figured prominently in his writing.
      Bach will present his latest works at AirVenture Oshkosh 2002’s Author’s Corner, the first two installments of his anticipated five-book Ferret Chronicles series:
      <i> Rescue Ferrets at Sea </i> and <i> Air Ferrets Aloft</i>.<br>

There is still room, however, for those who want to participate. The mission of POP, brought to you by Cirrus
      Design Corp., is to thank aircraft owners/operators for bringing their special aircraft to AirVenture and to remind visitors to respect the aircraft and surrounding areas by observing Flight Line etiquette, that is: No touching/handling of aircraft except with owner/crew present; no smoking on the flight line or in the vicinity of any aircraft; no smoking inside any AirVenture building/structures; no food or drink within 10 feet of any aircraft; no coolers (except campers with permits); no alcohol; and no pets.

      </B>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Federal Air Surgeon Dr. Jon Jordan recently announced a new policy that allows pilots with certain medical conditions to renew their special issuance medical certificate with their local aviation medical examiners (AMEs), provided they have proper documentation (medical records).
      The new initiative is limited to airmen seeking third class medicals and only applies to 20 specific medical conditions. These conditions are: asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, sleep apnea, history of arterial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lymphoma, prostate cancer, non-physiologic heart murmur, arthritis, colitis, urolithiasis, diet-controlled diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and a history of migraine syndrome.
      Renewals previously required pilots to submit requests to the Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD) in Oklahoma City, often resulting in frustrating delays. EAA’s Aeromedical Council had been a proponent of this policy change for several years through several meetings and work groups. EAA continues to work with FAA to streamline procedures and eliminate roadblocks for obtaining FAA medical certification.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

      Services:<br>
      Under which FARs am I allowed to change the oil and oil filter on my personal plane, a Cessna?<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Answer: </b>14 CFR Part 43 deals with maintenance.  Appendix A of Part 43 lists, in paragraph (c), items which are considered to be "Preventive Maintenance".  The items listed as preventive maintenance can be performed by a person who holds a private pilot certificate or higher, as authorized by Part 43.3, paragraph (g), which states:<br>
      <br>
      "(g) The holder of a pilot certificate issued under Part 61 may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft owned or operated by that pilot which is not used under Part 121, 129, or 135."<br>
      <br>
      The specific listings in Part 43, Appendix A that allow you to change the oil in your personal aircraft are items (6) and (23):<br>
      <br>
      (6) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates, cowlings, and fairings.<br>
      <br>
      (23) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements.<br>
      <br>
      FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-12A offers guidance on preventive maintenance.  Paragraph (4)(g) of this AC specifically states that the above mentioned items authorize you to change the oil and filter of your aircraft (providing you hold a private pilot certificate or higher).<br>
