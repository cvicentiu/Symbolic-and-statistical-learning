Cpl. Alfred Schroeder Writes</B><BR> 
"Just a line to let you know I am now somewhere in Northern Ireland. This is quite some 
country. I have not been out to look around much but from what I have seen so far it is all 
right. <BR> They are only about twenty years behind us. The steering wheel on a car is on the
 right side, and they drive on the left side of the road. Does it ever look funny. <BR> Tell
 everybody hello for me.<BR> 
Cpl. Alfred J. Schroeder.
