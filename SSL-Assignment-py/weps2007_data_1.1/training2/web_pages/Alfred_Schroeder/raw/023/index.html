															<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Another case of selective recall about antioxidants came up last week in the medical community. This time the statement came from the American Heart Association (AHA).<br />
<br />
"Research fails to justify routine use of antioxidant supplements to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease," read a science advisory from the AHA. However it was noted that they only reviewed some studies over a limited period of time from 1995 to 2001. Even then it did not note that they considered all studies in those few years.<br />
<br />
Even so, at the end of the AHA press release it noted five studies that showed beneficial effects.<br />
<br />
Other studies both immediately prior to and following the few years noted by the AHA release directly contradicted their "routine use of antioxidant supplements to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease" statement.<br />
<br />
More selective recall<br />
<br />
The AHA statement also concentrated on the better known but lesser strength antioxidants of beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E. There was no mention of lesser known but greater strength antioxidants such as selenium.<br />
<br />
It would also be a safe bet that less expensive, man-made, synthetic supplements were utilized as usual in the unfavorable studies rather than nutrients from foods.<br />
<br />
Honesty the best policy?<br />
<br />
These kinds of less than honest policy statements have been routine at the AHA for many decades.<br />
<br />
Almost 40 years ago Dr. Henry Alfred Schroeder (of Yale, Columbia and Dartmouth universities) was their keynote speaker at the AHA George Brown Memorial Lecture and received many accolades. He developed the low salt diet for hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease, and developed the first hypertension drug treatment.<br />
<br />
Shortly thereafter Dr. Schroeder discovered that it was not the sodium of salt that was the problem but rather that salt was a carrier of the heavy metal cadmium.<br />
<br />
The AHA ignored that more recent finding of Schroeder.<br />
<br />
Selenium is the only element that removes cadmium. Selenium has also been shown for decades to be a preventative for heart disease. No naturally occurring element is a greater antioxidant, yet the AHA is ignoring that antioxidant in their recent ANTI-antioxidant pronouncement.<br />
<br />
Yet a little later Dr. Schroeder revealed that cholesterol was not the culprit it was made out to be regarding heart disease. He announced that chromium managed cholesterol. In the absence of chromium then cholesterol would be out of control. Schroeder determined through extensive animal and human studies that chromium deficiency was a primary cause of heart disease.<br />
<br />
The AHA also ignored that later finding of Schroeder and has continued in that ignorance for more than 30 years.<br />
<br />
Chromium also has its greatest action as part of the Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) molecule. GTF also happens to be an antioxidant. GTF happens to be an antioxidant also absent from mention in the AHA policy statement against antioxidant supplements.<br />
<br />
For decades heart disease has been unchallenged as the number one killer of both men and women. How much longer shall people continue to suffer and die in such great numbers with so much research for so long about antioxidants against heart disease?<br />
<br />
Should the AHA be renamed the American Hurt Association?<br />
