BETSY GILLIAT<br>
JOHN HENRY GILLIAT 1807–1873<br>
<br>
Thomas was born 1765 at Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire, the fourth son of William and Elizabeth. There was a sister ANNE GILLIAT 1763-1850 born between he and his older brother John. Anne was to marry WILLIAM LONGSTAFF.<br>
<br>
Thomas was four years younger than his brother John but there was obviously a good relationship between the two. It is not known if they went together to Virginia or Thomas followed at a later date but it is known that they set up business in Richmond around 1788 as “British Merchants”, trading in tobacco, cotton and sundries. They opened an establishment in Richmond where they sold imported goods from England. It was customary to extend credit to planters for them to purchase merchandise and also to accept payment in tobacco, cotton or such produce. In fact this was often convenient as coinage was very scarce and gold and silver coins were often cut in pieces so as to make smaller payments. This coined the phrase “two bits”. <br>
<br>
<br>
From one who visited the city thus describes Richmond in 1789:-<br>
<br>
“It contains about 300 houses. The new houses are well built. A large and elegant state house or capitol has lately been erected on the hill. The lower part of the town is divided by a creek, over which there is a bridge, which for Virginia is elegant. A handsome and expensive bridge, between 300 and 400 yards in length, has lately been thrown across the James River at the foot of the falls by Col. John Mayo, a respectable and wealthy planter, whose seat is about one mile from Richmond. The bridge connects Richmond and Manchester, and as the passengers pay toll it produces handsome revenue to Col. Mayo, who is the sole proprietor. The falls above the bridge are seven miles in length. A canal is being cut on the north side of the river, which is to terminate in a basin of about two acres in the Town of Richmond. The opening of this canal promises the addition of much wealth to Richmond.”<br>
<br>
The population was around 3000 people and almost half of those were slaves. The population in 1800 had grown to 5,735 still half of whom were slaves.  There were numerous inns as the stature of the now capital city drew constant visitors and conventions. However, it was a small community and it would have been hard not to know most of the free inhabitants if one lived in the town for any length of time. <br>
<br>
The first record of the Gilliat brothers residence is a petition to the Governor for land that was recorded in 1787. In June 1788 the brothers had an advertisement in the Virginia Independent Chronicle requesting for anyone with information as to a parcel of calico, which had been stolen from the Gilliat Brothers store in Richmond.<br>
<br>
In 1789 Thomas married Mary Scott of Harris County she was fifteen years old. She had two sisters who apparently also came to live with the Gilliats. <br>
<br>
The following year a landmark court case was recorded in Augusta County between John and Thomas Gilliat and Mustoe and Chambers who apparently owed the brothers the princely sum of £378. copies of  the papers are attached.<br>
<br>
The business flourished and around 1890 John left for London leaving Thomas in charge of the American side of the operation.<br>
<br>
Thomas and Mary had two children the second of which died in infancy. <br>
<br>
<b>ALFRED GALLEGO GILLIAT (1800-1859)</b> born in 1800 and, as was often the custom of the times, he bore the name of a good and trusted friend of the family. Joseph Gallego was Spanish, and such a friend; very influential in Richmond, he was a founder of the Bank of Virginia and the proprietor of the Gallego flourmills that were the pride of Richmond and all Virginia and exported their famous flour around the world. Joseph Gallego was a business partner with Thomas in a coalmine and was an executor of his estate. <br>
<br>
William Gilliat was their second son and he died at birth. Mary died in 1803 from a horse riding accident and was buried alongside William at the St. Johns Church in Richmond. She also left behind her Sarah and Sophia her two sisters who seemed to have been very much a part of the family. In Thomas’s will they received a very generous bequest that assured that they would be cared for until they were married. Sarah Scott eventually married William Gray, the British Consul in Norfolk VA. Their son was christened Alfred Gilliat Gray  (1818-1876) and he distinguished himself in the Texas and Confederate navies. (See attached) Mary Gilliat Gray (1811-1883) was a daughter of Sarah Scott and she became the wife of John Harris who also was a distinguished and decorated member of the US navy and a Colonel in the US Marine corps seeing action in the Seminole war and the Mexican war (also attached).<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that the position and respect held by Thomas in Richmond was quite notable. He was however, an Englishmen, and a “British Trader” (British Traders were held with suspicion because of charges of usury and as many plantation owners owed large sums of money to them they were often disliked).  As such he obviously chose to take a low profile, especially in the hot bed of American politics that thrived in the new capitol of Richmond. Although there seems to be no doubt as to his connections and behind the scenes influence. <br>
<br>
Some indication of his status in the community can be gauged by the following report of his residence:-These are excerpts from “Richmond in By–Gone Days “ by Samuel Morecai:<br>
<br>
<br>
“The only house on Ross Street stood nearly opposite to the Council Chamber and had no claim to antiquity, but it excited admiration by the beauty of it’s elevated position and it’s Italian aspect. A center building with wings, and a portico in the rear fronting the river displayed an arcade in the entire length of the edifice, commanding an extensive view of the city beneath, of the country around, of the river, it’s islands and it’s falls and it’s smooth water; with the sails of vessels glancing through the trees in the sinuosities of the stream; of the yellow fields of wheat and green fields of corn, with a background of forest, all changing their dresses with the changes of the seasons; these combined to form an exquisite landscape. The residence here mentioned coated in white, embosomed amid tall Lombardy poplars, and the hillside terraced as far down as Franklin Street, presented a charming aspect from the city below. The first occupant of this spot that I remember was James Strange, a Scotch merchant, but an American citizen, with a majestic Virginian wife. Their son was a conspicuous man in public life in North Carolina. Their successor was Thomas Gilliat, an English merchant, whose wife and sisters rendered the spot more attractive; one of them has long graced the society of Norfolk.”<br>
<br>
A later occupant was Joseph Marx, in his absence the whole establishment was consumed by fire. A view of Richmond taken in 1807 is given as an embellishment to Bishop Madison’s “Map of Virginia”. In that picture this house and garden are conspicuous as are the Council Chamber, Harris’ tall house and various other objects recorded in these pages.<br>
<br>
[I found the following on the Library of Congress online catalog and have since obtained a copy of the said “embellishment” the two drawings above are of the whole and an enlarged  section which shows the house with the terraces and the Lombardy poplars.<br>

Excerpt from “Poe’s Richmond” by Agnes M Bondurant.<br>
<br>
“Regardless of the family troubles it appears that Mr. And Mrs. Allan (Foster Parents of Edgar Allan Poe) were now going in the best Richmond society. Their neighbors included Thomas Taylor, whose daughter William Galt married; Joseph Tate, one time mayor of the city; Major James Gibbon, Joseph Marx and Thomas Gilliat. “These gentlemen were of the highest social position in Richmond,” and were associates of Chief Justice Marshall, Colonel Ambler, Dr. Brockenbrough, Judge Cabell, Judge Stanard, and others famous for good dinners and whist parties.”<br>
<br>
More Excerpts from “Richmond in Bygone  Days” by Samuel Mordecai<br>
<br>
The worthies of Richmond of the last century formed among themselves three associations, for very different purposes – charitable, literary and sociable –in which order I shall introduce them.<br>
<br>
The AMICABLE SOCIETY was instituted in 1788, with the benevolent object of relieving strangers and wayfarers, in distress, for whom the law makes no provision.<br>
<br>
The membership was limited to sixty members – Thos. Gilliat was admitted in 1791. and in 1813.  W. Gilliat (Thomas’s nephew) was admitted.<br>
<br>
THE LIBRARY SOCIETY under the management of the founders who embraced most of the persons constituting the Amicable Society was as well conducted as such establishments usually are. Apparently its failure in later days can be attributed to some lady novel readers who induced the directors to fill the shelves with “Minerva Library” novels noted for cheap trash that offended some of the members and led to the demise of the Society.<br>
<br>
THE BARBACUE CLUB (spelling is as recorded) or the Quoit Club also consisted of those same members of the Amicable Club but they met on Saturday mornings. “The exercise and recreation, bodily and mental, at the close of the weeks labors, were most grateful and invigorating, and the social intercourse was promotive of good fellowship. Respectable strangers, and more especially foreigners who were invited to the barbacue, as the feast was called, could hear see Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, without licentiousness, presumption or demagoguism, and pure Republicanism, represented by some of the most distinguished men, who aided in forming the republic.”<br>
<br>
I am not aware but this could have been the birth of the BARBECUE as we know it today.<br>
<br>
Thomas belonged to the congregation of St. Johns Church and it was there that his first wife Mary and son William were buried and where her gravestone is still evident and readable. It was a congregation of historic people and the place where Patrick Henry gave forth with his famous lines “give me liberty or give me death”. Later years the Monumental church Protestant Episcopalian, was erected on the site of the old theatre fire to commemorate the seventy-two people killed in a most disastrous conflagration. Many of the casualties were the leaders in the Richmond society. A group of leading citizens, including the estate of Thos. Gilliat, subscribed  each to the building fund of the new church and memorial.<br>
<br>
In 1805 Thomas married a second time, his new bride was MARTHA COWCHER (B. 1785) (She was listed as age 27 and a British alien in the 1812 census, and as a recent immigrant from Britain in 1806. (This would suggest that Thomas had returned to England to get his second bride). They had a daughter born in 1806 who did not survive and a son JOHN HENRY GILLIAT (1807-1873) who was born in 1807. <br>
<br>
Thomas died at 45 years while visiting New York in 1810. (It is said that he was on his way to London when he was overcome) The Norfolk, Virginia Gazette published – “Died yesterday at the house of Mrs. Kinsey, No 5, Broadway, N.Y. Mr. Thomas Gilliat of Richmond VA, in the 47th year of his life. A native of England, he has lived for many years in Richmond.<br>
<br>
Many records were destroyed during the fires and mayhem of the American Civil War resulting in a great loss of recorded history and it is very difficult to get a complete record of almost any subject. Thomas Gilliat was said to have been the largest exporter of tobacco in Virginia in the late 1700 – early 1800 period. He was a merchant / importer and advertised in partnership with his brother John in the Richmond newspapers. He owned lots, houses and warehouses in Richmond, one third of a coalmine in Henrico County, a plantation in Amherst County, and various substantial parcels of land throughout the Richmond area. He had various partnerships and joint ventures such as Gilliat and Taylor, Gilliat and Mackinder of Norfolk VA., and Gilliat and Kirby. For all the destruction of data there remains numerous items in the records of Thomas doing business. One in particular is a comment by a ship owner who had difficulty with the honesty of some of the shippers and traders in the area. It appears that he was introduced by his broker to Thomas Gilliat who was looking for space on the ships. The man wrote a very complementary report as to the honesty of Thomas and his fair dealings.<br>
<br>
I have placed a section on AMERICAN BUSINESS under John Gilliat and much of it is also applicable to Thomas who, I believe, probably contributed as much or more to the fortunes and the dynasty of the London Gilliats. <br>
<br>
His will stipulated that his second wife was to receive the Manor House in Richmond, a surrey, team of horses, five slaves and 10,000 pounds sterling. His sons were to receive the balance with his brother John in London and his friend Joseph Gallego of Richmond being appointed their guardians. Martha C. Gilliat filed suit in court in Richmond shortly after Thomas’s death, requesting everything he owned. The case was in court for years. Apparently she got a major part of the estate since she took the two sons and established residence in Newport Rhode Island, which, at the time, was a resort area for the very wealthy. Some proof of the struggle over the guardianship of the children is on record as I found in the Archives of Maryland (Volume 0194, Page 638) what appears to be “Case Law” which discusses the legality of appointing guardians. It quotes Gilliat vs Gilliat. (3 Phillim. 222,) and that probate to a will appointing a testamentary guardian was considered unnecessary.  <br>
<br>
In 1844, some thirty-four years after his death, wrangling over the assets were still in the courts. A tract of land some 15,342 acres patented to T. Gilliat in 1796 was sold for  and other valuable considerations. <br>
<br>
Not too much is known about the early days of the two boys Alfred and John Henry however, they were very well educated and they seemed to have traveled to Europe a few times including Paris where they had their portraits painted. They appear to have been well provided for despite the wrangling within the family.<br>

Alfred Gallego appears to have found England a place to make his home. The bitter custody law suite could not have been all to his liking and he took up permanent residence in England where he married his cousin Caroline Gilliat (1803-1832) daughter of John and settled in Southampton where they had a son Alfred and a daughter Caroline Emma <br>
<br>
It is of little use speculating what was really going on between Martha Gilliat and the rest of the family but the boys seemed to have had no problem with the rest of the Gilliat family. As can be seen Alfred being independent, found a home in England and married into his Uncle John’s family.  John Henry meanwhile, while still a teenager, formed a company with cousin William Henry Gilliat (son of Richard Gilliat), who had taken over the Gilliat interests in Richmond after the death of Thomas. Jane Gilliat Fry who is the last known surviving descendent of John Henry to be born with the Gilliat name told me that very little was known about her families beginnings other than they were thought to have been rich and owned ships but had lost everything due to piracy. Again the old family stories still have the ring of truth to them. The seas were very insecure during the early 1800s and French Privateers preyed on the trade lanes between the Americas and Britain. There is some evidence that the Gilliat companies lost considerable merchandise to pirates and there is evidence of claims for compensation etc. through the courts. <br>
<br>
<br>
U.S.SUPREME COURT<br>
US v. GILLIAT 164 U.S.42 (1896)<br>
UNITED STATES<br>
VS<br>
GILLIAT No. 535.<br>
October 26, 1896<br>
<br>
<br>
The above case is recorded under Laws: Case and Codes: Supreme Court Opinions. This is one of the claims originating in the depredations committed by French cruises upon the commerce of American citizens prior to the year 1800, commonly called the “French Spoliation Claims”. The case was in regards to a claim made by “Gilliat and Taylor’ under the provisions of the act and referred to the losses “On the ship Hannah, Richard Fryer, Master, namely, …to John A. Brimmer, administrator of John Gilliat, deceased, ,840.44”. There seems to have been some question as to the legality of the original petitioner as the Act had been amended to allow claims to be paid to the next of kin of the sufferers. Charles G. Gilliat the appellant presented his petition to the court of claims for the payment off one third of the sum named. On the ground that he was a grandson of one of the original sufferers by reason of the seizure of the ship Hannah, above mentioned and had been duly appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate of his grandfather by the chancery court of the city of Richmond and State of Virginia. The state appealed the petition but –Upon the hearing, the court of claims decided that the petitioner was the administrator of the estate of Thomas Gilliat, who was one of the three members of the firm of Gilliat and Taylor, the original sufferers, and the petitioner represented the descendents and the next of kin of the above mentioned Thomas Gilliat; and the court certified to the secretary of the treasury for payment – one third of the sum of ,840.44, appropriated by the act of March 3rd 1891, being the sum of ,946.81, which was the extent of the interest of Thomas Gilliat in the Partnership of Gilliat and Taylor.   ( I believe that the Charles G. Gilliat mentioned would have been Charles Chequiere Gilliat the son of John Henry, and the grandson of Thomas.)<br>
In a note from Mac Gilliat presently of Texas he recalls his grandfather Alfred Gordon Gilliat (1860-1936) told of receiving a notice from someone in England, via someone in Virginia, that we were probably heir to a claim of this type (French Spoliation Claim). We believe that he answered this, but to our knowledge, he received nothing from this claim. He was asked to provide some kind of proof and what he used, I do not know.<br>

There is some confusion as to the life of young Alfred who married twice. It is clear that he married an Anne Taddy Hatfield of whom he speaks so fondly in is will, she was a close relative of Elizabeth (Daughter of John Gilliat ) and Alex Hatfield. Alfred moved from Southampton to Twickenham but he died while at Dinard, France, a resort on the coast near the Channel Islands and popular with the social elite of the day. He had numerous children and his first son ALFRED GORDON GILLIAT moved to Texas in 1878. Where his descendents still reside. It is a curiosity that Alfred Gordon ranched in Bourne TX. At the same time several of Thomas Hughes’ nephews were also ranching in the area, perhaps showing some connections that found Hughes and Gilliat folk in both Bourne and Rugby.<br>

“Mac” Alfred McDonald Gilliat  lives in Leakey, Texas and his first cousin Elizabeth Gray Hudson lives in Bourne, Texas. I believe that “Mac” Gilliat was granted the title of Emeritus and quoting from the records :- “In recognition of his long and distinguished service to the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, the title of County Extension Agent Emeritus is conferred upon Alfred “Mac” Gilliat, Jr., and he is granted all rights and privileges of this title, effective October 13, 1995.” On motion of Mr. McClure, seconded  Mr. O’Connor, and by unanimous vote”.<br>
There are also a number of published papers on agricultural subjects, some of which can be found on the Internet written by Mac Gilliat. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2ND GEN. JOHN HENRY GILLIAT</b> was not too badly off and he seems to have been a well-respected merchant. There has been some confusion as to his career as he has gone down in history as an Episcopalian minister however; he was not ordained until he was sixty years old, almost in his retirement. He was only three years old when his father died and it is believed his youth was spent with his mother, mostly in Rhode Island at a resort frequented by the more affluent society of the Americas. <br>
<br>
In 1823 a new company was formed between William Henry son of Richard Gilliat and his first cousin John Henry.  Whether the Company was doing business in the Richmond area for the different Gilliats, or just for the two principals is not known at this time but could be researched. William Henry was representing the J. K.Gilliat company in London but it would seem that over the years he was also doing business on his own behalf including the venture with John Henry.  It is known that different London Gilliats spent time in Richmond as representatives of the J.K.G companies and themselves. There is a record in the “Schroeder files” of John Henry doing business with their family but to what extent it is not yet known. It is known that he married SUSAN SCHROEDER on November 23rd 1831 at Trinity Church, Newport, Rhode Island.<br>
<br>
The Schroeder’s were an influential family and their very informative “Bicentennial Family History” spells out in detail the events of their family over the years. (I first came across the Schroeder connection when I visited the LDS library in Salt Lake City. I wrote and contacted – Mrs. George S Horton - from whom I purchased a number of the Schroeder Family History books and she graciously put me in touch with Jane Gilliat Fry, who was then living in upstate New York. Jane was a delightful lady and we exchanged correspondence for some years. Coincidentally we both suffered through a bout of the same kind of cancer and came through remarkably well. Unfortunately Jane has not withstood age so well and is presently suffering from Alzheimer’s. I regret that I never was able to meet Jane in person. From her correspondence she left me with an impression of someone with such a bubbly and friendly personality). <br>
<br>
<b>2ND GEN. SUSAN SCHROEDER (1812-1846)</b> born on May 9 1812 at 6 a.m. the first daughter and second child of Valentine Henry Schroeder (1787-1870) and Henrietta Maria Ghequiere (1790-1877). The Rev. Dr. Bend baptized her on June 6th. 1812 her uncle William Schroeder and her mother were sponsors. She was apparently a very pretty lady according to her portraits, which are held by Mrs. Jane Gilliat Fry. Her marriage to John Henry Gilliat on November 23rd. 1831 took place at Trinity Church, Newport, Rhode Island, the Rev. Mr. Wheaton officiating. <br>
<br>

The poor lady Susan, succumbed at the age of 38, on October 31st 1846, at Burlington, New Jersey. <br>
A letter written to the Rev. Francis Gilliat contains the following vignette about her, which is most descriptive:<br>
<br>
“As to your dear Mother, my recollections are very slight. I was but a little boy – I suppose some six or seven years old – when she visited my father’s house near Pittsburgh. Besides her graceful face and graceful figure and spirited bearing, what struck me most - being new to me – was her playing on the guitar. I was already familiar with the piano, the organ, and the harp, as played by my parents and my older sisters; but the guitar was new. And your mother not only played but sang to it! And there was one song in which, at a certain place, she thumped the guitar with her finger ends, beating it like a drum; and that filled my soul with rapture.”<br>
<br>

<b>HISTORICAL NOTES OF MEMBERS OF THE THOMAS GILLIAT FAMILY</b><br>
<br>
History of the Church Of The Holy Cross. Nr. Portsmouth Rhode Island. John Henry Gilliat has been recorded in history as a clergyman; in fact he was in his sixties before he was ordained in the church. However, the church was a chosen vocation for others in his family and also among his wife’s family the Schroeders. <br>
<br>
An article written by Nancy C. Chase entitled History of Holy Cross Church begins- “The Church of the Holy Cross had its beginnings specifically with two people, Miss Sarah Gibbs and John Henry Gilliat. Apparently John Henry donated the land in April, 1845 as well as a substantial gift toward the building of the church in the same year. A granite stone bears his name in recognition of his generosity.<br>
<br>
From The History of St. James Episcopal Church Arlington.<br>
<br>
On January seventeenth, 1884, the Vestry extended a call to the Rev. Francis Gilliat, of Lowell, Massachusetts to become Rector of the parish. The call was accepted and Mr. Gilliat is remembered by many in the parish as a faithful priest. He and his wife endeared themselves to the parishioners by planning frequently for social activities at the rectory.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Gilliat is now living in Detroit at the age of seventy six, and in a letter recently received she says: “It was indeed a surprise and a real pleasure to receive your letter recently containing inquiries about my husband, Francis Gilliat. – It is nearly fourty years since Dr. Gilliat died and for twenty five years I have lived with my daughter Mrs. Paul Wheeler Thompson here in Detroit. My elder son John Henry Gilliat was born in Arlington and is now a dentist living at 2164 Bailey Avenue, Buffalo, New York. My second son Robert Fulton Gilliat was born in Fulton, Florida and died in Buffalo twenty six years ago.”<br>
<br>
The records enclosed recorded – Francis graduated from Berkeley Divinity School, Middletown Connecticut, with the degree of Batchelor of Divinity. The Right Rev. John Williams, DD, Assistant Bishop of Connecticut ordained Mr. Gilliat to the Diaconate on May 25th, 1864, in the Church of the Holy Trinity, at Middletown and on October the ninth he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Williams in St. Luke’s Chapel, Middletown. His first call was as assistant to the Rev. D. F. Banks, Rector of Christ Church, Norwich, Connecticut, where he remained for one year. He then accepted a call to South Adams, Mass. October eleventh 1868. In 1872 Mr. Gilliat resigned the rector ship of this parish and became the rector Of Zion Church, Avon, New York, November twenty second 1872. In January 1881 he accepted a call to the rectorship of Grace Church, Washington, D.C. and from there he went to Lowell, Mass. On October twenty-fourth 1882, to be the Assistant to the Reverend Dr. Edson. From Lowell, Mass. He was called on January seventeenth, 1884 to St. James Church. Arlington Vermont. With charge of Zion Church, Factory Point. In the spring of 1886he resigned the rectorship of Arlington and on July 1st 1886, took charge of Grace Mission, Everett, Mass. In January 1888 he became rector of the Church Of The Redeemer, Addison, New York. And in1891 he was called to be Rector of Trinity Church, Conestoga, New York.<br>
<br>
His last parish was St. John’s Church, Ellicotteville, New York, where he went in1898. On December seventh 1900, he died in St. John’s Rectory.<br>
<br>
<b>SCHROEDER PAPERS MS. 2294</b> (in the MARYLAND HISTORICAL SOCIETY LIBRARY)<br>
<br>
I have only seen that there are such papers in the above library and they contain recods and data of some of the business dealings between the Schroeders and the son in law John Henry Gilliat. The records were donated by Gilliat Schroeder. Gilliat was a well used Christian name in the Schroder family. It would be of interest to do the search.<br>
<br>
<b>VIRGINIA LIBRARY OBITUARIES</b><br>
<br>
Norfolk Gazette Wed July 11, 1810- Died- yesterday at the house of Mrs. Kinsey, No 5, Broadway, New York. Mr. Thomas Gilliat, of Richmond Va., in the 47th year of his age. A native of England, he had lived for many years in Richmond. (p.3, c. 4)<br>
<br>
NOTES: <br>
<br>
Sarah Scott was the sister of Mary who married Thomas Gilliat. The situation is not clear but it appears that she and her sister both lived with Thomas and Mary and were both left a generous amount of money in Thomas’s will. <br>
