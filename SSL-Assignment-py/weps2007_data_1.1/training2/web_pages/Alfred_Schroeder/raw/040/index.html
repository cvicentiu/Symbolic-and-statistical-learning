<H1>The fiery indignation of God Almighty against Richard Holmes, the late Chief Justice of Kansas
</H1>

"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
(Heb. 10:26,27)

<H2>WBC members will rise up and give testimony against Holmes in the Great Judgment Day of God
</H2>

Yes, Mr. Justice Holmes, when he held temporary power over the lives, fortunes, reputations, and happiness of his fellow creatures, prostituted that power corruptly to Satan’s cause, and lifted up his hand against the Lord’s people. They asked for no favors -- only that he do justice. Holmes deliberately -- in the cold light of day, and with full knowledge of his sins in the doing of it -- did injustice. It is not well with him now.

<H3>Mr. Justice Holmes mocked God & His Word
</H3>

Even after his retirement from the bench, Holmes angrily accosted the humble members of Westboro Baptist Church on the sidewalk outside Topeka Bible Church because he did not like WBC’s anti-gay Gospel message. The Lord Jesus Christ evidently had judges like Homes in mind when He said, "There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man." Lk. 18:2. Holmes must now answer to that God. 

<H3>His crooked fellow judges can’t help him now

This evil man -- Richard W. Holmes -- is now in a jurisdiction where the encomiums of his fellow judicial perverts will have a negative effect. Holmes is now in Hell with Herod, Harold Fatzer, Alfred Schroeder, Earl O’Connor, et al. He will soon be joined in Hell by David Prager, Richard Rogers, Mike Barbara, Robert Miller, Harold Herd & Sam Crow (the last two being devoted patrons of the Bloody Vintage), et al.
