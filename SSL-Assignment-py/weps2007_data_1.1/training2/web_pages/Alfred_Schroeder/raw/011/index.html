<u>Speaker Introduction</u> ....................
</p>
<p>
Charles W. Hodde was appointed by Governor Dixy Lee Ray as the Director of the Department of Revenue on January 12, 1977.    He has served in a wide variety of legislative, state and federal administrative positions over a period of more than 40 years, this being his third period of service in the state's principal revenue agency.
</p>
<p>
From 1936-1951 he was a member of the House of Representatives and served as Speaker of the House in the 1949 and 1951 sessions. He was appointed to the State Tax Commission in 1957 by Governor Albert Rosellini.    From 1959-1961 he was Director of    the Department of General Administration, returning to the State Tax Commission in 1961 and serving as its chairman until January, 1965. He also was a member of the State Toll Bridge Authority.
</p>
<p>
After leaving state service, he became Pacific Northwest Regional Coordinator for the U.S. Department of Interior.    He was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson as the first chairman of the first River Basin Commission established under the National Water Resources Act during the Johnson administration.
</p>
<p>
Hodde formerly lived at Colville where he owned and operated a farming enterprise raising certified seed potatoes, fruit and cattle.    He also owned and operated an electrical contracting business and engaged in logging. He was president of a Farmers' Mutual Power Company organized to furnish power to rural areas before the advent of the R.E.A.    He served on state advisory committees to the Farmers Home Administration and the Colville National Forest.
</p>
<p>
Hodde has served as a state officer in the Washington State Grange on three occasions; first, as its chief education officer from 1933 to 1937. From 1970 until his appointment as Revenue Director in January 1977, he worked as a consultant on tax and natural resources legislation.
</p>
<p>
He has held office in and continues to actively support various service clubs in the area including the Olympia Area Chamber of Commerce.
</p>
<p>
In addition to his duties as Director of Revenue, Hodde is on the Executive Committee of the    National    Association    of    Tax Administrators,    the    Western    States    Association    of    Tax Administrators, and the National Tax Association-Tax Institute of America.

<p>
<u>Personality Corner</u> .....................
</p>
<p>
Our profile of the month is Jim Cleghorn, manager    for    the    Office    of    Financial Management's data processing section.
</p>
<p>
Jim was born in Kansas and during his early years he moved a great deal since his dad was in the Marines. When Jim was in junior high his mother remarried and the folks settled in San Diego where they went into the restaurant business. This assured Jim of a job through junior high and high school. He feels it was good training even if it was a form of slavery. Those long hours kept him out of trouble.
</p>
<p>
After high school, Jim entered college in San Diego as a pre-med student. He quickly decided that he didn't have the money to complete a medical degree and he left school to go to work. Jim has gone to college part time for the last 20 years and graduated from the Evergreen State College this last June. His major emphasis was in management and organizational behavior.
</p>
<p>
Jim's first job, after the restaurant, was for Convair in the aerospace industry. He began as a messenger delivering such things as blueprints and tab cards.    Shortly, people in the tabulating shop offered him a job. Thus Jim's data processing career began.    Later, programmer aptitude tests were given and Jim found himself programming one of IBM's first large scale business computers, the 705.    Jim stayed with Convair for approximately two years.
</p>
<p>He then went to Rohr Corporation, also in aerospace, to program the IBM 650. However, shortly after he arrived, the company upgraded its equipment to a Univac Solid State 80. Here Jim became involved in various business applications.    After two years with Rohr, Jim decided to leave aircraft related industry because of its unstable employment patterns.    This was a wise move, since the next year saw a drastic drop in employment in that field.
</p>
<p>
In 1961, Jim joined Honeywell as a pre-sales systems representative and was transferred from San Diego to Los Angeles. He spent three years in systems work and two as a quota salesperson. He really enjoyed marketing, since the pay is based upon the individual's contribution. However, when a management change occurred in Honeywell, Jim felt it was time to move.    His next employer was Collins Radio, a leader in communications. There he spent a year programming software for CRT's and for several message switching systems.
</p>
<p>
About this time the State of Washington began the data processing coordination program and an intensive recruiting activity. Thus, Jim joined Washington State government in 1967 as a member of the Data Processing Coordinator's staff in the Central Budget Agency (now OFM).    During his first year with the state, he was loaned to the State Patrol to complete the Crime Information Center system plan. This project was completed in September of 1968.
</p>
<p>
When Jim returned to OFM, he managed the Administrative Information System (AIS) group for two years. The Personnel and Purchasing portions of this statewide system were developed, implemented and then turned over to the host agencies to operate and maintain. With the completion of all the systems, AIS was restructured and Jim moved to the State Patrol as their data processing manager. He was with the Patrol for three years. While he was there, they completed the installation of the Crime Information Center. He was also instrumental in installing the automated ACCESS message switching system which provides information to local law enforcement agencies.
</p>
<p>
Next Jim went to the Law and Justice Planning Office where he oversaw the spending of LEAA funds for automated elements of the criminal justice system.
</p>
<p>
Three years later, Jim returned to OFM where he is now. He is working for Joe Noegel and managing data processing.
</p>
<p>
Jim has been with the State for eleven years and he says it "...hardly seems possible." His long range plans include getting his CPA certificate and his doctorate in Systems Science. Eventually he would also like to return to marketing or to establish his own consulting business. Jim feels his greatest accomplishments include his part in    the development    and implementation of the Crime Information Center and AIS.
</p>
<p>
In his spare time Jim enjoys remodeling houses. He has worked on his current house for nine years and he'll "...finish it some day."    He also enjoys archery with his sons. They go deer and elk hunting with a bow whenever they get the opportunity.    Jim has four teenagers; two boys and two girls. The eldest girl just graduated from Capital High School and the other three are attending there this year. Jim's wife, Peggy, is a beautician for Hair West.

<u>DPPD Announces Fall Quarter Courses</u> .............
</p>
<p>
In early June the Data Processing Personnel Development (DPPD) Program assessed the technical training needs of the data processing community and surveyed the opinions of a randomly selected group of data processing staff about key training issues.    The results of both the Data Processing Technical Training Needs Survey and the    Data Processing    Planning Questionnaire helped to determine the direction of the DPPD program for FY 1979.
</p>
<p>
The fall schedule is a full one with a range of offerings varied in length (1 to 5 days), format (workshop, panel discussion, classroom instruction) and focus (systems design, programming, operations, management, and user).

CANARY
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, Reeves received a package of employment application forms from Astrochem. The forms themselves were quite standard-personal statistics, education, experience, references--except for one. That form required the job candidate to provide a "Social Biography" which particularly requested information on parents, relatives, and peers and "their effect on the applicant's professional development." Reeves supposed that Astrochem has some classified government projects and that they would use the social biography to do a background check on him. Let them. He didn't have much background. He had no family, except for the aunts and uncles who had raised him after his parents died, and he hadn't seen those relatives, who had begrudged him every bite and hand-me-down, in years. No close friends came to mind, although he listed his old college coach with whom he still exchanged Christmas cards. When he saw how little he had really been thus far in his life, it left him deeply melancholy.    "What company would hire such a loser?" he thought, almost throwing away the completed forms. But then he didn't; he neatly folded the forms into the return envelope provided by Astrochem and, without the slightest trace of assurance, mailed the package back.
</p>
<p>
The following Tuesday a stiffly formal letter arrived from a Dr. Alfred Schroeder, Chief of Chemical Engineering for Astrochem. Millie was scheduled for a personal interview on Saturday morning, "in order that there be no conflict with your current employment."     Just getting an appointment gave his self-confidence a substantial boost. Maybe there was a place for a nobody in this world, he hoped; possibly he at last had a shot at being the somebody he could have been playing football.    His chest was filled with fluttering anticipation that Saturday at 9:55 in the morning as he steered his sleek Porsche into a visitor's parking slot in front of the Astrochem plant. He would arrive in Schroeder's office very punctually, at precisely ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>
Alfred Schroeder had been a chemist for Astrochem from the time of its founding nearly twenty years before.    The German-born scientist first gained worldwide recognition with the invention of a new process for growing silicon ribbons and had gone on from there to score numerous technological triumphs for Astrochem, and himself. His latest achievement was the development of an ultralight, high-temperature malleable plastic with the strength of steel. The potential of the product was enormous, from airframes to car bodies, and even as a substitute for steel in the construction of buildings.    What made the product even more impressive was that it could be fabricated in a totally automated production plant. All that human workers had to do was feed in the raw materials and haul away the finished goods. No one was even required inside the plant except for a process controller, who checked a few dials and gauges. Not even that human was really necessary; computers controlled every step of the process; but then, one can never completely rely on computers.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Millie Reeves, Dr. Schroeder was not a particularly warm man. After the formality of the letter, Reeves hadn't really expected him to be. Still, the interview was considerably more impersonal than Reeves would have liked. Schroeder spent nearly an hour verifying every entry Millie had made in his application for the job. Millard tried to smile and be cordial through the ordeal but was exasperated when his inquiry about the nature of the job was rebuffed with a curt, "You will be told about the job only if you qualify for it." Schroeder was particularly incisive in his questioning of Reeves' social history, insisting that Millie provide the name of each aunt, uncle, and cousin. He had, Millie insisted, no brothers and sisters.    At shortly after eleven, Dr. Schroeder abruptly terminated the interview, picked up the phone, and punched the three-number designation of another phone within the building.    "I'll be sending Millard Fillmore Reeves down to you when you're ready," Dr. Schroeder, in a slight German accent, informed the unseen party. "Now? Good." The German-born chemist put down the phone and directed Reeves to Room 207 for "further examination".
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Schroeder Process--as it was called in the trade--the procedure for making the miracle plastic, had a few slight defects which did require human participation in plant operations, at least until the bugs were worked out.    Twice in laboratory experiments, the process had gone awry. The result in one case was a fire, in the second the leakage of noxious vapors, deadly gases which were chemically related to those banned by the Geneva Convention, but somehow different: wherein lay the rub-the fact that electronic detectors had yet to be developed to automatically detect    the poisonous    fumes.     Despite    the experimental problems, Astrochem had gone forward with the construction of a full-scale production plan in the desert south of Albuquerque.    They hoped that the automated sensors, which were being developed to detect the toxic vapors, would be ready for installation by the time the complex was completed. The gas detectors were not, however, ready as scheduled. The enormously expensive    chemical manufacturing plant    sat    idle, at a considerable cost to Astrochem.    Raymond Ashley, President of Astrochem,    assigned Dr. Schroeder and the Chief of Plant Engineering, Terrence Rudick, to work out an immediate, interim solution to the problem. The two brilliant minds quickly devised a plan which included manual sensors and human involvement in process monitoring. Modifications to the factory were in process even while Millard Fillmore Reeves was being interviewed for one of four positions as Chemical Plant Controller for Astrochem.
</p>
<p>
Upon entering Room 207, Millie found that it was a medical doctor's office. A brusk physician ordered Reeves to disrobe. "Just like before spring tryouts," Millard kept recalling while the doctor ran him through his Hippocratic hoops. It was a very thorough physical examination: blood serology, X-rays, electrocardiogram, and even an electroencephalogram. With a grunt, the doctor finally signaled the conclusion of the examination and motioned Millard Reeves to clothe himself. The doctor rapidly wrote out his medical report. Reeves tried to sneak a peek at what the doctor was writing but the physician was carefully concealing his pen strokes with his free hand. The healer rolled his report into a cylinder, slipped it into a pipe-like container, popped the capsule in a pneumatic tube, dialed a destination, and sent the report on its way.    Millie was just buttoning the last button of his shirt. "Room 314," the barely articulate doctor pointed toward the door.    Millard Reeves thanked him, receiving a grunt in reply.
</p>
<p>
Terrence Rudick was reviewing the medical report before Millard Fillmore Reeves ever left the doctor's office. Rudick was especially interested in a notation printed in clear block letters: "EXCEPTIONAL PULMONARY CAPACITY". Mr. Fillmore, except for his never-to-be-completely-mended leg, was in as top condition as he had been playing football. Fillmore knocked and stuck his head into Room 314. "Hello, I'm Millie Reeves. The doctor sent me up." Rudick rose from his desk and shook the ex-athlete's hand cordially. "And I'm Terry Rudick. I'm Chief of Plant Engineering with Astrochem, which means I'll be your boss if you're hired. Here, have a chair and let's talk for awhile." Rudick cleared his throat. "Didn't you play for the Eagles a few seasons back, Millie? I seem to remember your name. It's one of those names which sort of sticks in your mind."    "Yes, Mr. Rudick, but that was quite a few seasons ago, really." "Well, time sure does fly.    Bet you still get mail from the fans though." "Not really. Maybe a card a month, or a letter from my college alumni association." "Yeah, Yeah. I'll bet you enjoy answering them" "Not really. I don't answer any of them." "Not even if, say, one of your uncles writes you a fan letter?" "They never do. They never write. And I never write them" Millie had the feeling Rudick was washing him into a backwater, trying to get him to admit to being an antisocial hermit. "But I have lots of friends. You should just see me at this swinging singles place I live in.    Wow. They could tell you." "Of course; of course." Rudick pressed an intercom buzzer. "Are you free?" he asked someone in an adjacent office. "Sure, come on in," the other voice invited.
</p>
<p>
The two men rose and walked down the hall to Suite 320, the executive offices of Raymond Ashley. Ashley greeted them affably and welcomed them into his inner office.    After exchanging niceties, Ashley got down to business~ "So you're interested in working for Astrochem, are you?    What do you know about us?" "Quite a good deal, Sir," Millie replied candidly, going on to recap a history of the company and its products that he had gleaned from a brochure in the Public Library.    "Very good," Ashley applauded.    "Who have you asked about us?" "No one, Mr. Ashley. I just did a little research." "Oh, I thought you might have mentioned to one of your friends that you were going to interview with us and they told you about Astrochem." "No, Mr. Ashley, I haven't mentioned it to anyone. I never expected things to ever get this far along." Ashley smiled sincerely at Millard Fillmore Reeves in reply before turning to Terrence Rudick. "Terry, I think we got our man here. Why don't you tell him about the job and see if he's interested." The two men shook Ashley's hand in departing and returned to Rudick's office.

Next Month: Part 3, Conclusion
</p>
<p>
<u>Association Minutes - September 7, 1978</u> ...........
</p>
<p>
Chairperson Paul Newman called the meeting to order at 12:31 p.m. There were 33 members in attendance.    Several guests were introduced, after which Paul introduced the guest speaker, Don Tierney, LEAP Administrator.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Tierney described how LEAP was originally developed by the Boeing Company as an internal financial management tool. In 1975 the state legislature became interested in the system and convinced the company to make the system available for legislative use. Boeing later converted the system to WDPSC and expanded its capabilities. Concurrently the state established a special statutory agency to support legislative information systems.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Tierney then described several proposed new applications of LEAP including tuition and fees modeling for higher education, modeling of higher education local funds, timber tax distribution models, and DSHS budgeting. He also described LEAP applications for projecting state payroll and retirement costs. He indicated that the system has been presented to some 20 or 25 states, with California and Arizona in the process of installing it now.
</p>
<p>
Following Mr. Tierney's talk, Paul Newman opened the business portion of the meeting. John Aikin gave the Treasurer's report, which indicated a balance of $376.42.
</p>
<p>
Jim Michael gave the DPA report, which described the very interesting events of the September DPA meeting revolving around the Administrator For the Courts' presentation.
</p>
<p>
Paul reiterated his appeal for a replacement for Patti Palmer as newsletter editor. (Come on folks, Patti has really been doing more than her share!)
</p>
<p>
Dick Applestone reported on the Job Matrix project. He indicated that Sam Mayo is writing new class specs, then asked Cliff Cotey to    report on a proposed approach based on a functional specification rather than simply a dollar volume managed.    Cliff reported that some work remains to be done finalizing point allocations for job tasks under the new system, but that the proposal seems likely to be accepted. It is probable that the proposed specs will go before the Personnel Board in September for adoption.
</p>
<p>
Cliff then reported on the Personnel Liaison Committee's work. He indicated that the indexing of job classes proposed by the Association is being accepted.
</p>
<p>
Don Smith reported for the Training Committee. The committee has met and reviewed the need survey.    Fourteen courses were recommended for Fall Quarter. The group was concerned about the proposed budget level. The group also reviewed its constituents and    determined that higher education need no longer be represented.
</p>
<p>
Galen Schmidtke reported that the Centralization/Decentralization Committee is circulating a draft policy analysis and will submit this draft to the DPA in the hope of having some input into the selection of the consultant being hired to re-examine the purpose of the Authority and aid in selecting a new Executive Director.
</p>
<p>
Bob Payne reported on the Security Standards being circulated by the DPA in draft form for comment.    He said these would be proposed to the Authority for adoption at the October 4 meeting and urged members to get their comments to him.
</p>
<p>
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.
