 Among issues in the months-long labor-management strife at 
the Taronga Zoo (Sydney, Australia): Workers have resisted 
managers' alleged solution for getting Kibabu the gorilla 
to mate (following his rejection of all females for
six years now), which was to have the keepers sedate him, 
stimulate him manually, and collect his sperm in a 
container (but that, said one keeper, would be "too bloody 
dangerous. What if he woke up?"). It now appears that zoo
officials are resigned to use technology instead, by a 
process called electro-ejaculation. Earlier, workers had 
announced a partial strike for a 3 percent pay increase, in 
that they would stop picking up animals' droppings
(whereupon management began docking their pay of the "poo 
allowance" of the equivalent of US $2.40 an hour. [Sydney 
Morning Herald, 10-31-02]

 On Nov. 2, skydiver Ron Sirull (1,000 career jumps) 
performed at the Air and Space Show at Vandenberg Air Force 
Base (just north of Lompoc, Calif.), accompanied by his 
Dachshund, Brutus the Skydiving Dog (100 career jumps), to
the protests of animal-rights activists but (according to 
Sirull) to the delight of Brutus, who was "totally turned 
on." (Brutus doesn't jump alone; he wears goggles and rides 
in Sirull's jumpsuit. According to Sirull, Brutus' vet
and the Arizona Humane Society say the jumps are safe.)

In August, Brian Lynch of Scotchtown, N.Y., was convicted 
of stealing $8,000 in donations intended for a Sept. 11 
FDNY widow. Also in August, Vernon Coleman, 32 (of 
Philadelphia), and Dane Coleman, 28 (of Upper Darby, Pa.) 
(who are not related), were arraigned on charges of 
stealing $35,000 from a donation fund for Afghan children 
displaced by the war. Also in August, New York City
landlord Denise M. Lyman announced she would not allow the 
family of Sept. 11 victim Danielle Kousoulis into 
Danielle's old apartment to secure DNA to help detect her 
remains because Danielle had breached her Sept. 1, 2001, 
lease by failing to give three months' notice 
before "abandoning" the apartment. [St. Petersburg Times, 8-
18-02] [USA Today, 8-16-02] [CBSNews.com, 8-27-02]

Chutzpah! <BR>
<P>

 According to a September New York Times report, New York 
City homeless-shelter workers believe that "50 to 75 
percent" of the current population of 8,000 families (2,000 
more than the year before) are "unreasonably picky" about
moving into permanent assisted housing, thus remaining in 
temporary apartments at an average cost to the city of 
$2,800 per family per month. Sara Kelly, a mother of six 
and eight-year assisted-housing client, said she could not 
accept a three-bedroom apartment because "you had to walk 
through one bedroom to get to another bedroom to get to a 
bathroom (and) I can't live like that. (I am) choosy about 
where I live." [New York Times, 9-16-02]

 In White River Junction, Vt., in October, Stewart Fuller, 
41, was charged with looting about $30,000 worth of goods 
from the house of neighbors Roger and Shirley Labelle (who 
were away) and holding a three-day yard sale nearby so
that when the Labelles returned, they couldn't help but 
notice that some of their neighbors had their stuff.

 Earlier this year, 89 wives, daughters and lovers of 
wealthy or powerful Mexican men posed chicly in extravagant 
settings with complete lack of inhibition about their 
opulence, for photographer Daniela Rossell's
coffee-table book, "Ricas y Famosas" ("Rich and Famous"), 
thus appearing to taunt the 53 percent of Mexicans who live 
in poverty. Rossell, who comes from the upper class 
herself, and is thought to have made the book in part 
because of conflicted views of her upbringing, has since 
received threats from the embarrassed wealthy, who 
apparently miscalculated how their pictures would be
perceived. [The Observer (London), 9-15-02]

Life Imitates a Rodney Dangerfield Joke 
<P>

Herbert Toney, 36, and Latisha Washington, 29, were 
arrested in October in St. Bernard Parish, just outside New 
Orleans, and face several charges including deserting their 
8-year-old son. According to police, the couple instructed 
the son to go into a Winn Dixie supermarket and steal 
groceries and beer. When a security guard stopped him, the 
boy pointed out his parents nearby, but Toney and 
Washington matter-of-factly denied knowing the kid and 
walked away. Deputies brought the couple in again a while 
later, but Washington said only that maybe she had seen the 
boy around the neighborhood a few times. Finally,
she admitted he was hers. [The Times-Picayune, 10-4-02]

Extremely Effective Clothing <BR>

According to a July Reuters photo dispatch from the 
mountains of northeast Colombia, U'wa Indian girls' 
traditional "cocora" hats, designed to encourage
chastity from puberty until marriage, consist of oversized 
cones made of layers of large sheets of green leaves, all 
completely covering the girls' heads, except for narrow eye 
slits. [Straits Times-Reuters, 7-10-02]

Suspected cult leader Scott Caruthers, 57, was arrested in 
September in Carroll County, Md., and charged with 
conspiracy to murder the ex-husbands of two of his alleged 
disciples; according to a Baltimore Sun report, Caruthers 
has claimed to be an alien who reported back to the mother 
ship by messages to cats. And Dem Mam, 54, head of a fringe 
Buddhist cult, was freed from custody in October, having 
been determined not responsible for three disciples'
immolating themselves in a bathtub of gasoline in a 
Cambodian countryside pagoda; Dem Mam teaches that ritual 
suicide is the only path to heaven but told police that he 
did not need to commit suicide himself because he is already
holy enough. [Baltimore Sun, 9-8-02] [Reuters, 10-1-02, 10-

Least Competent Criminals <BR>

Ronnie Dale Jones, 33, was arrested in Brevard, N.C., in 
September after he, for some reason, drove into a parking 
lot and past several police officers standing by their 
cars, talking; Jones apparently had momentarily forgotten he
had a very large marijuana plant in his back seat. And a 22-
year-old man was detained by a sheriff's deputy in 
Gainesville, Fla., in October after he had been stopped 
routinely for an expired tag; as the men were conversing 
casually, the deputy noticed a rolled-up marijuana joint 
behind the man's ear (to which the motorist said, "Man, I 
forgot that was back there"). [Transylvania Times,

Multitasking Gone Too Far <BR>
<P>

In Tucson, Ariz., in August, Iris Jazmin Rangel, 24, was 
sentenced to three years' probation in the death of her 10-
month-old daughter in a minor collision caused by Rangel's 
inability to brake quickly enough; her attention was
diverted because she was breastfeeding the girl at the 
time. And South Carolina Highway Patrol officers said in 
July that Marie Butler, 20, triggered a five-car collision 
on State Road 90, sending three people to the hospital, when
she lost control of her car while changing clothes during 
her drive to work. [Arizona Republic-AP, 8-14-02] [Myrtle

The North Korean government gave its top yearly science 
prize to Pyongyang Hospital for developing a rhubarb-and-
marijuana concoction that is "97 percent effective" in 
curing constipation. Adele Robinson and several other New 
York City public-school contract teachers were mailed 
checks for 1 cent to correct a calculation error on summer-
class pay. Cheyenne Harley Kahnapace, 26, pleaded
guilty to violating his parole restrictions after a police 
officer caught him out for a walk pushing a baby stroller 
containing a small keg of beer (Regina, Saskatchewan). 
Prominent entomologist Elmo Hardy passed away at age 88, his
legacy secure in that 50 species of flies are named for him 
(Honolulu). [Reuters, 10-31-02] [Newsday, 10-25-02] [Sault
