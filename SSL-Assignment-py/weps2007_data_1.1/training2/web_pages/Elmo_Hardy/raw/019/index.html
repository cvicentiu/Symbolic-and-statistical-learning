There were no objections from the Board.

<H4>Awarding of a Regents' Medal of Distinction</H4>

<P>	Vice Chairperson Tanoue informed that a meeting of the Committee on University Relations had taken place on November 6, 1997, at which time a list of nominees for the Regents' medal was received.  That meeting was recessed and reconvened on November 13, 1997, at Maui Community College.  At that time, the consensus of the Committee was to receive all of the nominations.  The administration reviewed the nominations, applying the Board's current policy criteria and the President had prepared a recommendation.  She emphasized that the Committee on University Relations still wished to receive the President's recommendations on revised policies and procedures, particularly revisions that would provide for greater public involvement and student input in the process of nominating recipients for a Regents' medal.

<P>	President Mortimer explained that the Board has several means by which it can recognize individuals for their accomplishments and contributions to the University.  The Board's policies include provisions for a Regents' Medal of Distinction, awarded to individuals of exceptional accomplishment and distinction who have made significant contributions to the University, state, region or nation, or within their field of endeavor.  In accordance with the Board's policy, he then recommended that the Regents' Medal of Distinction be awarded to Mr. George Chaplin, Dr. D. Elmo Hardy, Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka, Senator Mamoru Yamasaki (ret.), and Dr. Elwood C. Zimmerman in recognition of their distinguished record of service and contributions to the State of Hawai`i and the University of Hawai`i.  

<H4>Mr. George Chaplin </H4>

<P>	Mr. George Chaplin is known throughout Hawai`i for his 26 years as Editor-in-Chief of the Honolulu Advertiser.  What may not be as widely recognized locally is that his reputation as an outstanding journalist has brought credit to himself and to Hawai`i far beyond our shores.  He was one of the early Nieman Fellows at Harvard (1940-41), is a past president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors (1976-77), and is active in the International Press Institute and the Society of Professional Journalists.

<P>	Nationally, Mr. Chaplin has received two Overseas Press Club citations for his writings on China, Japan and Southeast Asia; two John Hancock awards for economic reporting on U.S.-Japan relations; the Champion Media Award for Economic Understanding; a Headliners award for feature writing, and the charter Scripps-Howard Foundation award for outstanding service in the cause of a free press.  He has served twice as a Pulitzer Prize juror at Columbia University and has written extensively on Japan, the Soviet Union, the Eastern European bloc, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Fiji, Tahiti, Spain and Israel, among others.

<P>	In 1985, the Emperor of Japan conferred on Mr. Chaplin the Order of the Rising Sun for his efforts over the years to further better understanding between the U.S. and Japan.  He also has been decorated by Italy (The Star of Solidarity) and Israel (the Prime Minister's Medal).

<P>	With respect to community service, he is or has served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the East-West Center; Chairman of the Hawai`i Governor's Advisory Council on Foreign Language and International Studies; Chairman of the Governor's Conference on the year 2000; Co-Chair of the Hawai`i Project on Alternative Economic Futures; initiator of the project Goals for Hawai`i; co-editor of "Hawai`i 2000" (University Press of Hawai`i); and Co-Chairman of the Hawai`i Committee on Racial Tensions.  In addition, he has served as a Director of the Honolulu Symphony Society; as a member of the Hawai`i Committee on Foreign Relations; member of the Pacific and Asian Affairs Council; member of the Japan-American Society of Honolulu; Board of Directors of the Research Corporation of the University of Hawai`i; Board of Directors of the Aloha United Way; and the Chamber of Commerce of Hawai`i.  He has served as U.S. Alternate Delegate to the South Pacific Commission.

<P>	In 1962, Mr. Chaplin triggered the nationwide campaign that raised sufficient funds to build the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, and for this was presented the Meritorious Citation of the Navy League of the United States.  In 1982, he received the University of Hawai`i Trustees Award for Distinguished Leadership.  In 1985, he chaired Temple Emanu-el's 25th anniversary on the Pali and headed its successful $250,000 capital funds appeal.  

<P>	Among his many honors, Mr. Chaplin was honored by the Pacific and Asian Affairs Council, the State PTA, and the United Filipino Council.  The Pacific and Asian Affairs Council's award for distinguished contribution to the understanding of international affairs in Hawai`i, stated that his leadership expanded the Advertiser's horizons and made it a more effective community force. 

<H4>Dr. D. Elmo Hardy</H4>

<P>	Dr. D. Elmo Hardy's contributions to the University of Hawai`i's international reputation in evolutionary biology has been profound.  He joined the entomology faculty at the University of Hawai`i in 1948 and soon began his studies of Hawaiian and Pacific area Diptera.  He has authored or co-authored 5 volumes of the "Insects of Hawai`i" treating another 1613 species in almost 2600 pages.  His monograph (volume 12) on the Hawaiian drosophilids was the foundation for subsequent pioneering work on the genetics and evolutionary biology of this important group.  This work has established the University of Hawai`i as a world class research institution in Hawaiian evolutionary biology.  

<P>	Dr. Hardy is world renown not only for his seminal research on Hawaiian drosophilid flies, but he is also the world authority on the big-headed flies (family Pipunculidae), which are important in agro-ecosystems in Hawai`i; the love bugs (flies of the family Bibionidae), and has spent the last 20 years studying the family Tephritidae in Hawai`i and the Pacific.  These last flies contain some of the most notorious crop pests better known as the medfly, melon fly, and oriental fruit fly.  Dr. Hardy's initial work on these flies has engendered further research by colleagues in Australia and biocontrol centers throughout the tropical Pacific.

<P>	The monumental "Insects of Hawai`i" also established the University of Hawai`i Press as a premiere scholarly press and demonstrated the lasting value of scholarly publishing.  

<H4>Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka</H4>

<P>	Mr. Hiroshi "Scrub" Tanaka devoted a lifetime of distinguished service for  the people of the State of Hawai`i as a community advocate and proponent of higher education.  For more than five decades, Scrub has given unselfishly of his time and energy to support activities that benefit the people of the Big Island, the University of Hawai`i, and the State of Hawai`i.

<P>	A native of Honokaa, Hawai`i, Scrub Tanaka served with the U.S. Army's   Military Intelligence Service in Burma, Australia, and the Philippines during World War II from 1943-1945 and has the distinction of being the first American soldier to enter Hiroshima to aid in the restoration of the city following the devastation caused by the atomic bomb.   

<P>	Following his return from military service, Scrub became an important force in shaping the Big Island's destiny during the second half of the 20th century.  It was during this period that he became involved in politics, rising in prominence as a strategist during the era of former Governor John Burns.  Since that time, he has been an advisor to generations of legislators and political aspirants.  

<P>	Scrub's support and contributions towards the development of the UH-Hilo campus and the Big Island economy have been significant.  He was instrumental in helping obtain the 600-plus acres of State land located mauka of the existing campus which is today the University's high-tech park and home to several support facilities for astronomy research.  He is also a strong believer in the importance of a good intercollegiate athletics program at UH-Hilo to promote campus pride and recognition.  He assisted in the organization of the Vulcan's Boosters Club and has contributed in many valuable ways to the fundraising activities of that organization.

<P>	Through adverse economic times when a tsunami devastated a major portion of Hilo to the post-sugar period, Scrub Tanaka has been instrumental in helping with the economic development of the Big Island community.  As a member of the County Board of Supervisors, he  played a major role in enabling and implementing the Kaiko'o Urban Renewal Project after the 1960 tsunami.  He served on the Board of Supervisors for the County of Hawai`i from 1952-1960 (including two terms as Board chair); as Commissioner on the State Board of Land and Natural Resources from 1966-1970; and on the Board of Directors for the Hawai`i County Economic Opportunity Council.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Hawai`i Japanese Chamber of Commerce and the American Cancer Society.

<H4>Senator Mamoru Yamasaki</H4>

<P>	Retired Senator Mamoru Yamasaki began his career in public service in 1956 as a member of the State Democratic Central Committee.  Soon thereafter he was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1959 and served until 1968 when he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the State Senate.  He served in the State Senate continuously for 24 years, representing the 4th Senatorial District on Maui.  For 11 of those 24 years, he served as Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, which handles appropriations for the Senate.  Senator Yamasaki holds the State record for the longest serving legislator with over 33 years of continuous public service to the State of Hawai`i.

<P>	During his tenure in the legislature, Senator Yamasaki was a staunch supporter of public education and higher education, supporting the appropriation of funds for a variety of academic programs and capital improvement projects for the University of Hawai`i.  He was considered an early champion of distance education and a supporter of outreach programs which could deliver college courses and degree programs to residents on the neighbor islands.

<P>	Senator Yamasaki's high regard for education and his devotion to Hawai`i's children and young people were well known.  His support for early childhood education and projects like Head Start, Healthy Start, and Healthy and Ready to Learn is legendary.  His commitment to youth continues today through his participation in organizations like the Boy Scouts and other non-profit agencies concerned with early childhood development.

<P>	Throughout his term in office, Senator Yamasaki was viewed with respect by colleagues and constituents alike for his fairness, honesty, politeness, and humility.  A man of few words, Senator Yamasaki was nevertheless admired and respected as a skillful negotiator and for his astuteness in chairing the powerful Senate Ways and Means Committee.

<H4>Dr. Elwood Zimmerman</H4>

<P>	Dr. Elwood Zimmerman began his association with Hawai`i in 1934 as an entomologist with the Bishop Museum on the famed Mangarevan Expedition.  During his residency in Hawai`i from 1934 into the 1960's, he worked as a researcher, teacher, and curator for Bishop Museum, University of Hawai`i, and Hawai`i Sugar Planters' Association. 

<P>	In 1948, he launched the series, "Insects of Hawai`i," with the publication of the first five volumes.  Quite simply, the monumental series provides the foundation for all entomological activities in Hawai`i.  Between 1948 and 1978, Zimmerman published nine volumes totaling some 4800 pages treating 2275 species, or nearly one half of the known fauna.  Volume l, Introduction, has become a classic and is regarded as one of the best treatments on island biology.  In addition, Dr. Zimmerman has published an eight-volume monograph totaling 4300 pages on the weevils of Australia and over 200 research papers on the natural history of Pacific islands.  In total, he has published over 10,000 pages.

<P>	Dr. Zimmerman was one of the early voices advocating the conservation of Hawai`i's unique native ecology.  Today, he remains active as a senior entomologist with the Australian government.  His legacy and contributions to Hawai`i's scientific community and to the study of Hawaiian ecology are deserving of recognition by the University of Hawai`i.

<P>	Regent Kim moved to award the Regents' Medal of Distinction to Mr. George Chaplin, Dr. D. Elmo Hardy, Mr. Hiroshi "Scrub" Tanaka, Senator Mamoru Yamasaki, and Dr. Elwood Zimmerman for their significant contributions to the State of Hawai`i and the University of Hawai`i, as presented in President's Memorandum No. 53 (Agenda), Item A-2, dated December 12, 1997.  Regent McElrath seconded the motion.

<P>	Regent McElrath said that Senator Yamasaki was one of the early founding members of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's union on Maui.  Because of that particular union, he entered politics and took a great interest in elementary and post-secondary education, and the youth of Hawai`i.  Regent Ohigashi, concurring with Regent McElrath's statement, suggested that this information on Senator Yamasaki be noted for the record.   Vice Chairperson Tanoue directed that the minutes reflect Regent McElrath's commentary on Senator Yamasaki's involvement with the labor movement in Hawai`i. 

<P>	Regent Roehrig said that when he arrived on the Big Island in 1965 one of the first persons he met in Hilo was Scrub Tanaka.  When he was appointed to the Legislature in 1969, Scrub was interested in expanding UH-Hilo's two-year program to a four-year university.  Governor Burns agreed that if the Legislature would extend the operations from a two-year to a four-year program he would approve the legislation.  The principles of that legislation, according to Regent Roehrig, were Governor Burns and Scrub.  He added that this is the 50th anniversary of the University of Hawai`i at Hilo and it is particularly appropriate that the Board has chosen to recognize Senator Yamasaki and Scrub Tanaka for the work they have done for the University.

<P>	Upon call, the motion was carried unanimously.

<P>	Vice Chairperson Tanoue said that it was with great pride that the Board honor these individuals.
