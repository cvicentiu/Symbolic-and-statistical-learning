The officers heard a gunshot as they passed a stopped car, and after calling for backup, they approached the car and arrested the two occupants. During the arrest, one of the men admitted firing one shot at the police, but did it because he needed them to help him fix a tire. -Ananova: 1/27/02<hr noshade size=1>2...<a href="?View&SQL_DATABASE=metasphere&SQL_TABLE=newsoftheweird&by=&flip=&VIEW=ID&Q_ID_REQUIRE=2"> Florida Pick Pocketing Ring Led By Grandmother</a>... A statewide pick pocketing ring in Florida, that was aimed at the elderly, was allegedly run by a 65-year-old grandmother, who has been arrested 29 times since 1960. The women, named Ernestine Williams, led the 15-person operation, and taught each pickpocket the tricks of the trade. She has told police that she instructed her accomplices to target the elderly, because they were easy targets. Williams, a mother of 12, led the crime ring from her wheelchair, lasting 2 years until a Florida Department of Law Enforcement officer broke up the ring, arrested the members, including Ernestine and several of her family members. Ernestine Williams has pled guilty to racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, two grand theft charges and three misdemeanor theft charges. She faces four to eight years in prison, according to Florida state sentencing guidelines. -South Florida Sun Sentinel: 4/2/02 -FDLE Press Release: 10/15/00 -ABC News: 10/26/00 -Associated Press: 10/26/00<hr noshade size=1>3...<a href="?View&SQL_DATABASE=metasphere&SQL_TABLE=newsoftheweird&by=&flip=&VIEW=ID&Q_ID_REQUIRE=3"> Convicted Murderer Sues Jail Because He Can't Sleep</a>...David Wild, 65, is attempting to sue a prison in Canada where he is being held, because the guards keep him up all night.

He says that he has suffered permanent headaches, blurred and double vision, loss of balance and depression, all caused by noisy guards. -Ananova: 3/14/02<hr noshade size=1>4...<a href="?View&SQL_DATABASE=metasphere&SQL_TABLE=newsoftheweird&by=&flip=&VIEW=ID&Q_ID_REQUIRE=4"> Man Found Hiding Six Years After End Of War</a>... Even though the war in Bosnia has been over for many years, a man has been found hiding out - 6 years after the war stopped. The hermit was found hiding in the mountains of Bosnia, by British soldiers on a peacekeeping mission, and when he was told that the war was over, he was very surprised. The man, identified as Illija Panincic, had fled to the mountains surrounding the town of Sipovo, and lived off of twigs and berries for the duration of his stay. He was found in an abandon cabin in the mountains, and since they found him, British soldiers have been traveling great distances to deliver food to him. -Ananova: 2/21/02<hr noshade size=1>5...<a href="?View&SQL_DATABASE=metasphere&SQL_TABLE=newsoftheweird&by=&flip=&VIEW=ID&Q_ID_REQUIRE=5"> Assassin Mistakenly Honored At Martin Luther King Celebration</a>... The town of Lauderhill, Florida is very upset after a plaque intended to honor James Earl Jones instead honored the wrong man. The plaque was to be displayed at a celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, but instead of honoring Jones, the plaque read, &quot;Thank you James Earl Ray for keeping the dream alive.&quot; James Earl Ray was the man who assassinated King in 1968. A Merit Industries spokesman Herbert Miller, said that it was caused by an unintentional error, &quot;We in no way meant any disrespect. It was an honest error.&quot; -BBC: 1/17.02 -Associated Press: 1/16/02 -Reuters: 1/16/02 -CNN: 1/16/02<hr noshade size=1>6...<a href="?View&SQL_DATABASE=metasphere&SQL_TABLE=newsoftheweird&by=&flip=&VIEW=ID&Q_ID_REQUIRE=6">Zoo Labor</a>...Among issues in the months-long labor-management strife at the Taronga Zoo (Sydney, Australia): Workers have resisted managers' alleged solution for getting Kibabu the gorilla to mate (following his rejection of all females for six years now), which was to have the keepers sedate him, stimulate him manually, and collect his sperm in a container (but that, said one keeper, would be %22too bloody dangerous. What if he woke up?%22). It now appears that zoo officials are resigned to use technology instead, by a process called electro-ejaculation. Earlier, workers had announced a partial strike for a 3 percent pay increase, in that they would stop picking up animals' droppings (whereupon management began docking their pay of the %22poo allowance%22 of the equivalent of US $2.40 an hour.

Also in August, Vernon Coleman, 32 (of Philadelphia), and Dane Coleman, 28 (of Upper Darby, Pa.) (who are not related), were arraigned on charges of stealing $35,000 from a donation fund for Afghan children displaced by the war. Also in August, New York City landlord Denise M.

When a security guard stopped him, the boy pointed out his parents nearby, but Toney and Washington matter-of-factly denied knowing the kid and walked away. Deputies brought the couple in again a while later, but Washington said only that maybe she had seen the boy around the neighborhood a few times. Finally, she admitted he was hers.

Mosley admits that she produced a false ID card at that time, showing that she was over 18, for the express purpose of receiving the abortion without having her parents notified. Now, Mosley apparently regrets the abortion and claims the clinic should have detected that her ID was false and thus notified her parents, who, Mosley believes, would have talked her out of the abortion.
