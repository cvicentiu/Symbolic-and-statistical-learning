Fitzgerald and RJFCO, and remand only for enforcement proceedings against
those two individuals and the firm. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><CENTER>I.  Procedural Background</CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	In 1999, CFTC commenced this CEA enforcement case by filing a
Complaint against Defendants/Appellees RJFCO, Raymond Fitzgerald, Leiza
Fitzgerald, Chuck Kowlaski, and Greg Burnett, alleging that they were involved in
fraudulent solicitations to attract potential customers throughout the United States
to invest in commodity options, in violation of the Act and related federal
regulations.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  This Complaint was dismissed essentially for failure to plead fraud
with particularity.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The District Court then required CFTC to file an Amended Complaint
detailing every fact it intended to prove in establishing liability under the ACT. 
CFTC complied with that request, filing an extensive 138 page, 15 count
Complaint which sets the framework for the instant case.  The Amended
Complaint alleged that Defendants, or some individual Defendants, violated the
Act by: (1) committing fraud by misrepresentation or omission of material facts in
connection with the solicitation, maintenance, or execution of commodity futures
transactions; (2) operating an introducing brokerage firm to cheat, defraud,
deceive, or attempt to cheat, defraud or deceive clients; (3) trading client accounts
excessively in order to generate commissions without regard to customer interests
("churning"); (4) failing to provide risk disclosure statements prior to the opening
of RJFCO customer accounts; and (5) failing to supervise firm personnel
diligently.  Defendant Raymond Fitzgerald was charged with "controlling person"
liability under the Act.  The various allegations in the Amended Complaint
encompass claims grounded in 7 U.S.C. §  6c(b), 17 C.F.R. §  33.10(a) and (c), 17
C.F.R. §  166.3, and 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Counts one, two, seven and nine alleged that Raymond Fitzgerald, as
principal of RJFCO, RJFCO, Leiza Fitzgerald and Greg Burnett committed fraud
by misrepresentation or omission of material facts in connection with the
solicitation of commodity futures transactions.  Counts three, ten and fifteen
charged Raymond Fitzgerald, as principal of RJFCO, RJFCO, Greg Burnett and
Chuck Kowalski with operating an introducing brokerage to cheat, defraud,
deceive, or attempt to cheat, defraud or deceive clients.  Counts four and eleven
charged Raymond Fitzgerald, RJFCO, and Greg Burnett with committing fraud by
trading client accounts excessively to generate commissions without regard to
client interests.  Count five charged Raymond Fitzgerald and RJFCO with failing
to provide adequate risk disclosure statements prior to opening customer accounts. 
Counts six, eight, and twelve charged Raymond Fitzgerald, Leiza Fitzgerald and
Greg Burnett with failing to supervise diligently the sales practices and
solicitations of RJFCO brokers.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	After some of the claims in the Amended Complaint were dismissed on
summary judgment, the parties agreed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Fed. R.
Civ. P. 73, to conduct a bench trial before a Magistrate Judge<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>.  That trial
commenced on February 26, 2001.  On March 8, 2001, the Court heard oral
argument and granted what it labeled a "directed verdict" against a significant part
of the CFTC's case.  Germaine to this appeal, and as will be explained further
below, the District Court granted relief to Defendants on that part of the CFTC's
claim that the Commercial violated the Act as well as on the claim that Defendants
had a duty to disclose their specific trading record (i.e., their success rate) to
potential customers.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The trial pressed forward to completion on the remaining claims in the
Amended Complaint and concluded on March 19, 2001.  Thereafter, the District
Court entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, ruling in favor of
all Defendants on all counts in the Amended Complaint.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See CFTC v. R.J.
Fitzgerald &amp; Co.</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Inc</EM>., 173 F. Supp.2d 1295 (M.D. Fla. 2001).  CFTC appeals,
essentially arguing that regardless of the Court's factual findings based on witness
credibility, Defendants committed fraud and other CEA violations as a matter of
law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	RJFCO was a full service "introducing broker" at all times relevant to this
appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See </EM>7 U.S.C. § 1a.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">  RJFCO's obligations to those with whom it dealt were
guaranteed by Iowa Grain Company ("Iowa Grain"), a registered futures
commission merchant.  RJFCO opened for business in 1992.  It operated as a firm
designed to service small customer accounts, where the customer base had little
experience in commodities markets.  RJFCO operated in a perhaps unique manner
in the commodities industry in that it used one team of sales brokers for generating
customers via telephone calls and a separate team of brokers and traders to do the
actual trades and monitor accounts.  Defendant Raymond Fitzgerald was the
principal of RJFCO and was responsible for all decisions, actions, and trading
recommendations made or entered into by the firm.  Defendant Leiza Fitzgerald's
responsibilities at RJFCO involved developing training materials and training
sales brokers.  Greg Burnett was an associated person at RJFCO and was
responsible for supervising traders and brokers.  Chuck  Kowalski was RJFCO's
chief financial analyst, responsible for studying the commodities markets and
developing trades and trade strategies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	At the heart of this appeal are two solicitation devices used by RJFCO to
attract customers to invest in options on futures contracts: the Commercial and the
Seminar.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">		1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Commercial</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	 The Commercial stated that "the El Nino [weather phenomenon] has struck
where expected, and if patterns continue, the effects could be devastating. 
Droughts, floods, and other adverse conditions could drastically alter the supply
and demand dynamics of the corn market . . . ."  The Commercial also declared
that "[w]ith the giant developing nations, such as China and Russia badly in need
of grains and world grain supplies put to the test, conditions may exist for profits
as high as 200 to 300 percent."  This was accompanied by a graphic statement on
the television screen that the percentages were a mathematical example of
leverage.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">The Commercial further asserted that "the potential of the corn market may never
be greater.  Tight U.S. reserves coupled with domestic and worldwide demands
could be the formula for a trade you won't want to miss.  Find out how as little as
$5,000 could translate into profits as high as 200 to 300 percent.  Call R.J.
Fitzgerald today . . . ."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The Commercial was initially drafted by an advertising agency.  When
Raymond Fitzgerald first received the script, he edited it to add additional risk
disclosures that would appear just above the firm's phone number, so that anyone
watching the Commercial would see the risk disclosure.  He further insisted that
this disclosure appear more than half the time the Commercial was running.  After
his edits were done, he sent the script to Iowa Grain's chief compliance officer,
Anne Farris.  Iowa Grain approved the script on February 18, 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The Commercial actually ran on CNBC for the first half of March, 1998, but
did not generate much business.  In total, it appeared about eight or nine times and
was then discontinued.  At some point after its discontinuation, Raymond
Fitzgerald was contacted by a National Futures Association ("NFA")<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> compliance
officer, who expressed concern over the Commercial's content.  More specifically,
the NFA officer, David Croom, informed Raymond Fitzgerald that the
Commercial was in apparent violation of NFA rules because: (1) it was misleading
in that it failed to tell potential customers that the options spoken of were "out-of-the money options" that would require a dramatic move in the options premium
value in order for the customer to see gains equal to that claimed in the
Commercial; (2) misleadingly gave the impression that weather events were
inevitable; (3) did not display the risk of loss statement prominently enough on the
screen; and (4) downplayed the risk of loss.  In response to this concern, Raymond
Fitzgerald informed Croom that the Commercial had already been discontinued
and would not be aired again.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	At the close of CFTC's case, and before the defense was presented, the
District Court entered a directed verdict in favor of Defendants on the part of the
claim that the Commercial was fraudulent and violated the CEA.  The District
Court addressed the Commercial again in its opinion issued after the bench trial,
stating that the Commercial was not "misleading or deceptive" and that there was
no "intent to defraud." 173 F. Supp.2d at 1310.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">		2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RJFCO's 1998 Promotional Seminar</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to the Commercial, CFTC alleged CEA violations occurred in a
promotional seminar used by RJFCO to attract customers.  The Seminar was
developed by Leiza Fitzgerald and RJFCO brokers Scott Campbell and Tom West
after they attended a training session on the topic conducted by the National
Introducing Brokers Association.<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The Seminar informed customers that weather patterns, political events, and
historical trends can affect the prices of certain commodities.  The Seminar also
told customers that technical analysis could assist them in the commodity options
market, since "history often repeats itself" and "past price action can provide you
with clues to future action."  Customers were told they could "take advantage" of
"fundamental" market moves such as weather events and political events and
"technical theory" such as past market movements through either futures or
options investing.  The Seminar also drew a distinction between investment
instruments based on the quantum of risk involved:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">		Which one you choose depends on how aggressive or what
degree of risk you wish to take on.				</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">		If you are highly aggressive and looking for unlimited profit
potential as well as unlimited risk than [sic] it would be the
futures.  But most would like something less aggressive,
something offering unlimited profit potential but limited risk--option trade [sic].</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">On the topic of risk, the Seminar additionally told potential customers: "options on
futures allow investors and risk mangers to define risk and limit it to the loss of a
premium paid for the right to buy or sell a futures contract while still providing . . .
unlimited profit potential."    </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The RJFCO employees who conducted the Seminar offered what the
Seminar script deemed a "very exciting" illustration of how profits could be made
on options.  Specifically, the Seminar focused on the commodity heating oil,
explaining that for the last eighteen years, there was an average increase in that
commodity "of 22 cents from the low to the high in the price range" and that a
$5,000 investment on a heating oil futures contract would result in $46,200 if
there was a 22 cent move in the price.  Customers were told that if they wanted
"limited risk," they could invest in an option contract, where they would receive
"approximately 50% of that profit-46,200 divided by 2 equals $23,100."<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	In its opinion following the bench trial, the District Court concluded that the
Seminar did not violate the CEA.  The District Court explained that there was
nothing "patently or latently misleading or deceitful" about the profit illustrations
used in the seminar.  173 F. Supp.2d at 1311.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">			<CENTER>III. Discussion</CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The District Court had jurisdiction over this case under 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3) and
28 U.S.C. § 1291.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	It is somewhat unclear from the briefing what specific parts of the judgment
below are being challenged by CFTC, especially given the large number of
allegations in the extremely lengthy Amended Complaint.  CFTC's initial brief
requests that this Court "reverse the district court's judgment and remand with
instructions to enter judgment in favor of appellant CFTC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>on the Amended
Complaint</EM>."  Appellant's Brief at 57.  However, we can construe the CFTC's
appellate position from the briefing and from oral argument.  It specifically
challenges these discrete aspects of the District Court's judgment: (1) the
Commercial did not violate the Act; (2) the Seminar did not violate the Act; (3) 
Defendants had no duty to disclose their trading record to potential customers; (4) 
Defendants did not excessively trade their customers' accounts without regard to
customer interest; and (5) Raymond Fitzgerald did not have "controlling person"
liability under the Act.  As explained below, we agree that the District Court erred
in not finding liability as a matter of law under the Act for the Commercial, the
Seminar, and for failure to disclose RJFCO's trading record in both.  We further
agree that Raymond Fitzgerald is liable in this case as a "controlling person" at the
firm.  We do not disturb the District Court's judgment as to the remaining alleged
points of error. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	CFTC argues that the District Court erred because the Commercial is
fraudulent as a matter of law.  Upon review of the full text of the Commercial, we
are constrained to agree.  The CEA and its accompanying regulations directly
proscribe attempts to deceive and defraud in connection with futures and options
trading.  17 C.F.R. §  33.10 provides:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	It shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly:</SPAN></P>

three elements: (1) the making of a misrepresentation, misleading statement, or a
deceptive omission; (2) scienter; and (3) materiality.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Hammond v. Smith

as a matter of law.  Defendant acted recklessly with regard to the statements aired
on television.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">This recklessness is premised on the fact that this Court and the
CFTC have previously condemned attempts to attract customers by: (1) linking
profit expectations on commodities options to known and expected weather
events, seasonal trends, and historical highs; (2) suggesting that the commodities
market can be correctly timed to generate large profits; and (3) substantially
inflating option profit expectations while downplaying risk of loss.  We hold that
Defendant, as a federally registered professional, knowledgeable in the nuances
and complexities of the industry, deviated in an extreme manner from the
standards of ordinary care.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The final element, materiality, is satisfied as well.  It is too obvious for
debate that a reasonable listener's choice-making process would be substantially
affected by emphatic statements on profit potential ("200-300%") and the
suggestion that known and expected weather events are the vehicle for achieving
those enormous profits.  A reasonable investor would also be heavily influenced
by the suggestion in the Commercial that, due to weather events, the present day
offers an opportunity like no other to make money in the corn market.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See In re

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Defendants argue that scienter is lacking with regard to the Commercial
because Raymond Fitzgerald edited the Commercial to include more disclosures,
sought and received approval from Iowa Grain, and assured NFA official Croom
that the Commercial had already been discontinued after Croom expressed
concern over its misleading content.  None of these arguments can overcome the
CFTC's position that prior cases establish the illegality of the Commercial's
content as a matter of law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">  Moreover, Defendants should not be able to escape
liability under the Act by simply claiming that a related private business entity
(Iowa Grain) issued its stamp of approval.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Iowa Grain does not determine with

District Court's finding that the Commercial was not "deceptive or misleading,"
asserting that CFTC cannot possibly leap the barrier of this highly deferential
standard of review.  We are not persuaded.  It is too well-settled for dispute that
findings of fact which flow directly from the observation of witnesses at trial
cannot be reversed unless clearly erroneous.  But that doctrine of appellate review
is not implicated here.  This is not a situation where we must defer to a trial court's
conclusion of fact because that conclusion rests on the unique opportunity to
personally scrutinize live testimony at trial and measure credibility word by word. 
Rather, the precise language in the Commercial is an undisputed part of the
appellate record.  The fraudulent and deceptive nature of that language is, as
CFTC posits, established as a matter of law in precedent.  The precise error at the
district court level is definitively legal in nature: it is the failure to recognize that
the outcome of CFTC's claim on the uncontested words in the Commercial is
controlled by case law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See generally Lincoln v. Board of Regents</EM>, 697 F.2d  928,

historical movements and known and expected seasonal patterns can be used
reliably to predict profits on options.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">The Seminar gave those in attendance a
deceptive impression that known seasonal trends will lead to their quick success
and that options provide a scenario of "limited risk."  In this regard, we are
especially concerned with the Seminar's suggestion toward the end of the
undisputed script that "greed" is a major </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">reason people do not make money in

the Seminar's use of risk disclosure material, the overall impression is that RJFCO
is going to make customers money if they invest in options.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Such conduct simply
cannot survive under the Act, its underlying purpose, its regulations, and the
interpretive case law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"> 	As with the Commercial, the statements in the Seminar
are clearly material because an objectively reasonable investor's decision-making
process would be substantially affected by the Seminar's discussion on limited
risk, cyclical heating oil-weather patterns, and examples and illustrations of large
profits.  Such representations, as a matter of law, alter the total mix of relevant
information available to the potential commodity option investor.  Scienter is also
established on this record as a matter of law for the same reasons as with the
Commercial.  Precedent has  condemned materially similar representations in the
past, including specific representations on heating oil.  We hold that Defendants
acted with the requisite recklessness and departed in an extreme manner from the
ordinary standards of care. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN></P>

established with regard to the language used in the Commercial and the Seminar. 
As an additional violation of the Act, CFTC claims that these two solicitation
devices were fraudulent as a matter of law because they spoke of RJFCO's
strategy for enormous profit potential without</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM> </EM>simultaneously informing potential

Such a disclosure would have gone a long way in balancing out, for example, the
affirmative representation in the Commercial that the grain market was ripe for
"huge" profits of "200-300 percent" and to telephone RJFCO "now" because such
a corn market opportunity may "never" exist again.  It would also have done much
to counteract the assertion of "limited risk" in the Seminar.  It is misleading and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>	</EM>In its determination that there was no duty to disclose, the District Court
was influenced by the fact that there was no evidence that other firms in the
commodities industry did any worse than RJFCO and that RJFCO did not
affirmatively represent that it had an attractive success rate.  Given the highly
misleading nature of the Commercial and Seminar, we fail to discern the legal
significance of those facts in this case.  As CFTC has persuasively argued, the Act
should not foster a "race to the bottom," where liability for unquestionably
deceptive activity is based in part on whether your competitors are not doing any
better than you are.  The focus of the inquiry is not on how well or how poorly
others firms have done or even, in some circumstances, whether a firm has
affirmatively boasted about a particular win-loss record.  Rather, the judicial cross
hairs in this case fall squarely on what the investor would reasonably want to
know before deciding to commit money to a broker.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>17 C.F.R. § 33.7(f);

by stating that standard risk disclosures do not relieve a broker from the obligation
of disclosing all material facts to potential or existing options customers).  This of
course brings us back, as it should, to the underlying remedial purpose of the Act:
protecting the individual investor from being misled or deceived in the highly
risky arena of commodities investment.  The omission of highly material

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	I write separately only to underscore the extent of the misrepresentations
committed by the defendants and to make a broader point about "clarity" - the two
issues most troubling the dissent.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	One particular passage in the dissent contains the essence of the dispute in
this case: "The fact of the matter is, in options, you are either going to lose big or
win big - that is why brokerage firms like RFJCO can advertise potential profits of
up to 200 to 300% and must also warn that this type of investment involves a high
risk of loss (only investment capital should be used)."  The dissent evidently feels
that by proclaiming that only "investment capital should be used," together with an
equally generic disclaimer, a reasonable investor should be put on notice that
commodities trading is extraordinarily volatile and the risk of loss enormous. 
Recognizing that "[c]ommodities brokerage firms need to disclose both the
potential and risks involved in options trading," the dissent concludes that "RFCO
does just that - disclosing the appropriate amount of profit potential as well as the
adequate amount of risk."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The crux of my disagreement with the dissent, then, lies in the necessary
congruence between claims of potential profit and the concomitant risk involved. 
The dissent evidently believes that commodities brokerage firms can advertise
about enormous profits (replete with constant repetition, explanation points, and
satellite photographs of hurricanes) while making brief mention of the risk
involved - a discussion of risk sugar-coated with assertions about how this risk can
be "limited" while still providing "unlimited profit potential."  In my view, such
lopsided advertising is hardly a disclosure of the "the adequate amount of risk" as
the dissent proclaims.  It certainly failed to convey the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>magnitude</EM> of the risk
involved (remember:  95% of the firm's clientele lost money on the advertised
investments).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The deception regarding the substantial </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>risk</EM> was compounded with more
deception about how, precisely, the potential </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>gains</EM> were going to be realized.  The
discussion about El Ni&ntilde;o and urgency in the timing of the investment created an
heir of inevitability - as if the defendant had some special knowledge with which
to exploit an asymmetry of information in the market.  All of this is fine, the dissent
argues, so long as the advertiser skirts the line by peppering his language with
conditional language ("could" and "may") and does not say that profits are
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>absolutely</EM> inevitable.  Viewed from the perspective of a reasonable investor - not
an investment banker at Merrill Lynch or a futures specialist for ADM<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> - a
misleading expectation of investment success can certainly be made even if
conditional language is used.  This misleading picture is exactly the sort that the
defendants painted.  Perhaps the dissent would rather have a world of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>caveat
emptor</EM>: "If it is the case that investors '</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>surely</EM>' wanted to know [information about
the past success of the defendants' clients] before they invested, then why didn't
they ask?" says the dissent.  But this is not the world Congress envisioned when it
enacted the commodities laws.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The dissent further bemoans the lack of clarity in the law.  While it is
undoubtedly true that the terms chosen by Congress - "defraud" and "deceive" -
lack the precision necessary to guide behavior in all transactions, this "problem" is
a necessary byproduct of the inherent difficulty in legal drafting.  Language of
general applicability - the stuff of statutes and common law rules - is simply
incapable of conveying the entire range of permissible and impermissible conduct. 
The law is replete with nebulous phrases such as "proximate cause" and "rule of
reason."  Some cases may entail </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>post hoc</EM> judicial refinement, resulting in the
unavoidable problem of a civil defendant without notice that his precise conduct
could result in liability.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever problems may be created by nebulous rules, I am confident that in
this case, the defendants had ample notice that their heavily unbalanced portrait of
options trading - a picture far different from reality - was impermissible.  When an
investor seeks to invest his money, he is principally concerned with two factors:
return and risk.  A rational investor with no peculiar aversion to risk would be
indifferent between having $5 and a one-in-ten chance at winning $50.  Change the
risk factor to one-in-eighty and the bet becomes unattractive even to the most risk-seeking individual.  The defendants in this case knew that by trumpeting enormous
returns and downplaying the risk involved, a reasonable (if unsophisticated)
investor would be enticed to make a bet that he would not otherwise make were the
full picture disclosed.  As the majority opinion points out, "it is misleading and
deceptive to speak of 'limited risk' and '200-300' percent profits without also
telling the reasonable listener that the overwhelming bulk of firm customers lose
money."  Don't make an active attempt to instill in the investor a grossly inaccurate
picture of the risk-to-reward ratio.  That is the rule in this case  - a rule I find to be
abundantly clear.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">WILSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">I am troubled by the majority's holding, because it provides no useful guidance to
commodities brokerage firms as to how to bring their solicitation and advertising
activities into compliance with the law.  Our case law already contains a confusing
and vague definition of what constitutes "fraud" under the Commodities Exchange
Act (CEA) and Commission Rule 33.10; the majority's opinion only adds to the
uncertainty of this body of law.  On this record, I would have found that R.J.
Fitzgerald &amp; Co. (RJFCO) was not involved in fraudulent solicitations, nor did
they attempt to cheat, defraud, or deceive clients under Commission Rule 33.10.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Nor does RJFCO's promotional seminar focus on anticipated, historical
seasonal trends.  In fact, the seminar script focuses on unanticipated trends such as
abnormal weather phenomena (such as Hurricane Andrew, a drought, and floods),
political conditions (specifically August of 1990 and the impending Gulf War),
and new technical, hypothetical models (in which "[t]echnical analysts use trading
volume and price study along with charts or computer programs to identify and
project trends in the market").  Even when the script discusses the potential for
profit in the heating oil market, RJFCO does not claim that the fluctuations in the
demand for heating oil in the summer and winter will increase or decrease the
price of an option or futures.  Instead, the seminar focuses on unexpected events
that may affect supply, such as storage facilities being depleted, pipelines being
destroyed in Colombia and Northern Iran, and political events, such as the
President of the United States dispatching the USS Nimitz to the Middle East.</SPAN></P>

that profits on options (the specific type of investment they were promoting) are
proportionally related to the cash market."  However, stating that profits on
options is proportionally related to the cash market is not necessarily fraud.  In
fact, it is only when the AP asserts a one-for-one or greater correlation between
profits and movements in the cash price of the commodity that fraud exists.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See

example.  The Chicago Board of Trade's options manual explains that "a one-cent
change in the futures price would result in only a half-cent change in the option
premium."  Therefore, when RJFCO explains in its script that by using an option,
a twenty-two cent move in heating oil "could be 50-75% of the profit that the
future would have earned," RJFCO is assuming that a one-cent change in the
futures price would result in only a half-cent change in the futures price.  As the
equation concludes, the script provides: "Now remember that profit is on a futures
contract, and if you had a less aggressive option, because you want limited risk so
you would receive </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>50%</EM> of that profit - 46200 divided by 2 equals $23,100."

disclosures provided by RJFCO in the instant case.<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In its television commercial,
RJFCO attempted to explain the risk to potential customers in four separate ways. 
The first, most obvious risk disclosure statement made by RJFCO was the
statement found on the bottom one-fourth of the screen, which was kept on the
screen for forty-five of the sixty seconds of the commercial's running time.  This
statement, displayed in bold capital letters directly above RJFCO's phone number,
provided: "OPTIONS INVESTING INVOLVES A RISK OF LOSS.  MINIMUM
ACCOUNT $5,000."  Any viewer who jotted the phone number down would have
seen the prominent risk disclosure statement displayed above the number.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The second disclosure statement flashed on the screen three seconds after
the commercial began.  It provided in bright yellow letters: "The preceding were
hypothetical mathematical samples of leverage in the Commodity Options
Market."  This disclosure clarifies the point that RJFCO's prediction was based
upon a hypothetical that is not guaranteed to come true.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Third, and perhaps most important, the commercial is filled with conditional
language - nothing is guaranteed.  RJFCO is equivocal in its advertising - none of
the language in the commercial suggests that El Ni&ntilde;o </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>will definitely</EM> affect the corn
market as predicted and that customers </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>will </EM>receive huge profit.  Rather, the
following conditional statements were made: "[El Ni&ntilde;o's] effect on world crops
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>could </EM>mean huge profits in the grain markets."  "[C]onditions </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>may </EM>exist for profits

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	And finally, in the middle of the commercial, the announcer changes his tone
(the voice drops) and we hear, "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>[o]ption investing involves a high risk of loss and
only risk capital should be used</EM>."  The concurring opinion suggests that this
disclosure is inadequate to state the risk.  How much more warning is required than
a disclosure that the investment is a "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>high risk</EM>"?   This flagrant risk disclosure
statement, which is hardly brief within the format of the commercial, combined
with the "RISK OF LOSS" statement conspicuously prominent on the screen
throughout almost the entire commercial, the other statement explaining RJFCO's
mathematical formula, and the conditional language placed throughout the
commercial, effectively and sufficiently discloses the magnitude of risk involved.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	As for the promotional seminar, once again I find that there is an adequate
amount of risk disclosure.  One need only compare the seminar with the National
Futures Association's (NFA's) manual<A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> to see that RJFCO thoroughly disclosed
risk according to the NFA's suggestions.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	For example, RJFCO's promotional seminar provides: "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">In contrast to futures,
options on futures allow investors and risk managers to define risk and limit it to
the loss of a premium paid for the right to buy or sell a futures contract, while still
providing the buyer with unlimited profit potential."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">The NFA manual provides: </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">For the individual who has a price opinion (that a particular futures
price will change by at least some given amount in a certain direction
within a specific period of time), buying options offers the
opportunity to realize substantial profits with a predefined and limited
risk.  The maximum an option buyer can lose - should events prove
him wrong about the direction, extent or timing of the price change -
is the premium paid for the option plus commissions and other
transaction costs.<A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The majority takes exception to the following assertions regarding unlimited
profit potential and limited risk in options found in RJFCO's seminar: "If you are
highly aggressive and looking for unlimited profit potential as well as unlimited
risk than [sic] it would be the futures.  But most would like something less
aggressive, something offering unlimited profit potential but limited risk-option
trade."  The NFA manual confirms this for it provides: "[U]nlike an option which
has limited risk, a futures position has potentially unlimited risk." </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Now, if the "limited risk with unlimited profit potential" had been "recited
repeatedly as a sales inducement," then these true statements could have become
fraudulent in that the representation begins to "inflate the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>likelihood</EM> of profit while
minimizing the risk of loss." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM> In re Staryk,</EM> [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 45,809.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">  That, however, is simply not the case here - the
seminar does not overemphasize profit and downplay risk of loss.  Rather, the
introduction to the seminar provides, "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">These markets are risky - we want you to go
away with ideas on how to limit your risk but still be positioned to take advantage
of the volatility that not only make them exciting but potentially very profitable</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">." 
RJFCO actually mentions loss </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>first</EM>, noting how options on futures contracts can
limit this risk, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>then</EM> mentions potential profit (not guaranteed or probable
profit).  Practically every affirmative representation on profit is counterbalanced
with a risk warning.  ("Past price action can provide you with clues to future action. 
The market is anticipatory, and you can see price movement first in the chart for the
day."  The next paragraph then warns: "Chart signals, just like fundamental news
can be misleading.  You should have structure in you[r] approach to the markets.") </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Since I find no misleading or deceptive statements made by RJFCO in its
commercial or seminar, there is no need to examine scienter and materiality. 
However, it bears mentioning that the majority found RJFCO to have "acted
recklessly with regard to the statements aired on television."  The majority based
this recklessness </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">on the fact that this Court and the CFTC have previously condemned
attempts to attract customers by: (1) linking profit expectations on
commodities options to known and expected weather events, seasonal
trends, and historical highs; (2) suggesting that the commodities
market can be correctly timed to generate large profits; and (3)
substantially inflating option profit expectations while downplaying
risk of loss.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">I find no prior precedent supporting these contentions.  At the most, these
statements are oversimplifications of prior cases.  Linking profit expectations on
commodities options to known seasonal trends is only fraud if the AP "almost
guarantees profits," as in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Sidoti</EM>, or "distorts the likelihood of profit," as in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>In re
JCC,</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Inc</EM>.  Suggesting that the commodities market can be correctly timed to
generate profits is not necessarily fraud when, as stated in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>In re Staryk</EM>, "[i]t is only
when unexpected events occur, including higher or lower than expected demand
for gasoline, that an option may become profitable." [1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 43,931.  And the majority's buzz phrase,
"substantially inflating option profit expectations while downplaying risk of loss,"
is much too vague and abstract a standard to be of any use to commodities
brokerage firms who wish to advertise their services in the future.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The difficulty with the current standard for commodity options fraud is that
Rule 33.10 is too vague.  According to the majority opinion, in order to establish a
fraud claim in an enforcement action under the CEA, the CFTC must prove: "(1)
the making of a misrepresentation, misleading statement, or a deceptive omission;
(2) scienter; and (3) materiality."<A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Therefore, much of the case law from this
standard has been both arbitrary and conflicting.  Additional guidelines must be
introduced to further clarify the elements of fraud under Rule 33.10.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Courts have had the most difficulty in determining what constitutes a
material misrepresentation or a material omission.  According to the majority
opinion, "whether a misrepresentation has been made depends on the 'overall
message' and the 'common understanding of the information conveyed.'"  As for
materiality, a statement is considered material if "there is a substantial likelihood
that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment
decision."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM> Saxe v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.</EM>, 789 F.2d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 1986). 
Unfortunately, Rule 33.10 and case law do not provide adequate guidance to either
the CFTC or commodity futures brokerage firms. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	While every claim of commodities fraud must be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis under the existing standard, a more specific interpretation of the elements
under Rule 33.10 would create a standard whereby "material misrepresentations or
material omissions" would be more readily discernible.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	What constitutes a "material misrepresentation"?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	(1) The most obvious material misrepresentations are outright falsehoods
told by brokerage firm APs and sales staff to prospective or current customers. 
Examples of blatant material misrepresentations include promising to open a
trading account and not doing so, reporting erroneous account balances, or making
unlawful trades in a customer's account without his or her authorization.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See
CFTC v. Muller</EM>, 570 F.2d 1296, 1300-01 (5th Cir. 1978) (finding evidence
sufficient to support an injunction because AP lied concerning opening of bank
account and supplied fictitious options trade statements).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>  </EM>A material
misrepresentation also occurs if an AP lies about the amount of profits earned, or
losses accrued, in a customer's trading account.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See</EM>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>CFTC v. Rosenberg</EM>, 85 F.
Supp. 2d 424, 447 (D.N.J. 2000) (finding fraud because the AP reported trading
profits when no profits had been earned and failed to report losses on trades he was
not authorized to make).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	(2) A material misrepresentation that is not patently obvious, but just as
damaging, exists when a brokerage firm deliberately overstates profit potential and
conceals the possibility of loss.  Any prediction or recommendation must have a
reasonable basis in fact and should be explicitly labeled just that - a prediction and
not a guarantee.  A statement regarding potential profits that could be earned
should not be considered a material misrepresentation or misleading statement if it
is possible that these projected earnings could realistically occur.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	For example, RJFCO informed customers of the potential for profits up to 
300% if the El Ni&ntilde;o atmospheric disturbances occurred as projected.  If this profit
potential was attainable, and RJFCO compiled significant research which
suggested climactic conditions created by the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon could create
drought and thereby increase the price of grain due to its scarcity, then RJFCO's
marketing strategy did not represent a material misrepresentation.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Existing case law reflects situations, unlike RJFCO, where other firms made
unwarranted profit predictions which were considered to be inherently fraudulent 
due to an absence of technical research or proof to back up these claims.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	(3) Also, any claim about a brokerage firm's past trading record or an AP's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a brokerage firm must disclose to potential and current
customers the amount of risk inherent in commodity futures and options trading. 
However, an undefined, grey area exists between no disclosure and full disclosure. 
If  there is no mention of risk on the part of the brokerage firm, then a material
misrepresentation exists - options trading is a risky business, and customers need
to be told about the possibility of losing their entire investment.  The mandatory
risk disclosure statement required by the CFTC puts the customer on notice of the
risks of trading; however, in some instances this disclosure statement is
contradicted by oral representations made by APs who tell customers to disregard
this statement.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See Clayton Brokerage Co. of St. Louis</EM>, 794 F.2d at 580</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>In re JCC,

sufficient enough to inform the Pucketts of the risks involved because Dr. Puckett,
an educated and successful businessman who had traded securities for more than
thirty years, was capable of understanding the risk disclosure statement, and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Therefore, in order to avoid any misunderstanding or charges of
misrepresentation, it would be preferable for brokerage firms to err on the side of
caution and provide both written and oral disclosure statements to potential

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The majority implies in its opinion that RJFCO had a duty to disclose its
previous track record to prospective customers.  However, the majority fails to
point to any prior authority that suggest that there is a specific affirmative duty on
the part of a commodities brokerage firm to disclose its prior track record.  The
cases in the majority opinion suggest that a duty to disclose arises </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>only</EM> if the firm's
statements would be misleading or deceptive if it did not disclose its track record. 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc.</EM>, 256 F.3d 1194, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (We recognize
a duty to disclose when "a defendant's failure to speak would render the
defendant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>own</EM> prior speech misleading or deceptive"); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Rudolph v. Arthur

disclose") (emphasis added)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">.  Simply put, there is no mandatory duty to disclose.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	The majority argues that a reasonable investor would "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>surely</EM>" want to know 
how many RJFCO investors had lost money, and, therefore, it was RJFCO's duty to
tell them.  If it is the case that investors "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>surely</EM>" wanted to know this information
before they invested, then why didn't they ask?  This is not a case where the APs
misrepresented the firm's track record or lied about successes in the past.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>See
Modlin v. Cane</EM>, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 28,059
at 49,549-50 (CFTC Mar. 15, 2000) (The AP told customers "his method of trading
was successful" and was "the key to making money," and "that he would jump into
the East River if he was unable to generate a profit.").  RJFCO never made any
bold misrepresentations regarding its prior track record and, therefore, was under
no duty to disclose its record.  </SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Commodities brokerage firms need to disclose both the profit potential and
risks involved in options trading.  RJFCO does just that - disclosing the
appropriate amount of profit potential as well as the adequate amount of risk.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Trading options on futures contracts is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>inherently risky</EM>.  The fact of the
matter is, in options, you are either going to lose big or win big  - that is why
brokerage firms like RJFCO can advertise potential profits of up to 200 to 300%
and must also warn that this type of investment involves a high risk of loss (only
risk capital should be used).   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Admittedly, under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Sidoti</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>In re JCC, Inc.</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Bishop</EM>, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>In re Staryk</EM>, the
standard for fraud is vague.  However, these cases at least provide a sensible set of
guidelines for brokerage firms to follow in designing their solicitations and
advertising programs.  Essentially, these cases suggest that brokerage firms must
not misrepresent or guarantee profits, nor minimize the degree of loss.  However, in
this case, the majority has extended the standard to apply to a situation where a
firm did not misrepresent or guarantee profits and in fact disclosed the amount of
risk involved.<A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  And the majority opinion simply fails to offer any useful guidance
to actors in this area of the law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 12pt">	Commodities brokerage firms should be on the alert - this decision may
make it difficult to advertise and solicit business in the future.  It is uncertain what
subsequent advertising language may "overemphasize profit and downplay risk of
loss."  I dissent.
