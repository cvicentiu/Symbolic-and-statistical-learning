<p class="wallacepara">TONY JONES: Back now to our interview with the Health Minister Tony Abbott.<BR><BR>And as you've heard, the Labor Party has the backing of more than 40 per cent of the private hospital sector for it's Medicare Gold plan.<BR><BR>The principle backer is Francis Sullivan, the chief executive of Catholic Health Australia which operates about a quarter of the nation's private hospitals.<BR><BR>It turns out much of the plan is Mr Sullivan's brainchild.<BR><BR>And what's more, he tried to interest both sides of politics in the idea.<BR><BR>So, is this the one that got away from Mr Abbott, or just a hoax as the Prime Minister claims?<BR><BR>A short time ago we spoke to the Health Minister about Medicare Gold.<BR><BR>And the breakup of the country's biggest pornography ring.<BR><BR>And, as forecast earlier, we also asked him about his recent meeting with the head of the Catholic Church, Archbishop Pell.<BR><BR>Tony Abbott, thanks for joining us.<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT, HEALTH MINISTER: Good evening, Tony.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: First to the story that's dominating news coverage late today - the widespread pornography arrests around the country including married men with children, teachers, doctors, policemen, and owners of child care centres.<BR><BR>The AFP says it's just the tip of the iceberg.<BR><BR>People are inevitably going to be asking what's going wrong, why is this happening, is there something wrong with your society?<BR><BR>What do you say?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: I think they're very fair questions and plainly there is a dark side.<BR><BR>I guess, first of all, we have to do our best to track down this kind of thing, to bring people who are peddling this kind of material and who are abusing children in this way to justice.<BR><BR>But also to try to rededicate ourselves to the ordinary humane and decent values our society.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: There surely will be issues here for the Federal Government, aren't there - regulating the Internet a possibility.<BR><BR>The restriction or the monitoring of paedophiles crossing state borders.<BR><BR>A lot of issues for Commonwealth Governments?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Certainly there are and I think Chris Ellison and Phil Ruddock are pretty much on top of it.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: All right, let's move on.<BR><BR>Labor's Medicare Gold goal, Francis Sullivan, chief executive of Catholic Health Australia, he says he took this idea to both sides of politics, did he come to you and talk to you about it?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Francis dropped off a package of material about six weeks ago, from memory.<BR><BR>I had a look at it.<BR><BR>I thought, look, it's a cute idea, but it's going to be very difficult to make it work in practice and that's the problem with Medicare Gold, it's undeliverable and unsustainable.<BR><BR>Labor's costings are all over the place and we just don't have the hospital beds, we just don't have the doctors and nurses and in the end Labor hasn't put the dollars into this to make it work.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Did you sit down and talk to Francis Sullivan, though, because he says the beds are available, he says, in fact, that Catholic health Australia from day one make more than 6,000 beds available?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, they must have a lot of empty beds at the moment.<BR><BR>I don't know how they're covering their costs if they've got 6,000 empty beds available at this present time.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Well don't you trust what he's saying?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well no, but it's an obvious question.<BR><BR>If they've got 6,000 beds available now, how on earth are they covering their costs, but the other point I make, Tony, is that if this is such a good idea, why aren't the state Labor governments using the private hospital system already to clear their waiting lists?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Well if it's such a good idea, why didn't you come up with it?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: But I don't think it is good idea because it won't work.<BR><BR>As I said, I don't believe there are the beds.<BR><BR>Certainly they're aren't the doctors or the nurses because it's not - it's all very well to have a bed but you've got to have someone whose able to deliver the services but then there just aren't the dollars in there.<BR><BR>Now, a conservative estimate says that the total hospital costs of the over 75s of Australia are $4 billion a year.<BR><BR>All Labor's committing to this is a gross cost of about $1.7 billion, so, at the very least there appears to be a $2 billion funding hole in this, and if Labor was serious about all this, if they thought that their figures added up they would have submitted this policy to the Treasury for costing and as of this afternoon..<BR><BR>TONY JONES: They say they're going to submit it to Treasury for costing.<BR><BR>They also say that the costings, roughly, if you look at their figures over two years it must be more than $1.5 billion a year, so that's the amount of money they're committing per year, $1.5 billion for new beds for hospitals.<BR><BR>Why can't the Government match that sort of spending for new beds for hospitals, to end waiting lists?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Yeah, but they have said that the total hospital costs of all over 75s will be taken up by the Federal Government.<BR><BR>So, the Federal Government is going to replace State spending on hospital beds for over 75s.<BR><BR>It's going to replace private health insurance spending on hospital beds for over 75s, and in addition, it's going to give private hospital style coverage and private health insurance-style coverage to all the over 75s who don't already have it.<BR><BR>Now, this is a gargantuan undertaking and the idea that you can do this with just $1.5 or $1.7 billion both of new spending, it just doesn't add up.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: It doesn't add up to you or you say it doesn't add up.<BR><BR>What if it does add up to the $1.23 million over 75s in the country, many of them in marginal seats, even if you dispute the figures, would you agree that this could be a political coup?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, I think that people understand that every freebie has to be paid for.<BR><BR>Now I'm sure if someone came along and said to people, "Would you like completely free treatment, absolutely when you want it with all the choice in the world?"<BR><BR>People would say, "That sounds like a nice idea," But like all nice ideas it has to be doable.<BR><BR>It's very easy for people to come in and make big promises but in this political equivalent of a pyramid selling scheme and I don't think over 75s are going to buy it.<BR><BR>Just because people are old doesn't mean they're silly and they're not going to buy this con job.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Your problem is that the people running the private sector seem to be buying this idea.<BR><BR>One after the other today they've come on board with it?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, I've spoken to people at very senior levels in both Affinity and Ramsay, which are the two biggest health care groups and they're very sceptical about this.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Are you aware that the head of Affinity today went on the '7:30 Report' and has backed the plan?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: What he said was - he said that he's pleased that Labor has finally accepted that there is a role for private hospitals in reducing public hospital waiting lists but he wants to see the detail and he doesn't believe that there is the spare capacity in the system, particularly the doctors and the nurses to make this thing work.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Mr Sullivan is saying that most private hospitals, that's Francis Sullivan, most private hospitals operate at 75 per cent of capacity, that's what he's saying.<BR><BR>If he's right, Labor has hit a potential solution here to these crippling waiting lists.<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: But it's not enough just to have the beds, although certainly I don't know whether too many other operators are running with the kind of excess capacity that it seems Francis's organisation is, but it's not enough just to have beds, you've also got to have doctors and nurses and that's the big problem.<BR><BR>Where are the doctors to deliver all this?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Well, why is it that the private sector operators - here's another one, Health Scope Australia, they're now backing Labor.<BR><BR>That gives them more than 40 per cent of the private sector already backing their plan.<BR><BR>If it can't be done, why are they backing it?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, they're not backing the plan.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: That's what they say, though.<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: They're saying that they are prepared to consider an offer and what I'd like to know, what I think the rest of the people in this sector would like to know, is exactly what is Labor putting on the table.<BR><BR>How much is going to pay, it's this indexation formula, what's it going to cover, does it really mean that people can dispense with their private cover and if Labor really did believe that all of this was doable.<BR><BR>Why didn't they give the policy to Treasury today for costing?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Well, as I said before, it appears they are going to give it - <BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Yeah, the day before the election, that's what they'll do.<BR><BR>They're plainly stalling on all of this because they know that their figures don add up.<BR><BR>This is pie in the sky stuff.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: The PM says Medicare Gold will put pressure on waiting lists for other age groups.<BR><BR>Do you still maintain that?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Obviously if you've only got a certain amount of supply and you suddenly put the over 75s at the front of the queue, for everyone else the queue is going to be much longer.<BR><BR>That stands to reason.<BR><BR>That's simple logic.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Are you worried then that too much of the nation's medical resources under this plan will be spent on keeping older, elderly patients, patients over the age of 75 alive?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, obviously we want a good deal for everyone, we want a good deal for everyone, but we don't want people to be taken in by false promises.<BR><BR>We don't want false promises being made in this election and the trouble is this looks like a con job and I think that the older people of Australia and the younger people of Australia, are more than capable of seeing through a hoax.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Once again, as more and more of the private sector comes on board, though, won't that erode your argument?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well I don't think that it will.<BR><BR>One of the other things which hasn't been highlighted today but which I think people are starting to twig to, is that if the Labor Party is delivering the benefits of private health insurance for everyone who's turned 75, why would lifetime health cover have an impact.<BR><BR>Why would anyone go into private health insurance when they're young so they've got it when they're old if you get it automatically when you're old, so this is going to lead to a collapse - <BR><BR>TONY JONES: Labor's saying in fact that will save people money and save the health insurance industry a large sum of money because that group which puts in 5 per cent of the money into the insurance company takes out 23 per cent?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: That's what they're saying, Tony, but what credibility do they have?<BR><BR>Now we all know that Mark Latham has previously spoken of private health insurance rebates as being the maddest piece of public policy ever to go through the parliament.<BR><BR>We all know that basically they don't like the private sector, we all know that what they really want to do is to impose increasing controls on the health system at large and I just don't believe that people can swan in, make these kinds of grand promises, not demonstrate where the doctors are coming from, not demonstrate where the nurses are coming from.<BR><BR>They don't even know how many over 75s there are on the existing public hospital waiting lists so how can they be taken seriously on this.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Tony Abbott on another matter, have you met Archbishop Pell during the election campaign?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Not that I can recall.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Not that you can recall, because we believe that you've had at least one meeting with him quite recently?<BR><BR>You don't recall that?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, when?<BR><BR>Where?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: At the presbytery in Sydney.<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Ah, actually now that you do mention it, I did met with Cardinal Pell.<BR><BR>So what?<BR><BR>Why shouldn't I meet with Cardinal Pell?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Why couldn't you recall meeting him, I think, 10 days ago?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Look, whenever it was, so what?<BR><BR>Why shouldn't I meet Cardinal Pell.<BR><BR>Cardinal Pell is a fine man.<BR><BR>He made a very good statement the other day about the Labor Party's policy, why shouldn't I meet with him?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Well, the reason we're asking about this, obviously, because your behind-the-scenes activities in the '98 election were quite renowned and I'm wondering is there any possibility that in your discussions with Cardinal Pell which you couldn't recall a moment ago - in those discussions did you actually bring up the issue of private schools?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Nup.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Not at all?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Nup.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: What issues were discussed?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Well, Tony, I may well have been going to confession to Cardinal Pell, I may well have been seeking pastoral counselling from Cardinal Pell.<BR><BR>What's so sinister about that?<BR><BR>Cardinal Pell is one of the greatest churchmen that Australia has seen.<BR><BR>I am a very imperfect Catholic.<BR><BR>Why shouldn't I go and seek counsel?<BR><BR>Why shouldn't I go and trespass on the time occasionally of someone like Cardinal Pell.<BR><BR>If you spent more time with Cardinal Pell, your life might be more interesting.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: I haven't spent any time at all with Cardinal Pell as it turns out, but that's beside the point.<BR><BR>You're a political operative and the question is not whether he gave you counselling but whether you gave him counselling because only a short time after your visit out came this letter signed by two Archbishops condemning Labor's education policy?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: So you think that I put words into the mouth not only of Cardinal Pell but of Archbishop Jensen?<BR><BR>TONY JONES: I'm simply asking whether that was a matter of your conversations which a moment ago you didn't recall?<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: That's a bizarre suggestion.<BR><BR>TONY JONES: Tony Abbott, we'll have to leave it there, thank you very much for joining us tonight.<BR><BR>TONY ABBOTT: Thanks.</p>
