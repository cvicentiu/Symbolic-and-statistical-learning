<p class="article">Tony Abbott the Federal Health Minister should be transferred to a less taxing ministry as he seems to be having a great deal of difficulty in coming to grips with the complexity of the health portfolio.  His Medicare &quot;Minus&quot; package marks the end of Medicare as a universal health care delivery system.  His much vaunted safety net has so many holes in it, that a pregnant sperm whale could fall through one of the holes. <br /><br /> Instead of concentrating his efforts on ensuring that all Australians have access to health care services, he seems to be more interested in propagating his religious fundamentalist view points to a community that long ago tired of fire and brimstone sermons.  Abbott's elevation by Howard to the Health portfolio has given him the opportunity to use the substantial resources of the Health department to pursue his ideological obsession to remould society in his own image. <br /><br /> Australia doesn't need religious zealots who want to impose their will on people heading government departments.  It needs men and women who are willing to work with the people they represent to provide much needed services to a community that is crying out for these very same services. Abbott has succeeded in destroying the single most important innovation since the introduction of pensions Medicare.  The public hospital system lurches from crisis to crisis as he pontificates about the country's morals. He is unsuited for the current portfolio and should, for the good of the Australian people, resign his commission. <br /><br /> Abbott seems to be both unwilling and incapable of coming to grips with the important health care issues of the day.  His diversion into an intellectual cul de sac of his own making, is an indication that he does not understand how important an issue 'affordable health care' is to most Australians.  If I were John Howard, I'd give him his marching orders today.</p>
