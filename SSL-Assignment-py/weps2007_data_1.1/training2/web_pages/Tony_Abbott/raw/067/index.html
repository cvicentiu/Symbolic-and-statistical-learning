<H1>Beyond Ideology</H1>

<H2>by Tony Abbott MP</H2>

<H2>January 6, 2001</H2>

<B CLASS=RED>This is the text of a speech given by 
Tony Abbott, Liberal Member for Warringah and Federal Minister for Workplace Relations, to the Young Liberal Federal Conference.  In the speech, Abbott discusses the relationship between the liberal and conservative wings of the Liberal Party of Australia.</B><P>

<IMG SRC="abbott.jpg" ALT="Tony Abbott, Minister for Workplace Relations" align=left hspace=10 vspace=5>

The
            Centenary of Federation should be an opportunity to celebrate what
            it means to be an Australian, to reflect on the achievements and
            disappointments of the past century and to consider how we can build
            on our strengths to improve the life of the nation in the years
            ahead.&nbsp;
            <P>It’s
            a curious fact that no significant Labor figure was a prominent
            Federation Father. The Labor Party suspected that the Federation
            project was an imperialist and capitalist plot – a bourgeois hoax,
            in Manning Clark’s phrase. Even so, the Centenary year will
            witness the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first meeting of the
            Federal Labor Caucus, a day before the anniversary of the first
            sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament on May 9, 1901. It would only
            be human nature for this to elicit another burst of Labor
            self-congratulation as the true keeper of the sacred flame of
            justice, compassion and concern for the underdog in Australian
            society.
            <P>Edmund
            Burke once defined a political party as people working for the
            national interest according to a particular principle on which they
            all agreed. The basic principle on which the Labor Party was founded
            was greater equality between masters and servants. The essential
            principle animating the Federation Fathers (whether conservative
            protectionists or liberal free traders, they mostly ended up in the
            first version of an Australian liberal party within a decade) was
            citizens’ greater freedom to pursue their individual destinies
            within the framework of a new nation.
            <P>Political
            principles generally serve better as ideals than imperatives. The
            most ardent libertarian would accept that a certain amount of
            equality (such as equality before the law) is necessary for
            meaningful freedom. Convinced egalitarians generally concede that
            freedom is a good thing as long as no-one is too successful at
            exploiting it. An issue to ponder during the Centenary year is
            Australians’ long-standing reluctance to support equality of
            outcomes ahead of an ideal of equal opportunity and whether
            Labor’s passion for levelling down was a peculiar by-product of
            the era of robber baron capitalism. Australians sometimes admire
            zealots but find it hard to vote for them. We seem to prefer leaders
            who temper their ideals with common sense to those who proclaim a
            rigid programme based on a single over-riding idea.&nbsp;
            <P>There
            is no local equivalent of the Statue of Liberty beckoning to the
            “poor huddled masses yearning to be free”, but the way we have
            turned a penal colony into one of the free-est, fairest and most
            prosperous societies on earth society should fill Australians with
            pride. This is a year when even the most sceptical partisan should
            savour our national achievements: limited government under the Crown
            and the role of the First AIF in the victories of 1918 as well as
            the secret ballot, votes for women, and the Harvester Case.
            <P>One
            hundred years ago, Australia reputedly had the world’s highest
            standard of living. But in Australia as elsewhere, the times were
            marked by horrendous industrial accidents, rudimentary systems of
            social support as rural and agrarian communities eroded under the
            impact of drought and economic change, and shocking contrasts
            between opulence and squalor as new wealth was unevenly enjoyed. As
            always, there were those who believed that the things Australians
            had in common outweighed anything that divided us. However, those
            who wanted to fight the class war had far more ammunition to justify
            their faith in revolutionary change.
            <P>Understandably
            enough, Labor’s cheer squad has tried to create a mythology which
            depicted opponents as self-interested, dupes of vested interests, or
            supporters of economic doctrines based on the survival of the
            fittest. The year ahead should be a time for fair-minded reappraisal
            of everything that has helped to make modern Australia, including
            the Liberal Party which, in one guise or another, has governed the
            country for two thirds of its existence as a nation.&nbsp;
            <P>In
            a country where big company CEOs earn ten times the prime
            minister’s salary and where the national leader is no more than
            first among equals, no-one (at least no-one in his right mind) would
            enter politics out of thrusting self-interest. Those who enjoy
            giving orders or seek the lifestyle of the rich and famous should
            not (and mostly don’t) enter politics. Almost without exception,
            people in parliament want to do good, to help others, to advance
            long-cherished ideals and to realise a calling which is more than a
            job, a hobby, an interest or a career.
            <P>If
            values were not more important than interests, politics would
            degenerate into a sordid calculation of how to rob Peter to pay
            Paul. Of course politicians are acutely interested in political
            advantage but the notion that voters typically succumb to a form of
            bribery reveals more contempt for the electorate than for
            politicians or political parties. Australian voters are no more
            inclined than others to believe that “what’s good for General
            Motors is good for America” which is why politicians go to such
            lengths to demonstrate that sectoral policies are good for everyone
            in the long term and really a way to secure the national interest.
            <P>One
            of the most enduring calumnies against the Liberal Party is that we
            are “the party of the rich”. In a democracy, siding with the
            rich against the poor is a recipe for permanent electoral failure
            – unless everyone earning above the median income of about $35,000
            a year is judged to be “rich”. No-one would want to advantage
            people who are already doing well without, at the very least,
            idealising the creation of wealth in which case the argument is
            about competing ideals rather than competing interests. Quite apart
            from any ethical considerations, helping the rich (as opposed to
            helping the poor to become rich) is hardly going to win votes. As a
            political strategy, “soak the poor” makes even less sense than
            its opposite. The Labor Party, in fact, has always been much more
            effective at playing interest group politics but only because it’s
            been able to proclaim a secular equivalent of “blessed are the
            poor”.
            <P>During
            the 1980s, and particularly after John Hewson became Liberal leader
            in 1990, unsympathetic commentators claimed that the party was
            divided between “conservative liberals” in the pragmatic
            tradition of Bob Menzies and doctrinaire free-market liberals
            harking back to 19<sup>th</sup> century social Darwinism. Hewson, in
            fact, was one of Australian politics’ rare visionaries, prepared
            to challenge the power of vested interest, inertia and force of
            political habit with what he believed to be right. As the ultimate
            realisation of much of the Fightback! agenda shows, Hewson’s
            intellectual drive has left a lasting political legacy.
            <P>The
            unfairness of Labor’s critique at that time is demonstrated by the
            fact that the achievements of the Hawke Government (financial
            de-regulation, a floating exchange rate, tariff cuts and
            privatisation) mostly amounted to adopting the Liberal Party’s
            policy agenda (if not necessarily its constant practice in
            government). Since 1983, the Accord has been the biggest policy
            initiative to originate entirely within the ALP – and the Keating
            Government all-but-reformed it out of existence under constant
            intellectual pressure from the then Opposition. Between 1983 and
            1996, the Liberal Party was the most effective back seat driver in
            Australian political history because of its willingness to entertain
            and debate new ideas which subsequently became political orthodoxy.
            <P>Still,
            the success of a political party is not generally determined by its
            ability to devise new policy but by its ability to represent values,
            ideals and instincts which touch people’s hearts. Successful
            political leadership makes vigorous use of new ideas but is
            ultimately “beyond ideology” because it involves winning allies
            as much as winning arguments. John Howard’s success since 1995 has
            rested on the fact that the ideological tags Labor has tried to pin
            on him just won’t stick.
            <P>Howard
            has perceived and addressed the party’s chief historical failing
            which has been too few ideals rather than too few ideas. He has
            tackled the moral deficit as well as the budget deficit. John
            Maynard Keynes famously proclaimed the power of ideas over vested
            interests even in the case of “practical men who believe
            themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences”.
            By any standards, this has been a government of ideas but Howard has
            ensured that we cannot be portrayed, in Keynes’ imagery, as “the
            slaves of some defunct economist” rather than practical problem
            solvers.
            <P>Keynes
            also quipped that when circumstances changed, he changed his mind.
            Political parties need to change their policies but keep their
            principles. They also need to be wary of “absolutising” any of
            them. They must understand how consistency can become “the
            hobgoblin of tiny minds”, that it’s possible to have too much of
            a good thing and the extent to which unintended consequences
            dominate human interaction. The fact that key policies and actions
            of the Howard Government make sense in terms of individualism and
            market forces but embody other values too is a strength rather than
            a weakness.
            <P>Gun
            control was the Howard Government’s most unexpected achievement
            and defies political stereotyping. Disarming the population could be
            seen as a genuflection to our British roots and a rejection of
            Americanism. It could equally be seen as a denial of people’s
            right to equality with government officials. It could be seen as a
            blow against indiscriminate violence against individuals; or as
            confirming the State’s monopoly over force. In fact, there seem to
            have been no complex rationalisations at work here – just a conviction that (outside the military) Australians
            had no possible cause to use semi-automatic weapons and a
            determination to try to prevent more massacres.
            <P>Likewise,
            the liberation of East Timor cannot be put into an ideological
            pigeonhole. It was intervention in support of fundamental human
            rights. It was an assertion of Australian power. It was action at
            the behest of the United Nations. It was a projection of Australian
            values. It was resistance to military regimes. It was support for
            armed liberation movements. There were left-wing, right-wing,
            liberal, conservative and even reactionary ways to justify
            Australia’s bid, in essence, to be a good neighbour in difficult
            circumstances. It was about as ideological as the actions of Simpson
            with his donkey.
            <P>Tax
            reform is the Government’s greatest political achievement. It was
            a radical reform, wholly different from conservative incrementalism
            where a few basic principles can be discerned in reactions to
            events. To bank on success where Hewson, Hawke and Keating had all
            failed was a huge political gamble. Tax reform might have been a
            crusade – but it can hardly have been an ideological one in any
            simple sense given that much the same policy had been supported at
            one time or another by such temperamentally and philosophically
            different leaders.
            <P>One
            of the most curious features of the Hawke/Keating years was the
            repeated spectacle of a government claiming to be of the workers, by
            the workers for the workers boasting about how it had reduced
            workers’ wages. After falling by 5 per cent between 1983 and 1996,
            the real wages of low paid workers have increased by over 9 per cent
            under the Howard Government’s more flexible wages system (and
            that’s according to ACTU figures). Paying them more is a strange
            way to attack the workers. Conversely, insisting that workers need
            to be represented by union officials in any discussion about their
            wages and conditions is a strange (and, to put it at its most
            kindly, an anachronistic) way to uphold the dignity of labour.
            <P>When
            the Government introduced Work for the Dole, all the usual suspects
            said it was “punishing the victim”. But what was supposed to be
            ideology run rampant has turned out to be an expression of the near
            universal instinct that doing something is better than doing nothing
            and that to get a fair go you’ve got to give a fair go. A policy
            which the Labor Party once called “almost evil” has turned out
            to have 91 per cent support in the general community (according to
            recent government research) and 85 per cent support among people on
            Newstart.
            <P>The
            dream of greater personal freedom is probably the Liberal Party’s
            nearest equivalent to a “light on the hill” but if it is our
            pre-eminent value it is, like the prime minister in a Westminster
            system, first among equals. It might be the value, ideal and
            instinct which commands the broadest loyalty and evokes the widest
            sympathy among Liberal Party members but it is not the only one and
            cannot always prevail. Above all, it cannot be systematised or
            converted into an ideology without losing the human context in which
            its appeal is most deeply felt.
            <P>Notwithstanding
            their frequent inability to articulate them, men and women live by
            ideals. Shared ideals and enduring values are what turn crowds into
            communities and peoples into societies and ultimately civilisations.
            They form the bonds of kinship and common purpose which constitute
            the social fabric and which allow diverse individuals to find a
            sense of place and belonging in something which transcends
            themselves.
            <P>When
            it is not an undergraduate exercise in mental gymnastics (as in
            “Is the Liberal Party really liberal or really conservative?
            Discuss”), the so-called tension between “liberals” and
            “conservatives” turns out to have far more to do with political
            jockeying than with serious philosophical conflict. Instinctive
            liberals don’t need very much appreciation of history or of real
            life to understand that no-one succeeds on his own and that freedom
            can only be achieved by an individual-in-community. It is impossible
            to be free outside a context of stability and order. Without law,
            freedom degenerates into anarchy. Similarly, anyone with a sense of
            history’s lessons learnt the hard way understands that conserving
            anything requires the freedom to adapt and evolve.
            <P>In
            a world where nothing exists in isolation and everything is
            connected, “liberalism” and “conservatism” turn out to be
            complementary values. The difference between a “liberal” and a
            “conservative” is not that one values freedom and the other
            doesn’t or even that one asserts and the other denies that freedom
            comes first. The difference between the ways liberals and
            conservatives value freedom is, perhaps, more the difference between
            love at first sight and the love which grows over time.
            <P>Internal
            debate about whether the Liberal Party is fundamentally liberal or
            conservative usually misses the real point: that the party is
            destined to be, as Howard says, a “broad church”. In retirement,
            Sir Robert Menzies recalled: “We took the name ‘Liberal’
            because we were determined to be a progressive party, willing to
            make experiments, in no sense reactionary, but believing in the
            individual, his rights and his enterprise”. But this seeming
            repudiation of conservatism follows the statement: “we were
            adopting no analogy to the Liberal Party in the United Kingdom”
            and precedes Menzies’ clear distinction between Australian and
            American usage where, he said, “the word ‘liberal’ is used in
            contra-distinction to the word ‘conservative’”.
            <P>As
            Gerard Henderson has pointed out in his history of the Liberal
            Party, sometimes Menzies sounded like a laissez-faire liberal (when,
            for instance, in his 1949 election policy speech he celebrated the
            “best people in this community…owing nothing to anybody”). At
            other times, he sounded like a Burkean conservative (such as when he
            evoked “homes material, homes human and homes spiritual” in his
            1942 “<a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/liberal/1942forgotten-people.shtml">Forgotten People</A>” broadcast).
            <P>Malcolm
            Fraser began a 1980 speech to the South Australian division of the
            party with a passage reminiscent of John Stuart Mill’s famous
            statement On Liberty. “Ours is a liberal Government holding
            liberal principles”, he declared. “It believes…that to the
            maximum extent compatible with a cohesive and stable society people
            should be free to make their own decisions concerning their lives
            and the disposal of their own resources…That is the ideal to be
            aimed for and any deviation from it requires special
            justification”.
            <P>Fraser’s
            conclusion, however, was that “once liberal institutions are
            installed in a society, a government which wishes to preserve them
            must be in some sense conservative”. Conservatism, he said,
            “stresses the need for a framework of stability, continuity and
            order, not only as something desirable in itself but as a necessary
            condition of a free society”. “The art of handling this
            tension” he declared, “of finding that creative balance between
            the forces of freedom and the forces of continuity, which alone
            allows a society to advance is the true art of government in a
            country like ours”. This conservatism, he said, was not a
            “reactionary…radical right phenomenon”, but a concern to
            preserve continuity, to ensure that hard-won gains are not
            carelessly lost, (and) to integrate elements of the old and the
            new”.
            <P>People
            who see themselves as political “liberals” and those who see
            themselves as political “conservatives” should not be
            adversaries struggling for the soul of the main non-Labor party. Not
            only do liberal and conservative political philosophies live in a
            kind of symbiosis but the presence of both traditions inside the
            party significantly broadens its electoral appeal.<P>

There is, of
            course, a difference between a conservative temperament and a set of
            conservative political values. A conservative-minded person is
            disposed to prefer the settled to the controversial, the familiar to
            the new and the least possible change necessary to remedy a problem.
            A conservative political party, by contrast, can embark on drastic
            change provided it’s designed to restore a people’s values and
            traditions. A conservative-minded person need not, for instance, be
            drawn to sport, religion or music at all but, if he is, will tend to
            prefer Test matches to one day cricket, the King James Bible to its
            successors and the Beatles to Kylie Minogue.
            <P>There
            are conservative-minded people in every political party. A
            conservative communist, for instance, might lament the decline of
            Russia and call for its restoration based on a revived understanding
            of marxist principles. A conservative member of the ALP might have
            his faith shaken every time Labor supports a new social experiment.
            In this sense, a conservative disposition, though not identical with
            political conservatism, is certainly its strong ally and a breeding
            ground for its potential supporters.<P>
			
			The
            generally happy marriage between liberal and conservative thinking
            inside the Liberal Party has been a source of intellectual vitality
            and political strength. A Liberal Party which is liberal
            conservative should have more to offer a wider range of voters than
            a Liberal Party which is just liberal.<P>
