	<p>CANBERRA - Health Minister Tony Abbott is refusing to cave in to demands for a ban on junk food ads during children&#039s programs, saying parents should simply switch off the television.<p>New research by the NSW Health Department shows there are 1.5 million overweight children in Australia and they are beginning to suffer major health problems.<p>The study, to be detailed on the ABC&#039s Four Corners program tonight, found that between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s the number of overweight children doubled, and of even more concern, the childhood obesity rate tripled.<p>Amid mounting calls for an ad ban, Mr Abbott says the solution to the childhood obesity crisis lies with parents.<p>"If the parents are foolish enough to feed their kids on a diet of Coca-Cola and lollies, well they should lift their game and lift it urgently," he told the program, to be aired tonight.<p>"The federal government doesn&#039t say to someone in the supermarket `please take that bottle of Coca-Cola&#039.<p>"No one is in charge of what goes into kids&#039 mouths except their parents."<p>Mr Abbott said ad bans would not solve the problem.<p>"If you don&#039t like the advertising on television, switch it off, as simple as that, watch the ABC," he said.<p>Kaye Mehta of the Coalition on Food Advertising to Children (CFAC) said Mr Abbott&#039s attitude showed a lack of understanding of the true pressures facing working families.<p>"I&#039m sure Tony Abbott hasn&#039t experienced whinging children around his feet at five o&#039clock in the evening, or when he&#039s trying to get a meal together," Ms Mehta said.<p>She said most parents backed a push by the CFAC for a ban on all food ads on TV during periods when children aged under 12 years were watching.<p>"All our work shows that parents want some help here, they want tighter regulations and if possible, they want ads off the TV," Ms Mehta said.<p>Dr Elspeth McInnes, a lecturer in early childhood education at the University of South Australia, said Mr Abbott&#039s advice that parents should switch off the TV was unrealistic.<p>"That&#039s if they own the TV set," said Dr McInnes, who is also convenor of the National Council of Single Mothers.<p>"If we are as a society keen to make sure we eat better then we should be regulating advertising."<p>Family First Senator Steve Fielding agreed with Mr Abbott that parents must shoulder the responsibility.<p>"The focus has to be on the parent, they have to put boundaries around their kids&#039 eating habits and parents should lead by example," he said.<p>In 2003, former minister for children Larry Anthony warned a kids&#039 marketing conference that if the industry was not responsible, the government would intervene.<p>Mr Anthony never raised the matter again.<p>The former National MP has told the ABC that at the time, he came under pressure from within government ranks to ease off - a claim disputed by Mr Abbott.<p>"I have absolutely no reason to think that he would&#039ve been (pressured)," Mr Abbott said.
