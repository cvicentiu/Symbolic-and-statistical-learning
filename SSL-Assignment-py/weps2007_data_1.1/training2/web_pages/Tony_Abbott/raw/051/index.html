                              <p>The Tony Abbott saga is absolutely fascinating. This is real life drama with an anti-climatic ending that no one could have predicted. For those who donâ€™t live in Australia, here are the facts of this fascinating â€œdays of our livesâ€?:</p>

<p>1.	Tony Abbott is the health minister in the current John Howard ministry.</p>

<p>2.	27 years ago, Tony Abbott and his then girlfriend at University of Sydney, had a baby boy together.</p>

<p>3.	Soon after his birth, the boy was given up for adoption. Both parents felt that they were too young to care for the baby. Mr Abbott was only 19 years old then.</p>

<p>4.	Last October (Oct 2004), the boy given up for adoption decided to trace his birth parents. So far, so good.</p>

<p>And now, the twists in the story start.</p>

<p>5.	Amazing fact No 1: He finds out that his birth father is now the health minister of Australia (and a possible future prime minister)! Amazing fact in itself indeed. A quick reunion is arranged between all parties involved. The story is made public in the New Year (2005).</p>

<p>6.	Amazing fact No 2: Both father and son had crossed paths many times before! This is because the son works as a sound recordist for the ABC (the Australian Broadcast Corporation, a government entity!) in Canberra (Australian capital). TV channels go berserk showing footage of Mr. Abbott giving interviews where his own son is holding the sound equipment, standing next to each other! How bizarre is that?</p>

<p>7.	Amazing fact No 3: The son is not Mr. Abbott!!! After the story is made public, another man comes forward claiming he is the father of the son! DNA tests prove it!</p>

<p>8.	Amazing fact No 4: Mr. Abbott, for the last 27 years, thought that he had given up his only son for adoption (he has three daughters now in a separate marriage) when the son wasnâ€™t his! Apparently, his girlfriend during that time had a one off stand with another student and the child was theirs.</p>

<p>It is hard not to feel sorry for Mr. Abbott. Imagine the mix bag of emotions that he has had in the last few months. First he is reunited with the son that he gave up all those years ago, and was then told after a few months that the son wasnâ€™t his to start with. This is bad enough in normal peopleâ€™s lives, but when it happens in full public glare, I can only imagine the pain.</p>

<p>To his credit, he has handled himself remarkably well. He is polished and graceful and whatever grieving he must be doing must be behind closed doors.</p>

<p>What a story! I cannot wait for the movie to come out.<br />
