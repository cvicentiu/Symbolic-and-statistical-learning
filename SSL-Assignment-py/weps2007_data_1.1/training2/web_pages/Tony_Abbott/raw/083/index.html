<div class="message">It appears Liberal party is going to erect its dream fortress(the formula to stay in power forever) on the graves of Ethnic minorities in Australia. First it was Prime Minister then it was Donna vale, after that it was would be Prime Minister (Costello) and now the sacred Christian at heart Mr Abbot who want woman not to get rid of unwanted pregnancies so that Anglo people won't become minority 50 years from now in the British Queen's own territory left in Asia-Pacific.<br><br>Blame it to the lack of agenda and poverty of thoughts to target multiculturalism and ethnic Australians or threat-perception of Mr Abbott it would not going to help him in the long run nor his party.

<br><br>I agree. Sometimes people let their guard down and show their true colours.<br><br>What does it take for senior politicians to be sacked??<br><br>John Howard - responsible for an illegal invasion of another country - should have been SACKED!<br><br>Alexander Downer - had knowledge of illegal bribes being paid by the AWB to Iraq, the same Iraq that we invaded due to the regime being corrupt and cruel - should have been SACKED!<br><br>Dana Vale - made a racist statement contributing to the spread of Islamophobia - should be SACKED!<br><br>Tony Abbott - made an obviously racist comment (in gest or not this is not acceptable for an MP) - should be SACKED!<br><br>These 4 should have been sacked for their crimes or misdemeanours! And that damn liberal friendly speaker should also be sacked for not finding what Abbott said offensive.<br><br>This country cannot afford to have racists in Parliament.</div>

<br><br>Voters only have one option, and that is to vote a Government out of office if they are not happy with them. Voters make an informed (or uninformed) decision to vote for politicians and put their trust and confidence in them. They are not and should not be responsible for a Government if they break the law or behave unacceptably while in office.<br><br>The role of an unbiased governor general should have been to vote 'no confidence' in john howard after he LIED about children overboard. And the excuse &quot;that was the information that was presented to me&quot; is not good enough. If you're the PM and you are sent a memo saying 'refugees are throwing their children overboard', you may want to ask 'really?', 'I'd like more information about the matter', instead of believing whatever nonsense you are told. <br><br>However, we all know that howard knew these were lies and went along with them for his own political purposes. Just as he's doing with the AWB scandal, evidence this morning shows that the cable alerting to dodgy business dealings by the AWB was sent to howard by the Canadian Government 6 years ago, but of course he's going to say he never saw it and had no knowledge of the issue. Which again is an out-and-out lie as Downer has already admitted to knowing about the warnings.<br><br>There must be a system where senior politicians cannot use the defences &quot;that's the information that was presented to me&quot; or &quot;I haven't been made aware of that information&quot; for serious matters. Because they (Howard in particular) use these excuses to get out of any indiscretions!<br><br>The bottom line is politicians should be accountable for the failures of their own staff or department. They should not be able to shift the blame. It's the only way to (try and) keep these pr*cks honest!<br><br>Imagine if the defence minister was sent a memo by the Indonesian Government warning of an impending attack by Jamaah Islamia, and he didn't see or act on it and an attack on Australian soil was carried out? And his excuse would be I get thousands of memos everyday and I don't have time to go through every one of them. It seems like something this extreme has to happen before even a shred of accountability is required from a politician. And even then I doubt that Downer's head would roll, he'd just weasel out of it like they always do and throw up a smokescreen and blame evil terrorist muslims that hate our way of life.<br><br><br>

<div class="message"><b>Stem cell method avoids killing embryos<br>August 24, 2006 - 9:10AM</b><br><br>A US biotechnology company has developed a new way of creating stem cells without destroying human embryos, billing it as a potential solution to a contentious political and ethical debate.<br><br>&quot;This will make it far more difficult to oppose this research,&quot; said Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology, the Alameda, California, company that reported the new method.<br><br>Stem cell researchers were impressed by the new technique's ability to produce two robust lines of stem cells without requiring the destruction of embryos, and a White House spokeswoman called it encouraging.<br><br>However, few on either side believe the new procedure would end the long-running bitter impasse over the science.<br><br>Stem cells have become a sort of holy grail for advocates of patients with a wide variety of illnesses because of the cells' potential to transform into any type of human tissue.<br><br>But the Vatican, US President George W Bush and others have argued that the promise of stem cells should not be realised at the expense of human life, even in its most nascent stages.<br><br>&quot;The science is interesting and important,&quot; said John Harris, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester in Great Britain, commenting on the biotech company's efforts.<br><br>But a representative of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops rejected the method as &quot;gravely unethical.&quot;<br><br>A number of stem cell researchers and bioethicists dismissed it as scientifically suboptimal and politically ill-advised.<br><br>&quot;This will please no one,&quot; predicted a longtime critic of the company, Glenn McGee, director of the Alden March Bioethics Institute in Albany, New York.<br><br>The new technique takes just a single cell from an early-stage embryo and uses it to seed a line of stem cells. The rest of the embryo retains the potential to develop into a healthy human.<br><br>A paper describing the method is being published online today by the British journal Nature. The journal published a similar paper by Advanced Cell Technology researchers last year demonstrating the technique's viability in mice.<br><br>Stem cell researchers complain that the new approach, though it may hold future promise, simply is not as efficient as their current method of creating stem cells. That procedure involves the destruction of embryos after about five days of development, when they consist of about 100 cells.<br><br>Those who oppose any research that destroys a biological entity with the potential for human life argue that the new procedure solves nothing, because even the single cell removed in the technique could theoretically grow into a full-fledged human.<br><br>&quot;It is widely believed that one cell of a very early embryo may separate and become a new embryo, an identical twin,&quot; said Richard Doerflinger of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.<br><br>US law currently bans federal funding of any research that harms human embryos. A White House spokeswoman said the new method's eligibility for funding could not yet be determined, &quot;but it is encouraging to see scientists at least making serious efforts to move away from research that involves the destruction of embryos.&quot;<br><br>Scientists at Advanced Cell devised a clever means of piggybacking on existing fertility treatments to avoid the creation, manipulation or destruction of embryos specifically for the production of stem cells.<br><br>The fertility procedure, known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, is used when parents want to avoid having a child with a lethal or severely debilitating birth defect. About 1,000 such procedures are performed each year in the United States.<br><br>PGD begins with in vitro fertilisation to produce numerous embryos. At a very early stage of development, when the embryos are no more than a ball of eight to 10 cells, a technician extracts a single cell from each one. The extracted cells are tested for genetic disorders, and those free of defect are then implanted in the mother in the hope that will develop.<br><br>The new stem cell production method takes a cell extracted during PGD and allows it to divide. One of the two resulting cells is genetically tested as in normal PGD; the other is cultured to encourage the development of stem cells.<br><br>&quot;It's nothing revolutionary,&quot; said Yury Verlinsky, a Chicago physician who specialises in PGD.<br><br>Advanced Cell Technology was able to produce two viable stem cell lines from a total of 16 embryos. The lines appeared to exhibit the full potential of embryonic stem cells to develop into any type of human tissue, the researchers reported, but additional study is needed to verify that.<br><br>&quot;I think this will become a standard way of producing stem cell lines,&quot; said Ronald M. Green, a Dartmouth College professor of religion who is an unpaid bioethics adviser to Advanced Cell Technology.<br><br>Embryonic stem cells have great medical potential because of their ability to transform themselves into virtually any human tissue. With further research, they might one day be used to treat patients with cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, spinal cord injuries and other ailments.<br><br><b>AP</b><br><br><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/stem-cell-method-avoids-killing-embryos/2006/08/24/1156012641398.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1" target="_blank">http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/stem-cell-method-avoids-killing-embryos/2006/08/24/1156012641398.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1</a><br><br></div>

However, it is now known that blood retrieved from the umbilical cord is a rich source of stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialized blood cells that produce all other blood cells, including blood-clotting platelets and red and white blood cells. Like donated bone marrow, umbilical cord blood can be used to treat various genetic disorders that affect the blood and immune system, leukemia and certain cancers, and some inherited disorders of body chemistry. <br><br><b>To date, more than 45 disorders can be treated with stem cells from umbilical cord blood.</b><br><br>Currently, commercial companies provide services to parents to store their newborn baby’s cord blood. Prospective parents who are considering this option should have as much information as possible to make an informed decision.<br><br><br><font color="darkblue"><b><u>What are stem cells and why are they valuable?</u></b></font><br><br><br>Blood stem cells, most often found deep in bone marrow, are the factory of the blood system. They continually make new copies of themselves and produce cells that make every other type of blood cell. Stem cells are the key to successful bone marrow transplantations (BMTs) because they continue to manufacture blood cells indefinitely.<br><br>Bone marrow transplants can be lifesaving for people with leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells) and other cancers, or for those with serious blood disorders, such as aplastic anemia, in which the body does not produce enough blood cells. Stem cells can help enhance a person’s blood producing capability and immune system that are impaired through an inherited (genetic) defect or that have been severely damaged or deliberately destroyed by cancer treatments. <br><br>At present, donated bone marrow is the most common source of stem cells.<br><br><br><font color="darkblue"><b><u>What are the advantages of stem cells from cord blood?</u></b></font><br><br>Studies suggest that stem cells from cord blood offer some important advantages over those retrieved from bone marrow. <br><br>For one thing, stem cells from cord blood are much easier to get because they are readily obtained from the placenta at the time of delivery. <br><br>Harvesting stem cells from bone marrow requires a surgical procedure, usually under general anesthesia, that can cause post-operative pain and poses a small risk to the donor.<br><br>A broader range of recipients may benefit from cord blood stem cells. These can be stored and transplanted back into the donor, to a family member or to an unrelated recipient. For a bone marrow transplant to succeed, there must be a nearly perfect match of certain tissue proteins between the donor and the recipient. When stem cells from cord blood are used, the donor cells appear more likely to “take” or engraft, even when there are partial tissue mismatches.<br><br>A potentially fatal complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD), in which donor cells can attack the recipient’s tissues, appears to occur less frequently with cord blood than with bone marrow. This may be because cord blood has a muted immune system and certain cells, usually active in an immune reaction, are not yet educated to attack the recipient. <br><br><br>A 2000 study found that children who received a cord blood transplant from a closely matched sibling were 59 percent less likely to develop GVHD than children who received a bone marrow transplant from a closely matched sibling.<br><br>The use of cord blood may make blood stem cell transplants available more quickly for people who need them. About 30,000 individuals each year are diagnosed with conditions that could be treated with a bone marrow transplant. Approximately 25 percent of these individuals have a relative who is an appropriate tissue match. While suitable donors can be located for many through national bone marrow registries, the process can take months. Donors can be located within 4 months for about 50 percent of patients. <br><br>It often is more difficult to find a bone marrow match for members of non-white ethnic and racial groups; transplants from cord blood may make timely treatment available for more of these individuals. Banked stem cells from cord blood can be more readily available, and this can be especially crucial for patients with severe cases of leukaemia, anaemia or immune deficiency who would, otherwise, die before a match can be found.<br><br>Cord blood also is less likely to contain certain infectious agents, like some viruses, that can pose a risk to transplant recipients.</div></td>

<br><br><br>And on that article goes from there ... so imagine how much Stem Cell goes to waste from just births alone&nbsp;&nbsp;(think on a World Scale), and the blood that can be used from cord blood obtained from the placenta ... instead of arguing about whether embryo's should be harvested ... all this people should look a way of setting up a Cord Blood Bank on&nbsp;&nbsp;a national scale ... much like our normal Blood Banks.<br><br>Like the article says, we use Stem Cells now from Bone Marrow which has to be a great match ... imagine a data bank of available Umbilical Cord Stem Cell Rich Blood on tap ... we would hardly be arguing about the embryo problem at all ... as it would not be needed much ... at Birth each and every one of us could have our own Stem Cells stored if we wanted to (a bank for our future health).<br></div>

<div class="message"><i>Well the Vatican says NO.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;:X<br><br><b>Vatican rejects 'ethical' stem cell breakthrough</b><br><br>The Catholic Church has rejected claims a new technique to create stem cells does not harm embryos, pouring cold water on hopes by many scientists of ending ethical uproar over their research.<br><br>A US company says it has developed a way to create the stem cells without harming the original embryo, which the Vatican holds is a fully-fledged human life. <br><br>The breakthrough technique was meant to answer critics at the papal palace, the White House and beyond, who have long argued that it was ethically reproachable to attempt to save one life by taking another. <br><br>The head of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy for Life, Bishop Elio Sgreccia, says the new method by Advanced Cell Technology fails to overcome the Church's many moral concerns. <br><br>Bishop Sgreccia says the procedure is wrong-footed from the start - experimenting with embryos is reprehensible, as is use of &quot;unnatural&quot; in-vitro embryos created at fertility clinics, like the ones the US scientists employed in their research. <br><br>He says Advanced Cell Technology then made things worse by extracting what could be a &quot;totipotent&quot; cell.<br><br>&quot;This is not just any cell, but a cell capable of reproducing a human embryo,&quot; he said. He added that, in effect: &quot;a second embryo is being destroyed&quot;. <br><br>Across the Atlantic, Richard Doerflinger, a bioethics expert with the US Conference of Bishops, has accused the scientists of &quot;killing&quot; 16 embryos during their research. <br><br>Since stem cells can develop into any kind of body tissue, medical researchers believe they can lead to tailored treatments for diseases, including cancer and diabetes. <br><br>The Advanced Cell scientists, led by Dr Robert Lanza, let its embryos grow to the 8 to 10 cell stage before removing one cell. They then grew stem cells from that single cell. <br><br>Dr Lanza says the embryos, after such a procedure, still can be implanted in women with the potential to develop normally. <br><br>&quot;For most rational people, this removes the last rational objection for opposing this research,&quot; Dr Lanza said. <br><br>Bishop Sgreccia say there is no way that Dr Lanza can ensure that embryos which had cells extracted could later go on to develop normally. <br><br>He urged them to look into other promising avenues, including adult stem cell research, accepted by the Church. <br><br>&quot;Even if it didn't damage the embryo, it's still an issue of an invasive, unjustified operation on a human being ... You're going in, taking a piece of a embryo's organism to use for yourself,&quot; he said. <br><br>-Reuters<br><br><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1725151.htm" target="_blank">http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1725151.htm</a></div>
