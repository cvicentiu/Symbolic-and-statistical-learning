          was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to begin with. Together, my mother, a
          school teacher, and my father, a returning World War II paratrooper
          pursuing his college studies, brought tons of books into our small
          house on Cliffview Road. I guess you could say that these books were
          my first introduction to the world of literature. My father was always
          writing, so the sound of the typewriter was like the background music
        of my early childhood. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
        When I was eight, we relocated to Connecticut where I finished elementary
          school and high school. I went to college at the University of Connecticut,
          majoring first in music (too hard), psychology (too many theories),
                and finally English (yes! lot and lots of books!). I graduated
                UConn with
          a bachelors degree in English Literature. After that, I traveled to
                Europe for quite a while, drank a lot of coffee, and wrote notebooks
                full of
          strange poetry. When I returned, I found work in a variety of bookstores
          and finally a library where I met my wife to be. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
        It was when I began reading bedtime stories to my children that the
            spark of writing I had had for so many years finally turned to children's
            books.
            After many failures, my first published book, <em>Danger Guys</em>, was written
            while taking a writing class with renowned children's author, Patricia
            Reilly Giff. That first book, and the series that it began, became
            the cornerstone of my writing career. Since then, I've written over
            sixty
            books for readers ages 6 to 12, including the popular fantasy saga,
            <em>The Secrets of Droon.</em></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <br>
        Over 6 million of my books have been sold worldwide, and my series
              have been translated into Italian, Spanish, Korean, French, Japanese
              and Russian.
              <em>Danger Guys</em> was named a Children's Book-of-the-Month Club Main
                Selection, and the American Booksellers Association voted <em>The
                Secrets of Droon</em>        among the &quot;Top 10 List of Books to Read while Waiting for the Next Harry
              Potter.&quot; The series was also a Main Selection of the Children's
              Book-of-the-Month Club, and is on many school and library reading lists.</font></p>

        My literary and cultural interests include the films of Preston
                Sturges, the Road pictures of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, the Marx
                Brothers,
                nearly everything John Cleese, Steve Reeves, or Kiera Knightley
                have done,
                and the writings of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, P.G. Wodehouse,
                Jules Verne,
                Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Seamus Heaney, Emily Dickinson,
                Ted Hughes, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck, <em>The Arabian
