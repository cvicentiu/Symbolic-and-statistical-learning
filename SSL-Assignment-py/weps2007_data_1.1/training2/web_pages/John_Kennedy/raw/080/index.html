          visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1961, 
          to place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. At the conclusion of 
          the ceremony President Kennedy spoke to more than 5,000 people gathered 
          in the Memorial Amphitheater. </p>
        <p class="body">President Kennedy's address began; &quot;We meet in quiet 
          commemoration of a historic day of peace. In an age that threatens the 
          survival of freedom, we join together to honor those who made our freedom 
          possible. ... It is a tragic fact, that war still more destructive and 
          still sanguinary followed [World War II]; that man's capacity to devise 
          new ways of killing his fellow men have far outstripped his capacity

        <p class="body">Eleven days prior to Kennedy's assassination he returned 
          to Arlington for the 1963 Armistice Day services. This time he did not 
          address the crowd in the amphitheater. </p>
        <p class="body">On Nov. 22, 1963, while on a campaign trip to Dallas, 
          President Kennedy was shot and killed. </p>
        <p class="body">There are only two U.S. presidents buried at Arlington 
          National Cemetery. The other is William Howard Taft, who died in 1930.</p>
        <p class="body">Though Kennedy is buried at Arlington, at the time of 
          his death, many believed that he would be buried in Brookline, Mass. 
          Woodrow Wilson was the only other president besides Taft who had been 
          buried outside of his native state and in the National Capital Region. 
          President Wilson is buried at the National Cathedral in Washington, 
          D.C. </p>
        <p class="body">The Associated Press on Nov. 22, 1963, prematurely announced, 
          &quot;President Kennedy's body will lie in state at the White House 
          tomorrow. ... There's nothing definite yet on the funeral, but it's 
          understood it will be in Boston.&quot; </p>
        <p class="body">The New York Times announced later that day, &quot;The 
          president was expected to be buried at the Kennedy family plot in Holyhood 
          Cemetery, near Brookline, Mass. He is a native of Boston.&quot;</p>
        <p class="body">Kennedy's brother-in-law and director of the Peace Corps, 
          Sargent Shriver, arrived at the White House to make tentative arrangements 
          for Kennedy's funeral. However, nothing was definite until the wishes 
          of Jacqueline Kennedy, the president's widow, were known. Her wishes 
          were stated simply, &quot;He belongs to the people.&quot; </p>
        <p class="body"><a href="JFK.html#top" class="bodyLink">Back to top</a> </p>
        <p class="body">Shriver prepared for all possibilities and had even contacted 
          Jack Metzler Sr., superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery. Metzler 
          informed Shriver that ample space was available in Arlington and that 
          the cemetery would be ready to handle the funeral. </p>
        <p class="body">The first formal statement from Mrs. Kennedy concerning 
          the burial was to model her husband's funeral after ceremonies rendered 
          for Abraham Lincoln. </p>
        <p class="body">The research on President Lincoln's funeral was done by 
          Professor James Robertson, the executive director of the U.S. Civil 
          War Centennial Commission. He contacted David Mearns, the director of 
          the Library of Congress. The two men went to the government repository 
          where the lights were inoperative because they were connected to a timer 
          switch and would only operate during the time the Library was scheduled 
          to be opened. Using flashlights they found copies of Frank Leslie's 
          Illustrated and Harper's Weekly which depicted the 1865 funeral in graphic 
          detail. Using this information, the East Room of the White House was 
          transformed to fit the description of the funeral almost a century earlier. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara felt that President 
          Kennedy should be interred on federal property so that his grave would 
          be accessible to the American people. McNamara contacted Metzler and 
          wished to see potential burial plots for the president at ANC. Three 
          plots were shown: one near the mast of the <em>USS Maine</em>, one at 
          Dewey Circle, and the third on the slope below Arlington House (Custis-Lee 
          mansion). The president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, 
          found the &quot;Maine&quot; location inappropriate and the &quot;Dewey&quot; 
          location inaccessible; however, he believed that the slope below Arlington 
          House was ideal. The final decision was Mrs. Kennedy's. After arriving 
          and viewing the gravesite below Arlington House, she nodded her approval. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">McNamara and Robert F. Kennedy returned to Arlington to 
          supervise the surveying of the area. The two men walked up the hill 
          to Arlington House. While they were there, Park Service employee Paul 
          Fugua recounted how on March 3 President Kennedy and Charlie Bartlett 
          had made an impromptu Sunday visit to the Custis-Lee mansion. He went 
          on to recall that after touring the house the president remarked that 
          the view of Washington, D.C., was so magnificent that he could stay 
          forever &#151; a statement which seemed to confirm their selection of 
          the grave site. </p>

          </span></a>Mrs. Kennedy had expressed a desire to mark the president's 
          grave with an eternal flame similar to that of the French Unknown Soldier 
          in Paris. The Washington Gas Company was contacted and a propane-fed 
          torch was selected, as it could be safely lit during the funeral the 
          following day. </p>
        <p class="body">On Nov. 25, 1963, at 3 p.m., the state funeral of President 
          Kennedy began. Earlier that day cemetery employees at Arlington, along 
          with personnel from the Military District of Washington, conducted 23 
          funerals. All were conducted with appropriate dignity and military honors. 
        </p>
        <p class="body"><a href="JFK.html#top" class="bodyLink">Back to top</a> </p>
        <p class="body">Among the mourners at Kennedy's grave site were President 
          Charles de Gaulle of France, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of the Federal 
          Republic of Germany, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and Prince Philip 
          of the United Kingdom. Overhead, 50 Navy and Air Force jets flew past 
          the gravesite followed by the president's plane, Air Force One, which 
          dipped its wing in final tribute. </p>
        <p class="body">A contingent of the Irish Guard stood opposite the grave, 
          and the Archbishop of Boston, Richard Cardinal Cushing, performed a 
          Roman Catholic committal service. The body bearers folded the interment 
          flag, and Metzler presented it to Mrs. Kennedy. She and Robert Kennedy 
          then used a torch to light the eternal flame. </p>
        <p class="body">On Dec. 4, 1963, the two deceased Kennedy children were 
          reburied in Arlington, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy from Brookline &#151; 
          who had predeceased JFK by 15 weeks &#151; and an unnamed stillborn 
          daughter from Newport, R.I. </p>
        <p class="body">The initial plot was 20 feet by 30 feet and was surrounded 
          by a white picket fence. During the first year often more than 3,000 
          people an hour visited the Kennedy gravesite, and on weekends an estimated 
          50,000 people visited. Three years after Kennedy's death, more than 
          16 million people had come to visit the Kennedy plot. </p>
        <p class="body">Because of the large crowds, cemetery officials and members 
          of the Kennedy family decided that a more suitable site should be constructed. 
          The architectural firm of John Warnecke and Associates was tasked to 
          design and build the grave area. Construction began in 1965 and was 
          completed July 20, 1967. During the period of construction, President 
          Kennedy and his two deceased children were quietly reinterred to the 
          permanent grave, and Archbishop Cushing formally blessed the new site 
          in a private service, which was attended by Mrs. Kennedy, Senators Robert 
          and Edward Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson. </p>
        <p class="body">The grave area is paved with irregular stones of Cape 
          Cod granite, which were quarried around 1817 near the site of the president's 
          home and selected by members of his family. Clover, and later, sedum 
          were planted in the crevices to give the appearance of stones lying 
          naturally in a Massachusetts field. </p>
        <p class="body">Lighted by Mrs. Kennedy during the funeral, the Eternal 
          Flame burns from the center of a five-foot circular flat-granite stone 
          at the head of the grave. The burner is a specially designed apparatus 
          created by the Institute of Gas Technology of Chicago. A constantly 
          flashing electric spark near the tip of the nozzle relights the gas 
          should the flame be extinguished by rain, wind or accident. The fuel 
          is natural gas and is mixed with a controlled quantity of air to achieve 
          the color and shape of the flame. </p>
        <p class="body">The entire site, a total of 3.2 acres, was set aside by 
          the secretary of the Army, with the approval of the secretary of defense, 
          to honor the memory of the president. The land has been retained for 
          the nation as a whole and has not been deeded to the Kennedy family. 
          The steep hillside has never been considered suitable for graves or 
          a general burial location. </p>
        <p class="body">The Kennedy family paid actual costs in the immediate 
          grave area. The government was responsible for the improvements in the 
          surrounding area that provided for the accommodation of the visiting 
          public. Funds in the amount of $1,770,000 were included for this purpose 
          in Fiscal Year 1965's Public Works Appropriation. </p>
        <p class="body">In addition, $71,026 went to Ammann and Whitney, Structural 
          Engineers, New York, N.Y. The Aberthaw Construction Company, Boston, 
          Mass., carried out the work under the supervision of the U.S. Army District 
          Engineering, Norfolk, Va. </p>
        <p class="body">On May 23, 1994, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was 
          buried next to President Kennedy. The gravesite was completed with addition 
          of her grave marker Oct. 6, 1994.
