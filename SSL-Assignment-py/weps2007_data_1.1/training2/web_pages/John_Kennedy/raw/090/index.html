<p><font color="#400040"><strong>Short Biography:</strong></font></p>

<p>John Kennedy was born in Plymouth, Indiana in 1948. When he was 7 years old
his family moved to Hammond, Indiana where John attended school from 3rd grade through his
junior year in high school. (HHS is still the Best!) In the summer of 1965 John moved to
San Jose, California where he graduated from Lincoln High in 1966. John then attended UC
Santa Barbara from 1966-1970 where he earned a B.A. degree in Mathematics. John was
accepted to start graduate work in Mathematics at UCLA in the next year, but his draft
board had other ideas. While waiting for a decision, during 1970-1971, John earned a
Secondary Teaching credential from UCSB. He was then drafted for the Vietnam War, but
instead, served as a Conscientious Objector between 1971-1973. From 1973-1975 John
attended UCLA where he earned an M.A. degree in Mathematics. John then began teaching math
at Santa Monica College in 1975. John is a co-author of two math textbooks used at SMC. He
is an avid computer programmer as evidenced by the programs and papers available in the
above download links. He is also an independent consultant and software developer
specializing in small database and imaging applications for private companies. </p>
