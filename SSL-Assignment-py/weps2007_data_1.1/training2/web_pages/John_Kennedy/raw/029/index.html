<hr>

<p>John F. Kennedy, whose ancestors came from Ireland, was the first Roman Catholic to
become President of the United States. Aged 43 at the time of his election in 1960, he was
also the youngest person ever elected to the country's highest office, although he was not
the youngest to serve in it. Theodore Roosevelt was not quite 43 when the assassination of
President William McKinley in 1901 elevated him to the presidency. Like McKinley, Kennedy
was to die at the hands of an assassin. </p>

<p>A confrontation with the Soviet Union in Berlin and the discovery of Soviet nuclear
missiles in Cuba brought the United States close to the brink of war during Kennedy's
presidency. His support of demands by blacks for equality in civil rights shook the
Democratic Party's long-standing grip on the South and tested his political leadership.
Racial integration, economics, and other issues stirred fierce antagonisms throughout the
United States. But for millions of Americans, the young president held great<br>
charm and even greater hopes, and his violent death in 1963 brought many people to tears.</p>

<p><b>Early Life</b> </p>

<p>John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb
of Boston, into a family of wealth and strong political tradition. Both his grandfathers,
Patrick J. Kennedy and John F. Fitzgerald, had been elected to public offices. Fitzgerald,
in fact, had been mayor of Boston and had served in congress. </p>

<p>Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the future president, was a financier and businessman who
built one of the great private fortunes of his time. He was active in politics, too,
holding several important posts, including ambassador to Great Britain. He and his wife,
Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, raised a family of nine children. John was the second born.</p>

<p>The family circle was close and warm, although the boys, four in all, were competitive,
a trait that would distinguish them all their lives. The slightly built John (or Jack, as
he was usually called) was often overshadowed by his older, sturdier brother, Joseph, Jr.,
who was likeable, outgoing, and aggressive. When Joseph, Jr., was born, his father was
reported to have remarked that he would be the first Kennedy to become president. </p>

<p>However, young Joe would be killed while piloting a bomber in World War II, leadership
of the new generation of Kennedy's passing to John, who would also serve in the war, but
survive it. The two younger brothers, Robert and Edward, would also have impressive
political careers, although Robert's life, like John's, was to end tragically.</p>

<p>As a boy, Kennedy attended private schools in Brookline and New York City and went on
to Choate School, a college preparatory school in Connecticut. Although his father was a
graduate of Harvard and his brother Joe was studying at Harvard, John decided to continue
his education at Princeton University. Joseph, Sr., kidded John about fleeing his older
brother's shadow, but John simply said that he wanted to be with his Choate friends, who
were going to Princeton. First, though, at his father's urging, he left for London in the
summer of 1935 to attend a session of the London School of Economics. Soon after arriving,
however, he came down with jaundice, a liver ailment, and had to return home. He entered
Princeton as planned the following fall, but a second attack of jaun dice forced him to
leave school. He spent months recuperating and the following year re-entered college, this
time choosing Harvard.</p>

<p><b>Young Manhood</b> </p>

<p>Harvard professors found John Kennedy &quot;a pleasant, bright, easygoing
student,&quot; although his grades were seldom higher than C in his first two years. He
worked on the college newspaper and went out for swimming, football, sailing, and other
sports. One day , he hurt his back in a junior varsity football game. It was the beginning
of a painful injury that would bother him for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Politics apparently did not concern him at first, but a visit to Europe in the summer
of 1937 increased his interest in world affairs. Another trip, this time to Eastern Europe
in 1939, sharpened his intellectual interests noticeably. His grades improved dramatically
in his senior year, and in 1940, he graduated from Harvard <i>cum laude</i> (&quot;with
honor&quot;). World War II had already begun in Europe. Kennedy's senior thesis reflected
his earlier observations so well that he turned it into a successful book, <i>Why England
Slept.</i> It was his explanation of the inaction of democratic nations in the face of the
early threats of war from Nazi Germany.</p>

<p><b>The War Years</b> </p>

<p>Out of college, Kennedy was uncertain about his future. He thought about attending Yale
Law School, went to business school at Stanford University for six months instead, then
toured South America. In 1941 he tried to enlist in the Army but was rejected because of
his old back injury. After five months of exercise to strengthen his back, he was accepted
for service by the Navy. </p>

<p>Kennedy found his assignments, mostly paperwork, dull. When the United States entered
World War II in December 1941, he applied for sea duty, underwent torpedo boat training,
and was commissioned an ensign. The next year he shipped out for the South Pacific. There
he became the central figure in one of the dramatic episodes of the war.</p>

<p><b>Exploits of PT-109</b> </p>

<p>In the early hours before dawn on August 2, 1943, Kennedy, now a lieutenant (junior
grade), was in command of the torpedo boat PT-109 on patrol near the Solomon Islands.
Suddenly a Japanese destroyer plowed through the darkness and cut Kennedy's boat in half.
Two of the twelve-man crew disappeared, one was badly burned, and others were less
seriously hurt. Kennedy himself was thrown to the deck and his back re-injured, but he
gathered his men on the bobbing bow, all that remained of his boat. When it seemed as if
the bow would sink, Kennedy ordered everyone to make for an island about 3 miles (5
kilometers) away. Those who could not swim were told to hang onto a plank, once part of
the gun mount, and push. Kennedy took charge of the burned crew m ember, and holding the
straps of the man's life vest with his teeth, he towed him to the island.</p>

<p>Kennedy swam to other islands to try to find help but got caught in an ocean current
and passed out, only his life vest saving him. Eventually, he and another officer found
two natives in a canoe. Scratching a message on a coconut, Kennedy handed it to the
natives, who carried it to a U.S. naval base. The men were rescued five days later. For
his courage and leadership, Kennedy won the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. </p>

<p>He refused a chance to leave active duty, but malaria and his old back injury finally
forced him into the hospital in 1944. After back surgery, he was discharged from the Navy
in 1945.</p>

<p><b>Journalism, Politics, and Marriage</b> </p>

<p>Still searching for a career, Kennedy went to work for the Hearst chain of newspapers.
He covered the San Francisco conference that established the United Nations, British
elections, and the Potsdam Conference held by the victorious Allied leaders at the end of
World War II. Deciding that journalism was not for him, however, Kennedy turned to
politics. </p>

<p>In 1946 he ran for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives from
a Boston district. By hard campaigning, he defeated a large field of rivals for the
nomination and easily won the election. After twice winning re-election, in 1952 he sought
and won election to the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>In 1953, Kennedy married Jacqueline Lee Bouvier in Newport, Rhode Island. They had
three children--Caroline, John, Jr., and Patrick, who lived only a few days.</p>

<p><b>His Congressional Record</b> </p>

<p>Kennedy's record in Congress--six years in the House of Representatives and eight in
the Senate--defied easy labeling. His strong liberal streak led him, for instance, to
oppose the loyalty oath that college students had to take to get a loan. His support of
labor's demands for higher-minimum-wage laws and other welfare benefits also stamped him
as a liberal. But when some liberals resisted union reform legislation, Kennedy disagreed.
He did not join the anti-union reformers, but took a moderate position. Only a master of
the art of politics could, in those days, insist on any union reforms at all and still
command the support of labor leaders, as Kennedy did.</p>

<p><b>The McCarthy Issue</b> </p>

<p>Kennedy displeased the liberals, however, by failing to take a strong position against
McCarthyism. He was in the hospital, suffering from a recurrence of his old back ailment,
when the Senate voted on December 2, 1954, to censure (reprimand) its Wisconsin Republican
member, Joseph R. McCarthy. McCarthy's methods of investigating Communist influence in the
United States during the early 1950's had caused great controversy. It was generally felt
that his methods had violated rules of fair play and had unjustly damaged reputations.
Liberals, in particular, criticized Kennedy for what they considered evasion of a
difficult issue. </p>

<p><b>Campaign for the Presidency</b> </p>

<p>Kennedy missed being nominated for vice president by a few votes at the National
Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1956. But he gained an introduction to the millions of
Americans who watched the convention on television, and when he decided to run for
president in 1960, his name was widely known. Many people thought that his religion and
his youthful appearance would handicap him. Kennedy faced the religion issue frankly,
declaring his firm belief in the separation of church and state. He drew some criticism
for his family's wealth, which enabled him to assemble a large staff and to get around the
country in a private plane. But he attracted many doubting Democratic politicians to his
side by winning delegate contests in every state primary he entered.</p>

<p>On gaining his party's nomination, Kennedy amazed nearly everybody by choosing Lyndon
B. Johnson, who had opposed him for the nomination, as his vice-presidential running mate.
Again, he used his considerable political skills to convince doubting friends that this
was the practical course.</p>

<p>Kennedy's four television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon, were
a highlight of the 1960 campaign. In the opinion of one television network president, they
were &quot;the most significant innovation in Presidential campaigns since popular
elections began.&quot; The debates were important in Kennedy's victory--303 electoral
votes to 219 for Nixon. The popular vote was breathtakingly close: Kennedy's winning
margin was a fraction of 1 percent of the total vote.</p>

<p><b>His Administration</b></p>

<p>Kennedy's major problems as president were the Cold War with the Soviet Union and its
Communist allies, the resistance of southerners in his own party to the demands of blacks
for full civil rights, and unemployment. Soon after taking office in 1961, he had to deal
with two dangerous confrontations with the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><b>Berlin</b> </p>

<p>As if to test the new president's courage, the Soviets chose to make Berlin, the
capital of pre-war Germany, a chief battleground of the Cold War. In the summer of 1961,
they intensified their pressures on West Berlin, which was under the protection of the
United States, Britain, and France and was entirely surrounded by Communist East German
territory. Kennedy insisted on the Western Allies' right of access to West Berlin, and
when the Communist authorities built a wall separating the city's eastern and western
sectors, he responded by increasing U.S. military forces. The Soviet threat subsided in
Berlin by 1962 but soon flared elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Cuban Crisis</b> </p>

<p>It struck closer to home, on the island of Cuba. Earlier, in April 1961, a group of
Cubans, trained by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), had launched an
unsuccessful invasion of the island in an attempt to overthrow the Communist regime of
Fidel Castro. Kennedy accepted responsibility for the affair, although its planning had
begun under the previous administration of President Dwight Eisenhower. The Cuban issue
became far more serious in the fall of 1962, when aerial photographs revealed the presence
of Soviet missiles and troops on the island. Kennedy insisted on their withdrawal,
proclaiming a naval blockade of the island. The crisis lasted for more than a week, en
ding when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to the U.S. demand.</p>

<p><b>Other Foreign Policy Measures</b> </p>

<p>Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union improved after the end of the
Cuban missile crisis, at least on the surface, but Cold War tensions continued. Increased
Communist guerrilla activity in South Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia led
Kennedy to greatly increase the number of U.S. military advisors there. To counter
Communist influence in Latin America, he established in 1961 the Alliance for Progress, a
program of aid and cooperation between the United States and the countries of the region.
A hopeful step was a treaty banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, signed in 1963,
after long and difficult negotiations, by the United States, the Soviet Union, and
Britain. </p>

<p><b>Civil Rights</b> </p>

<p>The civil rights issue presented the most difficult challenge to the president at home.
Demonstrations by blacks in the South for an end to segregation led Kennedy to declare a
&quot;moral crisis&quot; and call for legislation providing equal rights for all. When
rioting broke out at the University of Mississippi in 1962 over the enrollment of a black,
James Meredith, the administration sent federal marshals backed by national guardsmen to
the scene to restore order. This resulted in a white anti-Kennedy backlash in the South,
directed not only at the president but also at his brother Robert, who was attorney
general.</p>

<p><b>Other Domestic Issues</b> </p>

<p>Kennedy called his domestic program the New Frontier. Delaying tactics, more than
actual rejections, by Congress hampered his record of legislative achievements. His hopes
for new civil rights laws and a tax cut to help provide more jobs were unfulfilled at the
time of his death. However, Congress did pass the Trade Expansion Act, which enabled the
president to lower tariffs, or taxes on imports, to compete with nations of the European
Community (now the European Union). One of Kennedy's most popular achievements was the
Peace Corps, a volunteer organization that brought education and skills to developing
countries of the world.</p>

<p>Kennedy also appointed two new justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, Byron R. White and
Arthur J. Goldberg. Goldberg had served as his secretary of labor.</p>

<p><b>Life and Death</b> </p>

<p>During all this, pain from his old back injury returned. Kennedy wore a small brace and
suffered more than the public knew. Yet he loved life and politics. The image of vigor,
friendliness, and humor that he gave to the country was real. Even with the bur den of the
presidency, he found time to read both for information and for pleasure. He wrote two
books after he had entered politics, <i>Profiles in Courage</i> in 1956, which won the
Pulitzer Prize, and <i>Strategy of Peace</i> in 1960. He had a deep sense of history and
an appreciation of scholarship and was able to convey his thoughts in clear, forceful
language.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was in Dallas, Texas, on a political tour of the state.
Accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy and Texas governor John B. Connally, he was riding in an open
car in a motorcade when shots rang out, striking the president in the head and neck.
Kennedy was rushed to the hospital, but he died soon after without regaining
consciousness. Governor Connally was also wounded but he recovered. As the news was
relayed to a shocked nation,Vice President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president and
flown to Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Police arrested a man named Lee Harvey Oswald for the murder. Two days later, while
being transferred from one jail to another, Oswald himself was shot to death by Jack Ruby,
a Dallas nightclub owner.</p>

<p>A seven-member commission, headed by U. S. Chief Justice Earl Warren, was appointed by
President Johnson to investigate the assassination. It reported that Oswald, alone, had
fired the shots that killed the president, although questions surrounding Kennedy's death
have continued to arouse speculation ever since.</p>
