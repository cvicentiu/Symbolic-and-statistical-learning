            the son of <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAkennedyJP.htm">Joseph Patrick Kennedy</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfitzgeraldR.htm">Rose Fitzgerald,</a> was born in Brookline, 
            Massachusetts, on 29th May, 1917. His great grandfather, <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAkennedyP.htm">Patrick 
            Kennedy</a>, had emigrated from <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAEireland.htm">Ireland</a> 
            in 1849 and his grandfathers, <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAkennedyPJ.htm">Patrick Joseph 
            Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfitzgeraldJF.htm">John Francis Fitzgerald</a>, 
            were important political figures in <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAboston.htm">Boston</a>. 
            Kennedy's father was a highly successful businessman who later served 
            as ambassador to Great Britain (1937-40).<br>
            </font><font color="Black" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            In 1940 Kennedy graduated from <font color="Red"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAharvard.htm">Harvard 
            University</a></font> with a science degree. The same year saw the 
            publication of</font><font color="Teal" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            </font><font color="Red" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font color="#CC0000">Why 
            England Slept</font></i></font><font color="Black" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            (1940), a book on foreign policy. He joined the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAnavy.htm">United 
            States Navy</a> in 1941 and became an intelligence officer. After 
            the United States entered the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm">Second World War</a>, 
            Kennedy was transferred to the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron where he 
            was given command of a PT boat. <br>
            <br>
            Sent to the South Pacific, in August 1943, his boat was hit by a Japanese 
            destroyer. Two of his crew were killed but the other six men managed 
            to cling on to what remained of the boat. After a five hour struggle 
            Kennedy, and what was left of his crew, managed to get to an island 
            five miles from where the original incident took place. <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy suffered a bad back injury and in December 1943 was sent back 
            to the United States. When he recovered he was promoted to the rank 
            of lieutenant and became a PT instructor in Florida. After a further 
            operation on his back he returned to civilian life in March 1945. 
            For the next twelve months he worked as a journalist covering the 
            <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAun.htm">United Nations Conference</a> in San Francisco 
            and the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GE1945.htm">1945 General Election</a> in Britain.<br>
            <br>
            A member of the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAdemocratic.htm">Democratic Party</a>, 
            Kennedy won election to the House of Representatives in 1946. Over 
            the next couple of years he established himself as a loyal supporter 
            of <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAtruman.htm">Harry S. Truman</a>. In Congress he advocated 
            progressive taxation, the extension of social welfare and more low-cost 
            public housing. He was also a leading opponent of the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAhartley.htm">Taft-Hartley 
            Bill</a>. <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy took a strong interest in foreign policy and in 1951 toured 
            Europe visiting Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia and West 
            Germany. On his return he told the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations 
            that the United States should maintain its policy of helping to defend 
            Western Europe. However, he argued that the countries concerned should 
            contribute more to the costs of the operation. <br>
            <br>
            In the autumn of 1951 Kennedy visited the Middle East, India, Pakistan, 
            Indochina, Malaya and Korea. An opponent of colonial empires, Kennedy 
            urged that France should leave Algeria. He also argued for increased 
            financial aid to underdeveloped countries. <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1952. The following y<font color="#000000">ear

            few years four children were b</font><font color="Black" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">orn 
            but only two, Caroline and John, survived infancy. Kennedy continued 
            to suffer from back problems and had two operations in October 1954 
            and February 1955. While recovering in hospital he wrote the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jpulitzer.htm">Pulitzer 
            Prize</a> winning </font><font color="Red" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font color="#CC0000">Profiles 
            in Courage</font></i></font><font color="Black" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            (1956). <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy was a strong advocate of social welfare and civil rights legislation 
            in the Senate. Kennedy also sponsored bills for providing Federal 
            financial aid to education, liberalizing United States immigration 
            laws and a measure that required full disclosure of all employee pension 
            and welfare funds. <br>
            <br>
            In 1960 Kennedy entered the race to become the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAdemocratic.htm">Democratic 
            Party</a> presidential candidate. Kennedy won Democratic primaries 
            in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Maryland, Nebraska 
            and West Virginia. At the national convention in July 1960, Kennedy 
            was nominated on the first ballot. He selected <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAjohnsonLB.htm">Lyndon 
            B. Johnson</a>, as his running mate. <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy's candidacy was controversial because no <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/REcatholic.htm">Roman 
            Catholic</a> had ever been elected president. It was generally believed 
            that this had played an important factor in the defeat of <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAsmithA.htm">Al 
            Smith</a> in 1928. Kennedy decided to tackle this issue head on and 
            in a speech in Houston on 11th September, 1960, Kennedy attacked religious 
            bigotry and he explained how he believed in the absolute separation 
            of church and state. <br>
            <br>
            If elected, Kennedy, at 43, would be the second youngest president 
            in United States history (<a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArooseveltT.htm">Theodore Roosevelt</a> 
            was only 42 when he replaced the assassinated <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAmckinley.htm">William 
            McKinley</a> in 1901). In contrast, <font color="Red"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAnixon.htm">Richard 
            Nixon</a></font>, the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArepublican.htm">Republican Party</a> 
            candidate, had served for eight years as vice president under <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAeisenhower.htm">Dwight 
            Eisenhower</a>. During the campaign Nixon highlighted his opponent's 
            lack of experience but when the votes were counted, Kennedy won by 
            34,226,925 votes to 34,108,662. </font><font color="Black"><br>
            <br>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At his inaugural address 
            on 20th January, 1961, Kennedy challenged the people of the United 
            States with the statement: &quot;Ask not what your country can do 
            for you, but rather what you can do for your country.&quot; Kennedy 
            also wanted the young people of the country to help the undeveloped 
            world. He announced the establishment of the </font></font><font color="Maroon" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USApeacecorps.htm">Peace 
            Corps</a></font><font color="Black" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
            a scheme that intended to send 10,000 young people to serve in Africa, 
            Asia and Latin America. Kennedy argued that this &quot;practical, 
            inexpensive, person-to-person program will plant trust, good will 
            and a capacity for self-help&quot; in the underdeveloped world. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the first speech he 
            made to the American public as their President, Kennedy made it clear 
            that he intended to continue Eisenhower's policy of supporting the 
            South Vietnamese government of </font><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/VNngo.htm"><font size="3">Ngo 
            Dinh Diem</font></a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
            He argued that if South Vietnam became a communist state, the whole 
            of the non-communist world would be at risk. If South Vietnam fell, 
            Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Philippines, New Zealand and Australia would 
            follow. If communism was not halted in Vietnam it would gradually 
            spread throughout the world. This view became known as the </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDdomino.htm">Domino 
            Theory</a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Kennedy 
            went on to argue: &quot;No other challenge is more deserving of our 
            effort and energy... Our security may be lost piece by piece, country 
            by country.&quot; Under his leadership, America would be willing to: 
            &quot;pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any 
            friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy's speech had a 
            considerable impact on many young Americans. Philip Caputo was one 
            of those who traced back his decision to join the US Marines to Kennedy's 
            inauguration speech: &quot;War is always attractive to young men who 
            know nothing about it, but we had also been seduced into uniform by 
            Kennedy's challenge to &quot;ask what you can do for your country&quot; 
            and by the missionary idealism he had awakened in us... we believed 
            we were ordained to play cop to the Communists' robber and spread 
            our own political faith around the world.&quot;</font></p>

            planes began bombing Cuba's airfields. After the raids Cuba was left 
            with only eight planes<br>
            and seven pilots. Two days later five merchant ships carrying 1,400 
            Cuban exiles arrived at the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDbayofpigs.htm"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bay

            were sunk, including the ship that was carrying most of the supplies. 
            Two of the planes that were attempting to give air-cover were also 
            shot down. Within seventy-two hours all the invading troops had been 
            killed, wounded or had surrendered. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the beginning of September 
            1962, U-2 spy planes discovered that the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RussiaSU.htm">Soviet 
            Union</a> was building surface-to-air missile (SAM) launch sites. 
            There was also an increase in the number of Soviet ships arriving 
            in <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWcuba.htm">Cuba</a> which the United States government 
            feared were carrying new supplies of weapons. President Kennedy complained 
            to the Soviet Union about these developments and warned them that 
            the United States would not accept offensive weapons (SAMs were considered 
            to be defensive) in Cuba.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As the Cubans now had 
            SAM installations they were in a position to shoot down U-2 spy-planes. 
            Kennedy was in a difficult situation. Elections were to take place 
            for the United States Congress in two month's time. The public opinion 
            polls showed that his own ratings had fallen to their lowest point 
            since he became president.</font></p>

            polls suggested that after the elections he would have even less support

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">from power. One poll showed 
            that over 62 per cent of the population were unhappy with his policies 
            on Cuba. Understandably, the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArepublican.htm">Republicans</a> 
            attempted to make Cuba the main issue in the campaign.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This was probably in Kennedy's 
            mind when he decided to restrict the flights of the U-2 planes over 
            <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWcuba.htm">Cuba</a> . Pilots were also told to avoid flying 
            the whole length of the island. Kennedy hoped this would ensure that 
            a U-2 plane would not be shot down, and would prevent Cuba becoming 
            a major issue during the election campaign.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On September 27, a CIA 
            agent in Cuba overheard Castro's personal pilot tell another man in 
            a bar that Cuba now had nuclear weapons. U-2 spy-plane photographs 
            also showed that unusual activity was taking place at San Cristobal. 
            However, it was not until October 15 that photographs were taken that 
            revealed that the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RussiaSU.htm">Soviet Union</a> was placing 
            long range missiles in Cuba.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Kennedy's first 
            reaction to the information about the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">missiles 
            in Cuba was to call a meeting to discuss what should </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">be 
            done. Fourteen men attended the meeting and included </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">military 
            leaders, experts on Latin America, representatives of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the 
            CIA, cabinet ministers and personal friends whose advice </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy 
            valued. This group became known as the Executive </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Committee 
            of the National Security Council. Over the next few </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">days 
            they were to meet several times. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the first meeting of 
            the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, the CIA 
            and other military advisers explained the situation. After hearing 
            what they had to say, the general feeling of the meeting was for an 
            air-attack on the missile sites. Remembering the poor advice the CIA 
            had provided before the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDbayofpigs.htm"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bay 
            of Pigs</font></a> invasion, <font size="3" color="#000000">Kennedy 
            </font>decided to wait and instead called for another meeting to take 
            place that evening. By this time several of the men were having doubts 
            about the wisdom of a bombing raid, fearing that it would lead to 
            a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. The committee was now so divided 
            that a firm decision could not be made.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Executive Committee 
            of the National Security Council argued amongst themselves for the 
            next two days. The CIA and the military were still in favour of a 
            bombing raid and/or an invasion. However, the majority of the committee 
            gradually began to favour a naval blockade of Cuba.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Kennedy accepted their 
            decision and instructed Theodore Sorensen, a member of the committee, 
            to write a speech in which Kennedy would explain to the world why 
            it was necessary to impose a naval blockade of Cuba.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As well as imposing a naval 
            blockade, Kennedy also told the air-force to prepare for attacks on 
            Cuba and the Soviet Union. The army positioned 125,000 men in Florida 
            and was told to wait for orders to invade Cuba. If the Soviet ships 
            carrying weapons for Cuba did not turn back or refused to be searched, 
            a war was likely to begin. Kennedy also promised his military advisers 
            that if one of the U-2 spy planes were fired upon he would give orders 
            for an attack on the Cuban SAM missile sites.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world waited anxiously. 
            A public opinion poll in the United States revealed that three out 
            of five people expected fighting to break out between the two sides. 
            There were angry demonstrations outside the American Embassy in London 
            as people protested about the possibility of nuclear war. Demonstrations 
            also took place in other cities in Europe. However, in the United 
            States, polls suggested that the vast majority supported Kennedy's 
            action.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On October 24, President

            Soviet ships had stopped just before they reached the United States

            Khrushchev</font></a> sent an angry note to Kennedy accusing him of

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On October 26, Khrushchev 
            sent Kennedy another letter. In this he proposed that the Soviet Union 
            would be willing to<br>
            remove the missiles in Cuba in exchange for a promise by the United 
            States that they would not invade Cuba. The next day a second letter 
            from Khrushchev arrived demanding that the United States remove their 
            nuclear bases in Turkey.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While the president and 
            his advisers were analyzing Khrushchev's two letters, news came through 
            that a U-2 plane had been shot down over Cuba. The leaders of the 
            military, reminding Kennedy of the promise he had made, argued that 
            he should now give orders for the bombing of Cuba. Kennedy refused 
            and instead sent a letter to Khrushchev accepting the terms of his 
            first letter.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Khrushchev agreed and gave 
            orders for the missiles to be dismantled. Eight days later the elections 
            for Congress took place. The Democrats increased their majority and 
            it was estimated that Kennedy would now have an extra twelve supporters 
            in Congress for his policies.</font></p>

            made it clear that he intended to continue the policy of supporting 
            the South Vietnam's government. He argued that if South Vietnam became 
            a communist state, the whole of the non-communist world would be at 
            risk. He went on to claim that: &quot;No other challenge is more deserving 
            of our effort and energy. Our security may be lost piece by piece, 
            country by country.&quot; Kennedy added that under his leadership,

            <br>
            This strategy failed dismally and some observers claimed that it actually

            the majority of cases the peasants did not want to move and so the

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These details were used 
            to pressurise Kennedy into supplying more military advisers. This 
            he agreed to do and by the end of 1962 there were 12,000 in Vietnam. 
            Kennedy also made the decision to supply South Vietnam with 300 helicopters. 
            Their American pilots were told not to become &quot;engaged in combat&quot; 
            but this became an order that was difficult to obey. Although Kennedy

            legislation. However, in 1961 he sent 600 Federal marshals to Alabama 
            to protect the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfreedomR.htm">Freedom Riders</a>. They 
            were also used to protect the rights of African American students 
            at Mississippi University. <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy's civil rights bill was eventually brought before Congress 
            in 1963 and in a speech on television on 11th June, Kennedy pointed 
            out that: &quot;The Negro baby born in America today, regardless of 
            the section of the nation in which he is born, has about one-half 
            as much chance of completing high school as a white baby born in the 
            same place on the same day; one third as much chance of completing 
            college; one third as much chance of becoming a professional man; 
            twice as much chance of becoming unemployed; about one-seventh as 
            much chance of earning $10,000 a year; a life expectancy which is 
            seven years shorter; and the prospects of earning only half as much.&quot;

            who poured petrol over his head and then set fire to him. One eyewitness 
            later commented: &quot;As he burned he never moved a muscle, never 
            uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing 
            people around him.&quot; While Thich Quang Due was burning to death, 
            the monks and nuns gave out leaflets calling for Diem's government

            to this suicide was to arrest thousands of Buddhist monks. Many disappeared 
            and were never seen again. By August another five monks had committed 
            suicide by setting fire to themselves. One member of the South Vietnamese 
            government responded to these self-immolations by telling a newspaper 
            reporter: &quot;Let them burn, and we shall clap our hands.&quot; 
            Another offered to supply Buddhists who wanted to commit suicide with 
            the necessary petrol.</font></p>

            in Vietnam to protect him. In order to obtain a more popular leader 
            of South Vietnam, Kennedy agreed that the role of the CIA should change. 
            Lucien Conein, a CIA operative, provided a group of South Vietnamese

            of the crew of the American Motor Torpedo Boat that sank in the Blackett

            All morning they watched for the plane which they thought would be 
            looking for them. They cursed war in general and PTs in particular. 
            At about ten o'clock the hulk heaved a moist sigh and turned turtle. 
            McMahon and Johnston had to hang on as best they could. It was clear 
            that the remains of the 109 would soon sink. When the sun had passed 
            the meridian, Kennedy said, &quot;We will swim to that small island,&quot; 
            pointing to one of a group three miles to the southeast. &quot;We 
            have less chance of making it than some of these other islands here, 
            but there'll be less chance of Japs, too.&quot; Those<br>
            who could not swim well grouped themselves around a long two-by-six 
            timber with which carpenters had braced the 37-millimetre cannon on 
            deck and which had been knocked overboard by the force of the collision. 
            They tied several pairs of shoes to the timber, as well as the ship's 
            lantern, wrapped in a life jacket to keep it afloat. Thorn took charge 
            of this unwieldy group. Kennedy took McMahon in tow again. He cut 
            loose one end of a long strap on McMahon's Mae West and took the end 
            in his teeth. He swam breast stroke, pulling the helpless McMahon 
            along on his back. It took over five hours to reach the island. Water 
            lapped into Kennedy's mouth through his clenched teeth, and he swallowed 
            a lot. The salt water cut into McMahon's awful burns, but he did not 
            complain. Every few minutes, when Kennedy stopped to rest,<br>
            taking the strap out of his mouth and holding it in his hand, McMahon 
            would simply say, &quot;How far do we have to go?&quot;<br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy would reply, &quot;We're 
            going good.&quot; Then he would ask, &quot;How do you feel, Mac?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McMahon always answered, 
            &quot;I'm OK, Mr Kennedy. How about you?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of his burden, 
            Kennedy beat the other men to the reef that surrounded the island. 
            He left McMahon on the reef and told him to keep low, so as not to 
            be spotted by Japs. Kennedy went ahead and explored the island. It 
            was only a hundred yards in diameter; coconuts on the trees but none 
            on the ground, no visible Japs. Just as the others reached the island, 
            one of them spotted a Japanese barge chugging along close to shore. 
            They all lay low. The barge went on.</font></p>

            John F. Kennedy called the best brains he could assemble. He gathered 
            them from as far away as Moscow. Every embassador that served in Moscow 
            that was still alive was present. The brightest people that understood 
            the Soviet Union were present. They met every day for three weeks. 
            They became so cozy that President Kennedy began calling them his 
            crisis club. His crisis club. And they warned. They said, &quot;Mr. 
            President, don't back Khrushchev in to a corner. He is an impulsive 
            man. He is an impulsive man. You remember when he took a shoe off 
            at the United Nations and banged on a desk. He might very well push 
            a button that will send missiles toward the United States. Don't back 
            him in to a corner. Give him room to maneuver.&quot; That was their 
            advice. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John F. Kennedy did not 
            take it. He decided, he went before the crisis club after about three 
            weeks and he said, &quot;Gentlemen, I have decided on a boycott. We 
            are going to have to stop any more missiles from going in to Cuba, 
            and we are going to call upon the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles 
            that they have already planted there.&quot; One in the crisis club 
            said, &quot;Mr. President, what you are describing is an act of war. 
            Are you prepared to wage war with the Soviet Union?&quot; The president 
            said, &quot;We'll make it as easy as we can on the Soviets. We'll 
            offer to take our missiles back from Turkey and Greece. They are worn, 
            useless missiles that we were going to take back anyway, but on the 
            world's stage, it may give them, save them some loss of faith. So 
            we will offer to take back our missiles from Turkey and Greece, but 
            we will insist that they remove their missiles from Cuba, and if they 
            don't, we will have to stop them.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the members of this 
            group said, &quot;Mr. President, what if they don't stop? What if 
            the Soviets turn you down, and continue sending missiles to Cuba, 
            and you order them to stop, and what if they don't stop?&quot; The 
            president said, &quot;We will follow the procedures of the sea. We 
            will fire a warning shot across the bow, and if they don't stop then, 
            we will attack.&quot; One of the members said, &quot;Mr. President, 
            what if the situation were reversed? What if the Soviets tried to 
            stop our ships on the high seas and maybe even fired a warning shot. 
            What would you do?&quot; Jack Kennedy thought that over a bit. &quot;Well,&quot; 
            he said, &quot;it would depend on the circumstances, of course, but 
            most likely I would have to take military action.&quot; And this man 
            said, &quot;And what makes you think the Soviets won't do the same?&quot; 
            Now there were a lot of Monday morning statesman afterward that said 
            they knew that the Soviets would back down. I am here to report to 
            you, because I had sources in that meeting, in those meetings. They 
            told me exactly what was said. President Kennedy said, &quot;I don' 
            t know what the Soviets will do.&quot; </font></p>

            years, while slavery has vanished, progress for the Negro has been 
            too often blocked and delayed. Equality before the law has not always 
            meant equal treatment and opportunity. And the harmful, wasteful,

            Racial discrimination hampers our economic growth by preventing the 
            maximum development and utilization of our manpower. It hampers our 
            world leadership by contradicting at home the message we preach abroad. 
            It mars the atmosphere of a united and classless society in which 
            the nation rose to greatness. It increases the costs of public welfare, 
            crime, delinquency, and disorder. Above all, it is wrong. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

            tide of discontent that threatens the public safety.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nor is this a partisan

            But law alone cannot make men see right.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are confronted primarily 
            with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear 
            as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether 
            all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities; 
            whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be 
            treated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If an American, because

            if he cannot vote for the public officials who represent him; if, 
            in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, 
            then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who among us would then 
            be content with the counsels of patience and delay? One hundred years 
            of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet 
            their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet 
            freed from the bonds of injustice; they are not yet freed from social 
            and economic oppression.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this nation, for all

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The events in Birmingham 
            and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city 
            or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The fires of frustration 
            and discord are burning in every city, North and South. Where legal 
            remedies are not at hand, redress is sought in the streets in demonstrations, 
            parades and protests, which create tensions and threaten violence 
            - and threaten lives.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We face, therefore, a 
            moral crisis as a country and a people. It cannot be met by repressive 
            police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the 
            streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is a time 
            to act in the Congress, in your state and local legislative body, 
            and, above all, in all of our daily lives.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I am, therefore, asking 
            the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to 
            be served in facilities which are open to the public - hotels, restaurants 
            and theaters, retail stores and similar establishments. This seems 
            to me to be an elementary right.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm also asking Congress 
            to authorize the Federal Government to participate more fully in lawsuits 
            designed to end segregation in public education. We have succeeded 
            in persuading many districts to desegregate voluntarily. Dozens have 
            admitted Negroes without violence.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other features will also 
            be requested, including greater protection for the right to vote.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But legislation, I repeat, 
            cannot solve this problem alone. It must be solved in the homes of 
            every American in every community across our country.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this respect, I want 
            to pay tribute to those citizens, North and South, who've been working 
            in their communities to make life better for all.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> They are acting not out 
            of a sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency. Like 
            our soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world, they are meeting 
            freedom's challenge on the firing line, and I salute them for their

            that the glamor attached just to being in the White House, they become 
            almost irresistible. The particular charm of the Kennedys was that 
            they had a good deal of fun and often had their tongues in their cheeks

            maids and policemen, who might easily be Sargent Shriver. I'm not 
            being snobbish. It's just that rare quality which the Irish and no 
            other nation seem to have. I never had much time for old Joe Kennedy 
            but I've always thought Rose Kennedy is an extraordinary woman and 
            it was fun to see her delightful offspring enjoying themselves.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jack Kennedy was one of 
            the two Presidents of the United States whom it has been my privilege 
            to know well. I came to love and admire him in the sense that I did 
            Gaitskell. He was generous, very warm-hearted and a great humanitarian. 
            As I came to know him better, I got to feel less and less that he 
            was a doer. A thinker, a man of imagination, a man of inspiration, 
            a man of feeling - yes. But even though I be in a minority, here again 
            I think he was not what I regard as a great doer. I know that in writing 
            this I shall be reminded of Cuba, where Kennedy seemed to act with 
            the utmost decisiveness. Yet I have a nagging feeling that Cuba was 
            in a way a decision made for him. But he charmed Khrushchev as he 
            charmed me and as he charmed everybody else. All I can say here is 
            that there has been no politician, Gaitskell apart, in whose presence 
            I have felt more fascinated, charmed and excited about the possibilities 
            of power.</font></p>

            in June 1996. </font></b><br>
            <br>
            The domino theory... was the primary factor motivating the actions 
            of both the Kennedy and the Johnson administrations, without any qualification. 
            It was put forward by President Eisenhower in 1954, very succinctly: 
            If the West loses control of Vietnam, the security of the West will 
            be in danger. &quot;The dominoes will fall,&quot; in Eisenhower's 
            words. In a meeting between President Kennedy and President Eisenhower, 
            on January 19, 1961 - the day before President Kennedy's inauguration 
            - the only foreign policy issue fully discussed dealt with Southeast 
            Asia. And there's even today some question as to exactly what Eisenhower 
            said, but it's very clear that a minimum he said... that if necessary, 
            to prevent the loss of Laos, and by implication Vietnam, Eisenhower 
            would be prepared for the U.S. to act unilaterally - to intervene 
            militarily. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I think that this was 
            fully accepted by President Kennedy and by those of us associated 
            with him. And it was fully accepted by President Johnson when he succeeded 
            as President. The loss of Vietnam would trigger the loss of Southeast 
            Asia, and conceivably even the loss of India, and would strengthen 
            the Chinese and the Soviet position across the world, weakening the 
            security of Western Europe and weakening the security of North America. 
            This was the way we viewed it; I'm not arguing (we viewed it) correctly 
            - don't misunderstand me - but that is the way we viewed it. ... </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There were three groups 
            of individuals among his advisers. One group believed that the situation 
            (in South Vietnam) was moving so well that we could make a statement 
            that we'd begin withdrawals and complete them by the end of 1965. 
            Another group believed that the situation wasn't moving that well, 
            but that our mission was solely training and logistics; we'd been 
            there long enough to complete the training, if the South Vietnamese 
            were capable of absorbing it, and if we hadn't proven successful, 
            it's because we were incapable of accomplishing that mission and therefore 
            we were justified in beginning withdrawal. The third group believed 
            we hadn't reached the point where we were justified in withdrawing, 
            and we shouldn't withdraw. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy listened to the 
            debate, and finally sided with those who believed that either we had 
            succeeded, or were succeeding, and therefore could begin our withdrawal; 
            or alternatively we hadn't succeeded, but that ... we'd been there 
            long enough to test our ability to succeed, and if we weren't succeeding 
            we should begin the withdrawal because it was impossible to accomplish 
            that mission. In any event, he made the decision (to begin withdrawing 
            advisers) that day, and he did announce it. It was highly contested... 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy hadn't said before 
            he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would (completely) 
            withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would 
            have withdrawn rather than substitute US combat troops for Vietnamese 
            forces to save South Vietnam. I think he would have concluded that 
            US combat troops could not save Vietnam if Vietnam troops couldn't 
            save it. That was the statement he in effect made publicly before 
            his death, but at that time he hadn't had to choose between losing 
            Vietnam, on the one hand, or putting in US combat troops on the other. 
            Had he faced the decision, I think he would have accepted the loss 
            of Vietnam and refused to put in US combat troops</font>.</p>

            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During those hectic 
            months of late summer in 1963 when the Kennedy Administration appeared 
            to be frustrated and disenchanted with the ten-year regime of Ngo 
            Dinh Diem in Saigon, it approved the plans for the military coup d'&eacute;tat 
            that would overthrow President Diem and get rid of his brother Nhu. 
            The Kennedy Administration gave its support to a cabal of Vietnamese 
            generals who were determined to remove the Ngos from power. Having 
            gone so far as to withdraw its support of the Diem government and 
            to all but openly support the coup, the Administration became impatient 
            with delays and uncertainties from the generals in Saigon, and by 
            late September dispatched General Maxwell D. Taylor, then Chairman 
            of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and Secretary of Defense McNamara 
            to Saigon. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Upon their return, following 
            a brief trip, they submitted a report to President Kennedy, which 
            in proper chronology was the one immediately preceding the remarkable 
            one of December 21, 1963. This earlier report said, among other things 
            &quot;There is no solid evidence of the possibility of a successful 
            coup, although assassination of Diem and Nhu is always a possibility.&quot; 
            The latter part of this sentence contained the substantive information. 
            A coup d'&eacute;tat, or assassination is never certain from the point 
            of view of the planners; but whenever United States support of the 
            government in power is withdrawn and a possible coup d'&eacute;tat 
            or assassination is not adamantly opposed, it will happen. Only three 
            days after this report, on October 5, 1963, the White House cabled 
            Ambassador Lodge in Saigon: &quot;There should be... urgent covert 
            effort . . . to identify and build contact with possible alternate 
            leadership.&quot; Knowledge of a statement such as this one made by 
            the ostensible defenders and supporters of the Diem regime was all 
            those coup planners needed to know. In less than one month Diem was 
            dead, along with his brother.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thus, what was considered 
            to be a first prerequisite for a more favorable climate in Vietnam 
            was fulfilled. With the Ngo family out of the way, President Kennedy 
            felt that he had the option to bring the war to a close on his own 
            terms or to continue pressure with covert activities such as had been 
            under way for many years. Because the real authors were well aware 
            of his desires, there was another most important statement in the 
            McNamara-Taylor report of October 2, 1963: &quot;It should be possible 
            to withdraw the bulk of U.S. personnel by that time....&quot; (the 
            end of 1965).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

            a rather reckless personal life of apparent sexual excess - something

            continues to grow. I think this is for substantial, not insubstantial, 
            reasons.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is now apparent, with 
            the release of many classified documents, the writing of many memoirs, 
            and the release of many secret office recordings, that JFK was a real 
            skeptic about the use of military force in combat, and that although 
            he believed in a very strong military readiness posture for the United 
            States, and took his Cold War responsibilities extremely seriously, 
            he repeatedly used military force, or rather was prepared to use it, 
            only as a last resort, if all other options had been exhausted. For 
            example:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) He refused to bail 
            out the failed CIA Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba with U.S. troops, 
            as the JCS desired him to do;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) He ultimately refused 
            to either bomb or invade Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He 
            made all preparations to do so, and made sure the USSR saw these preparations, 
            and used this impending readiness as a powerful diplomatic tool to 
            leverage Kruschev, but his daily strategy during this crisis was to 
            continue to prepare for military action, while daily stalling the 
            hawks who demanded the use of military force. In doing so he probably 
            prevented a nuclear war, for we now know that the Russian rocket forces 
            in Cuba had permission to use tactical nuclear weapons (launched by 
            FROG missiles) against any US invasion forces, WITHOUT the advance 
            permission of Moscow. As Robert McNamara said in 1992, if thousands 
            of US sailors and Marines and Army troops had been &quot;fried&quot; 
            invading Cuba, it would have demanded a retaliatory response by JFK 
            and the nuclear war with the USSR would then have probably been unstoppable, 
            escalating day-by-day into a true Armageddon. Ted Sorenson, who knew 
            JFK's political instincts better than anyone else, has said that even 
            though the Cuban invasion was &quot;imminent&quot; at the time Kruschev 
            capitulated and agreed to remove the missiles, he was confident JFK 
            would have found ways and means to stall the hawks in the USG and 
            delay, or forestall, an invasion on a day-by-day basis, even though 
            it was theoretically approved for Tuesday (I think), 2 days after 
            Kruschev capitulated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) JFK clearly was intent 
            on withdrawing form Vietnam in 1965; he was disgusted with the entire 
            military and political situation in Vietnam, was angry that we had 
            become enmeshed and entrapped there with so many advisors, and was 
            determined to right this error after his re-election. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) JFK took the Cold War 
            seriously, but in the right way, and over the right issues. Berlin 
            was important (because it did involve serious issues of not appeasing 
            a superpower bully, whose appetite might then only be whetted for 
            more); Vietnam (which was increasingly apparent to be a local civil 
            war and not truly a vital superpower issue) was not. JFK wanted to 
            defeat communism, but NOT on the battlefield...he wanted to defeat 
            them in the Space Race, the ultimate superpower propaganda contest 
            in which national greatness and the validity of two competing systems 
            were going to be measured by technological prowess and economic strength, 
            not by a destructive war. JFK wanted to promote the positive values 
            of the West and the USA through volunteer service...through the Peace 
            Corps.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(5) JFK wanted above all 
            else to avoid an accidental, unintentional World War in the Nuclear 
            Age. His own WW II experiences (in which he learned to be very skeptical 
            about military leadership and so-called expertise), his study of Barbara 
            Tuchman's book &quot;The Guns of August&quot; about WW I, and the 
            fresh memory of the Korea stalemate in Asia all made him very cautious 
            about the use of military force. He wanted to go to war only if we 
            HAD TO...not because the hawks in the USG wanted to. And if we &quot;had 
            to&quot; go to war, he wanted to ensure it was over a vital interest 
            like Soviet aggression in Europe, not over a sideshow in Southeast 
            Asia where US interest were not directly threatened.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(6) This man chose a life 
            of public service, when he could, instead, have rolled up in a ball 
            of self-pity and lived a selfish life of luxury all alone, feeling 
            sorry for himself because of his serious illness (addison's disease) 
            and his back pain (which was constant and unremitting). Yet all those 
            who knew him well said he never uttered a word of self-pity, and had 
            a genuine optimism about the future of man, about the positive role 
            [and great responsibility] of the United States in the 20th century, 
            and genuinely believed in the credo of public service that he so openly 
            promoted.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(7) JFK became very courageous 
            on civil rights in 1963, after a couple of years of dithering in 1961 
            and 1962. He could not duck the issue any longer, and strongly and 
            firmly came down in favor of equal opportunity in education and proposed 
            a very bold civil rights bill which LBJ got passed in his memory as 
            part of the JFK legacy after his assassination.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(8) JFK's Peace Speech 
            at the American University in June 1963 was a truly remarkable document, 
            just as the Test Ban Treaty in September of 1963 was a noteworthy 
            accomplishment. The Test Ban Treaty was his proudest achievement, 
            and the Peace Speech (which rejected a military PAX AMERICANA and 
            asked Americans to re-evaluate their altitudes about the Soviet Union) 
            challenged both Americans and the Soviets to end the Cold War...a 
            full generation before it finally happened.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion, regardless 
            of whether people have advanced degrees or not, or think about politics 
            frequently or infrequently, they have a pretty good sense of these 
            things today in America; following the disaster of LBJ's War in Vietnam, 
            and the current disillusionment over America's Iraq adventure, JFK's 
            sober caution in foreign affairs looks pretty good to most Americans. 
            (His one big screw-up was the Bay of Pigs; he openly acknowledged 
            this, and he learned valuable lessons from it about being cautious 
            about the so-called expertise of others, and about the limits of military 
            power.) So does his intelligent, well-informed and reasoned (but not 
            jingoistic) patriotism, his encouragement of public service, his insatiable 
            curiosity, his support of the arts in America, and his optimism. So 
            does his correct and courageous (if a bit belated) stand on civil 
            rights in America. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">America was on the right 
            road in 1963 when he died. After his death, with the exception of 
            the Apollo Moon Landing program and other space initiatives which 
            he began, everything else went downhill fast in the 1960s. Americans 
            know, and appreciate these facts. It is the mainstream historians 
            who get it wrong when they say JFK was not a great President; the 
            man in the street knows better. If he had lived to serve a full 8 
            years, I think the mainstream historians would treat him more kindly 
            because they would have more concrete, completed accomplishments to 
            write about. (Mainstream historians recognize concrete accomplishments 
            rather than potential, and possibilities, and could-have-beens.) JFK 
            was great because he had the country going in the right direction, 
            avoided a nuclear war (and appeasement) through his caution and firm 
            resolve during the missile crisis, promoted public service and the 
            arts, and was responsible for the robust space program which may be 
            the principal accomplishment for which the the post-WW II USA is remembered 
            500 years from now (as JFK himself predicted). </font></p>

            Guardian</a> (23rd November, 1963) </font></b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President John Fitzgerald 
            Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was shot during 
            a motorcade drive through downtown Dallas this afternoon. He died 
            in the emergency room of the Parkland Memorial Hospital 32 minutes 
            after the attack. He was 46 years old. He is the third President to 
            be assassinated in office since Abraham Lincoln and the first since 
            President McKinley in 1901.</font> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the late afternoon the 
            Dallas police took into custody a former Marine, one Lee H. Oswald, 
            aged 24, who is alleged to have shot a policeman outside a theatre. 
            He is said to have remarked only, &quot;It is all over now.&quot; 
            He is the chairman of a group called the &quot;Fair Play for Cuba 
            Committee,&quot; and is married to a Russian girl. He is described 
            at the moment as &quot;a prime suspect.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new President is the 
            Vice-President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, a 55-year-old native Texan, 
            who took the oath of office in Dallas at five minutes to four at the 
            hands of a woman judge and later arrived in Washington with the body 
            of the dead President.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is being written in 
            the numbed interval between the first shock and the harried attempt 
            to reconstruct a sequence of fact from an hour of tumult. However, 
            this is the first assassination of a world figure that took place 
            in the age of television, and every network and station in the country 
            took up the plotting of the appalling story. It begins to form a grisly 
            pattern, contradicted by a grisly preface: the projection on television 
            screens of a happy crowd and a grinning President only a few seconds 
            before the gunshots. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President was almost 
            at the end of his two-day tour of Texas. He was to make a lunch speech 
            in the Dallas Trade Mart building and his motor procession had about 
            another mile to go. He had had the warmest welcome of his trip from 
            a great crowd at the airport. The cries and pleas for a personal touch 
            were so engaging that Mrs Kennedy took the lead and walked from the 
            ramp of the presidential plane to a fence that held the crowd in. 
            She was followed quickly by the President, and they both seized hands 
            and forearms and smiled gladly at the people. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Secret Service and 
            the police were relieved to get them into their car, where Mrs Kennedy 
            sat between the President and John B. Connally, the Governor of Texas. 
            The Dallas police had instituted the most stringent security precautions 
            in the city's history: they wanted no repetition of the small but 
            disgraceful brawl that humiliated Adlai Stevenson in their city when 
            he attended a United Nations rally on October 24. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The motorcade was going 
            along slowly but smoothly three muffled shots, which the crowd first 
            mistook for fireworks, cracked through the cheers. One hit the shoulder 
            blade and the wrist of Governor Connally who was taken with the President 
            to the hospital, where his condition is serious. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other brought blood 
            trickling from the back of the sitting President's head. His right 
            arm flopped from a high wave of greeting and he collapsed into the 
            arms of Mrs Kennedy, who fell unharmed. She was heard to cry &quot;Oh, 
            No&quot; and sat there all the way cradling his head in her lap. As 
            some people bayed and screamed and others fell to the ground, and 
            hid their faces, the secret service escort broke into two groups, 
            one speeding the President's car to the hospital: and another joined 
            a part of the heavy police escort in wheeling off in pursuit of a 
            man fleeing across some railroad tracks. Nothing came of this lead.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President was taken 
            to the emergency room of the Parkland Hospital and Governor Connally 
            was taken into the surgery. Mrs Kennedy went in with the living President 
            and less than an hour later came out with the dead man in a bronze 
            coffin, which arrived shortly after two priests had administered the 
            last rites of the Roman Catholic Church. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The body was escorted by 
            Generals Clifton and McHugh, the President's chief military and air 
            force aides, to the Dallas Airport and flown thence to Washington. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within an hour of the President's 
            death, the Secret Service had found a sniper's nest inside the building 
            from which the first witnesses swore the bullets had been fired. It 
            is a warehouse for a school text book firm, known as the Texas School 
            Depository, on the corner of Elm and Houston Streets. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an upper room, whose 
            open window commanded the route of the Presidential motorcade, the 
            Servicemen found the remains of a fried chicken and a foreign-made 
            rifle with a telescopic sight. Alongside it lay three empty cartridges.</font></p>
