    John F. Kennedy remains one of the most fascinating and controversial
    politicians of the 20th century. This bestselling first volume
    of Nigel Hamilton's biography caused unprecedented controversy
    by its frankness and its overturning of myths. But whether or
    not the family and the political establishment like it, it is
    the nearest we will ever get to the JFK story from JFK's own
    point of view. <I>Reckless Youth</I> is based on a wealth of
    hitherto unpublished material from JFK's closest surviving friends,
    from FBI, Navy college and National Archives records, as well
    as new material in JFK's own words.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As World War 2 was ending and the cold war
    just beginning, a 28-year-old naval hero, decommissioned early
    due to crippling injuries, traveled through a devastated Europe.
    During the trip, he kept a journal that shows that this trip
    was a turning point in the future president's life. The scion
    of one of the United States' wealthiest families, John F. Kennedy
    grew up in the shadow of an older brother from whom great things
    were expected. When Joe Kennedy, Jr. was killed in the skies
    over the English Channel, the expectations and mantle of leadership
    passed to JFK. As he traveled in the company of cabinet secretaries,
    generals, future presidents, and prime ministers, and as he toured
    a humbled Germany and saw the practice of power by Soviet Communists,
    he questioned accepting it. It was in these pages that he first
    confronted the &quot;long twilight struggle&quot; for the preservation
    of Western freedom that would define his own future presidency
    in the United States. It was at this time that Kennedy began
    laying plans for his first run for Congress. <I>Prelude to Leadership</I>
    offers insight into the mind of a young man preparing himself
    for a &quot;still distant challenge.&quot;</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Nearly everyone who was alive and aware in
    1963 can remember where they were when they heard of the assassination
    of President John F. Kennedy. No single event stood out so sharply
    in people's memories or shocked so many so deeply. But Kennedy's
    tragic death has colored our view of his life, creating a national
    blind spot that has hindered a fair assessment of his administration.
    In <I>The Presidency of John F. Kennedy</I>, historian James
    Giglio provides a succinct, comprehensive, and highly readable
    assessment of the Kennedy years.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As a man, Giglio contends, Kennedy was indeed
    charming, witty, intelligent, and handsome, but he was also ambitious
    and vulnerable - a man who often failed to measure up to his
    romantic image. As president, Kennedy did deal effectively with
    many domestic economic and social issues, but he provided only
    sporadic and belated leadership in civil rights. And according
    to Giglio, Kennedy made little effort to combat poverty. He was
    more adept at managing foreign crises than preventing them, and
    by 1963, Giglio writes, Kennedy was on a collision course in
    Vietnam.</FONT></P>

    <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;Covering every important domestic
    and foreign topic, this treatment is at once balanced, comprehensive,
    authoritative, and readable. . . . With this book, Kennedy studies
    at last move beyond both apology and revisionism to dispassionate
    analysis and mature reflection.&quot; - Allen J. Matusow<BR>

    President Kennedy is the compelling, dramatic history of JFK's
    thousand days in office. It illuminates the presidential center
    of power by providing an indepth look at the day-by-day decisions
    and dilemmas of the thirty-fifth president as he faced everything
    from the threat of nuclear war abroad to racial unrest at home.</FONT></P>

    <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">Reeves ... offers an excellent
    study of Kennedy as crisis manager. He presents Kennedy as neither
    an amoral playboy nor the ruler of Camelot but a poorly prepared
    president with mediocre congressional experience. Each chapter
    presents a different day in the administration - a unique format
    that effectively reveals how Kennedy responded to simultaneous
    harrowing issues. The Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crises,
    Vietnam, and the diplomacy of arms reduction illustrate how Kennedy
    was constrained by the unshakable Cold War fear of monolithic
    communism ... a thorough, even-handed review of the Kennedy years.

    </B><BR>
    In October of 1962, U.S. jets took off from Florida and headed
    south on airborne alert. Should Cuba react militarily, they were
    prepared to respond with force. After John Kennedy's fateful
    17-minute address, the United States was about to become involved
    in the most dangerous event the world had ever experienced. From
    October 15 - 28, the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war.
    <I>Thirteen Days / Ninety Miles</I> recreates the events of the
    time and examines the major personalities, especially Kennedy
    and USSR premier Nikita Khrushchev. Using recently declassified
    information, Finkelstein traces the missile crisis from its origins
    down to a breathtaking finale.</FONT></P>

    presidency, rising tensions with the USSR and Cuba, and Soviet
    denials of their placement of offensive weapons in Cuba. He then
    provides detailed information on exactly how Kennedy and his
    advisors managed their end of the crisis and some Soviet politics

    </FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1">by <B>Richard Mahoney</B></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This intriguing book brings a fresh perspective
    to bear on the intimate, charged partnership of John and Robert
    Kennedy. The author, Richard D. Mahoney, whose father was a friend
    of Bobby's and an appointee of Jack's, has both the academic
    and political experience necessary to evaluate evidence of the
    Kennedys' relations with the Mafia, anti-Castro rebels, and other
    groups lurking in the shadows of American life. He also has a
    sharp eye for the brothers' differing yet complementary personalities.
    Jack was intellectual and cheerfully cynical, with a zest for
    pleasure increased by a life-threatening illness concealed from
    the public. He looked to passionate, partisan Bobby for bulldog-like
    political support and used his brother as a &quot;moral compass&quot;
    when planning his administration's actions on civil rights, the
    corruption of organized labor, and the containment of Communism.
    Their powerful father, Joseph - whose deep pockets basically
    bought Jack the presidency and at the same time compromised it
    because of Joseph's links to organized crime - looms over the
    brothers as the author of a Faustian bargain that may well have
    played a role in JFK's assassination. Mahoney's vivid, compulsively
    readable text offers suggestive questions rather than definitive
    answers, but it certainly succeeds as a bracing corrective to
    &quot;America's inability to see its history as tragedy,&quot;
    a failure Jack and Bobby emphatically did not share. - <I>Wendy

    a secret plan for neutralization and withdrawal - if he won the
    1964 election. But that, of course, was not to be: Convinced
    he would die young, Kennedy foresaw that a violent death would
    claim him. Throughout his brief time in the White House he was
    haunted by a vision of a man standing at a window, looking down
    at him, holding a rifle.</FONT></P>
