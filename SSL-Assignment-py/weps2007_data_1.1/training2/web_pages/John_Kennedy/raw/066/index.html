<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">If my church attempted to influence me in a way which was improper or which affected adversely my responsibilities as a public servant sworn to uphold the Constitution, then I would reply to them that this was an improper action on their part.

-- <b>John F Kennedy</b>, press conference, Houston, Texas, September 12, 1960, from Albert J Menendez and Edd Doerr, <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">We do not want an official state church. If ninety-nine percent of the population were Catholics, I would still be opposed to it. I do not want civil power combined with religious power. I want to make it clear that I am committed as a matter of deep personal conviction to separation.<br><font size="-1" color=#330000>

Kennedy">It is my firm belief that there should be separation of church and state as we understand it in the United States -- that is, that both church and state should be free to operate, without interference from each other in their respective areas of jurisdiction. We live in a liberal, democratic society which embraces wide varieties of belief and disbelief. There is no doubt in my mind that the pluralism which has developed under our Constitution, providing as it does a framework within which diverse opinions can exist side by side and by their interaction enrich the whole, is the most ideal system yet devised by man. I cannot conceive of a set of circumstances which would lead me to a different conclusion.<br><font size="-1" color=#330000>
-- <b>John F Kennedy</b>, letter to Glenn L Archer, February 23, 1959, from Albert J Menendez and Edd Doerr, <i>The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom</i></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Voters are more than Catholics, Protestants or Jews. They make up their minds for many diverse reasons, good and bad. To submit the candidates to a religious test is unfair enough -- to apply it to the voters is divisive, degrading and wholly unwarranted.<br><font size="-1" color=#330000>

I believe the founding fathers meant it when they provided in Article VI of the Constitution that there should be no religious test for public office. And I believe that the American people mean to adhere to those principles today.<br><font size="-1" color=#330000>

<font size="-1">-- <b>John F Kennedy</b>, address to the Ministerial Association of Greater Houston, September 12, 1960</font></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#330000>[Passage]:<br><font size="+1" color="#660000">I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute -- where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote -- where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference -- and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish -- where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches, or any other ecclesiastical source -- where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials -- and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.<br></font>

For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.<br><font size="-1" color=#330000>-- <b>John F Kennedy</b>, on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America (February 26, 1962), quoted from Floyd College, Rome, Georgia, &quot;<a href="http://www.fc.peachnet.edu/library/banned/index.htm" target="_top">Banned Books -- Quotes</a>&quot;</font></font></p><p align=center><img src="aaa.300.gif" alt="Short Graphic Rule" vspace=18 height=1 width=40%></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#330000><b>Menendez: Kennedy Revitalized Pluralism</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color=#330000>&quot;<font color="#990000">The significance of the Kennedy Presidency as far as cultural pluralism is concerned is that it reaffirmed and revitalized the pluralist impulse and led to major accommodations between religious groups. JFK was a free man. By being free, he freed many Catholics and Protestants from the debilitating recriminations of the past.</font>&quot;<br><font size="-1">
