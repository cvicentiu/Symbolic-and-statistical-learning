<pre>*** Soon2BCop (~John@mkc-65-28-12-131.kc.rr.com) has joined channel #sf
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Hello
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> anyone in here?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> there's no php.ini file in /usr/local/lib, but
<font color="red">&lt;z:#sfkids&gt;</font> soontobecop is back
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> sometimes in /usr/local/etc or other places..
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> there is a 'php' directory with a whole bunch of other stuff
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> still no php.ini in there, though
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> digging further
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> u need to find php.ini which is often in it's own separate place..
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there doesnt have to be a php.ini file, it uses defaults if you dont
 have one I think
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but when you install php I think it geives you a sample fiel you can
 modify
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Can anyone see what Im typing?
*** You are now talking to channel #sfkids
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop:#sf&gt;</font> Does anyone know anything about that post and picture of
 Officer Sweeney from Richmond?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-:#sfkids&gt;</font> who is soon to be cop?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-:#sfkids&gt;</font> does he come here often?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> hes a soon to be Richmond PD officer
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar:#sf&gt;</font> did a find from / on php.ini, no go
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> gek wanted to talk to him if he came back online
*** You are now talking to channel #sf
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> it's a commercial host, they may have it locked up somewhere
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> if there's no php.ini then i guess you need to create it...  
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i roasted my own server in an attempt to set up slashcode on it...
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> look for php*.ini it defaults to php-local or something like that in
 the example file
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Hello?
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> it has been said that Hello is anyone there
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> checking
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> nada
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Can anyone see this
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Do you guys know who originally posted that article on Officer
 Sweeney
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> ?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> Soon2BCop, just a sec we are  trying to help somone fix a tech thing
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> ok
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> where did you install php
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> well, i guess i could just try wrestling with my server here some
 more
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> it's not my box, it's in Michigan or something, sadly
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i had a development box set up,
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> do you know it has php installed on it?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> oh, yeah, it's there
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i guess i could do a phpinfo() call?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> would that tell me where it was?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> try it
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you can also type php -i on teh command line I think
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> heh.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> says it's in /usr/local/lib
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> :)
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i'll look again, but i don't think it's there
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but nothing in there?
<font color="red">&lt;z:#sfkids&gt;</font> so anyone want to talk to soon2bcop, wes waiting

<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> hmm, ok let me look on my machine and see if I can find anything that
 helps
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> my server here is kind of cooked, i'm halfway through a debian
 install and it doesn't like my video card
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> otherwise this
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why is Officer Sweeney's photo posted on here
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> would be easier
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and who do I need to talk to, to get it removed
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, I kinda need to help fix this, but long story short. Indymedia
 is like a newsgroup so we dont really take anything down
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> you just need to add to php.ini include_path = ".
 :/whatever/sf-active/sf-active"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Even if it is a photo posted without permission? includeing
 slanderous and untrue remarks?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i'll keep digging through those directories...
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> :)
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> perhaps you could simply create a 1-line php.ini and restart apache?  
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> normally though php.ini is a lengthy file.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> would a commercial host let me do that?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> seems unlikely, somehow...
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> do they have a sysadmin? you could ask him about the php.ini file
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> can you maybe take a look at what's happening so we're sure this
 is the problem?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> if a commercial host has php, then i'd hope they would allow you to put
 in an include path,
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> the problem is, like, that when you start thinking of that stuff, you
 tend to think of things blowing up, because that's what happens if you fuck
 up with that stuff (not good at all...)
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> http://sf-active/sf-active/redstone/website/
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> yeah you need that include path!
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> ok, i'll check out the sysadmin dudes
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> tehy may have it in some special location so multiple things can run
 on teh machine and tehy would tehn want nobody to modify teh ini file since
 it applys to everyone
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i talked to espe in here a week or two ago, he said that the tech
 collective in sf was willing to offer us server space, would this still be a
 go?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> the only way to get it working without changing php.ini is to change
 every single php file in sf-active to be able to find global.cfg
*** abag (abag@.uy) has joined channel #sfkids
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, I only do tech stuff so I couldnt take your thing down if I
 wanted to, but my impression about permission laws would be that this would
 not apply to anyone in public
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yes it was in public, but the statements made surrounding the
 photos are untrue
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and possibly slanderous
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, its an open post news site, anyone can post, crazy people post,
 just about anyone posts, that would be like cliaming a usenet group was
 slanderous
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, or a CNN mesage board
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> except cnn message boards do censor...
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> S2bc are u the sweeney fan club or what?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> no smart alec
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But I do know him
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And I know that what those idiots are saying is not the story
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> whats the story?
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> hmmm... the story is unfolding on imc-editorial. :)
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> What is the url in question here?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> emailed the sysadmins for the server
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> dunbar, cool, they probably know what you should modify if they
 isntalled php and apache
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its on the messageboard or whateve
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> do u have the url so i can take a look?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if you copy the url into thsi window we kind look to see which
 artcile you are refering to
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, how did you find out about this site? Do you look at it often?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> thanks for your help, mx- and z
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> dunbar, no problem
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I actually was talking to him a week or so ago and he told me of
 the incident 
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> good luck dunbar!  stay warm...
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> now i'm kind of interested in this drama unfolding before me...
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And I searched for it just under yahoo.com
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> ANd that came up
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and then I just saw this chat button to the left
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> what did you search for, his name?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> it would be amazing if we came up near teh top in google for a search
 on Sweeney
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I did a couple searches
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> One was Richmond, one was his name
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yeah its real amazing. These jackasses want to file a suit against
 him
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> s2bc i found your comment on sf.indymedia.. i have to say, i was there
 and have it all on video if you don't believe the photo and article... 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> mx-, was that teh officer who maced himself in teh face?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I find that VERY hard tobelieve
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> What was your post?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Yes, that's him!
*** Signoff: abag ()
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> s2bc you're right i only have bits and pieces on video, not "all" per se,
 but there were many other video cameras there.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> What is your story of the event mx-
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yeah and its convenient how that "record" button doesn't get hit
 until after police have been instigated or assaulted
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> ok, S2BC I dont know much about teh rest of the incident but that
 doesnt seem like gerat behavior, dont they train you how to aim a pepper
 spray thing, spraying yourself in the face just seems unprofessional
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> is your friend trained on how to deal with riots and protests?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I took some college classes with him, I did not attend the same
 academy
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But Im quite sure he is properly trained
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> All i can say is, i didnt see everything but officer #149, sweeney if you
 will, was off the hook.  most officers there weren't running around hitting
 random people.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And all I can say is Im sure there is more to the story
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well post it as a comment
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I did
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you said you throught he ws a good cop, ok thats great but its not
 going to convince people
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> neither is some fabricated story from some anti-cop wacko
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well then post a comment on what you think really happened
*** Signoff: dunbar (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> from what I saw frm teh video of the event he looked angry and he was
 a little out of control (spraying yourself because you forget which way to
 turn a pepper spray container is a clear sign of that)
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but if you know of other details make tehm known by posting them as a
 comment
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if he really wasnt trained for that kind of situation then make that
 known, maybe peopel will sue his commanding officer then
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Mistakes happen
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> The story here is the WTO, chevron and police represssion.  It's not
 wacko. it's reality.  s2bc your rhetoric certainly offers another point of
 view but doesn't contradict the basic facts here.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You have to make split second decisions in this line of work
*** dunbar (dunbar@.net) has joined channel
 #sf
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, but dealing with a protest should be something you get trained
 for since its pretty obvious waht will happen, its not like you are acting in
 a split second to deal with people who have guns on them
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> rhetoric? As if that is not what you are spewing and crap Ive
 already heard hundreds of times
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> S2BC, independent observer from Canada here, just a thought:
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> do you believe in the court system?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> All i'm saying is I was there with my video camera and saw officer #149
 acting a bit out of control, if you've heard that hundreds of times then
 perhaps the complainants wouldn like to speak to you.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> because if you do, and your friend is innocent and there were 10
 video cameras around, he's going to be just fine.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> not that i know anything about this
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> dunbar, well said.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, your angry because your friend is getting sued for what he was
 doing on the job. Teh people suing him are angry since he was attacking them
 for issues they cared about. if you want to make people change their opinions
 write a ocmment with that in mind. If you think being a cop is hard and you
 get a lot of flack from rich kids with lawyers write something, but just
 saying I think hes innocent without facts isnt going to change any
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I was reading other posts about the incident
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I assume you dont trust teh court system. But ask yourself why you
 dont trust it. People who have money for good lawyers get what tehy want and
 everyone else suffers. Thats how alot of things are in the country and thats
 why people were protesting. You may not agree with what tehy were doing or
 think it was ineffective, but I'm sure you agree with teh basic problem.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> The world revolves around money
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not disputing that
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> However throwing rocks, and juvenile verbal insults are not the
 way to solve anything
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> and your firend probably has no chance in court against a high priced
 lawyer
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who says they have a good lawyer?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but the police dept will probably settle out of court and your friend
 will lose whether or not he was guilty
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He will have a good chance because their story is b.s.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Where is the video of the incident? Is it online?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> It might be, I dont know
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And these little shits wonder why sometimes we have short tempers
 or arent always in a great mood.
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> who was throwing rocks?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> The funny thing is the second someone breaks into their home, or
 smashes into the side of their car, rapes their girlfriend, etc. who do they
 call
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont know who it was
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> yes you lose your temper, but so do teh protesters but when they do
 they go to jail
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> i didnt see any rock thrrowing.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well we are out there for a reason, to keep the peace
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> The protestors are out there to play some martyr
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and cause trouble
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I bet half of them didnt even know the cause
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> yeah whatever, what harm could tehy have caused, it looked like it
 was under a freeway made of cement
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and if they did, what was the little gathering going to
 accomplish?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> nothing.
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> nothing is funny
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Um, actually the protesters are struggling for their community.  against
 exploitation, pollution, that sort of thing.  there were some really amazing
 heartfelt speeches given in front of chevron that day.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well what could people do to change things?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its not the protest itself that gets them in trouble
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> .
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its their attitude and behavior when we show up
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well, your the authority so people dont like that, I'd think youd
 expect that. Its human nature
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And we do. I am not naive. I know that I am not going to always be
 mr. popular because some people are just ignorant
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I, like everyone else when through the anti authroity, rebellious
 phase
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> but like most others I grew up....
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> People were randomly arrested for sitting in or walking around, nothing
 in particular.  I don't know if you were there, but I there were two kinds of
 bad attitudes present that day: a large crowd of poeple protesting Chevron,
 and a smaller crowd of police surrounding them, staring grimly.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> people are protesting Chevron and you are defending it so to them
 your not just doing a job to scrape by, you represnt what tehy are fighting
 against. It doenst make sense but you should expect that. Like in New York
 where firefighters attacked teh cops since they were angry about not being
 able to get more people into ground zero.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> At the same time, it seems people are getting more and more brave
 thinking they can get away with videotaping us, getting in our face, etc
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But that is pure stupidity z. We are there to make sure peace
 is kept.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> what's wrong with being videotaped if you're not doing anything
 wrong?  i mean, that's the argument which gets used all the time by the
 police, yes?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Because there are 2 sides to every story.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and it is not our position to take a side when on-duty
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> I'd like to know just why the police provoked the confrontation - I think
 it is to discourage people from protesting in a similar way against similar
 targets in the future.  I saw police prevent people from video taping and
 photographing, in fact arresting some of those people.  How could it be
 illegal to be a witness?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Police did not provoke
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> thats the first lie
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> things escalate, but you should be trained to not escalate them if
 you are used to a protest or riot situation
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and concerning the videotaping thing, people who are doing that
 are trying to get something on police. Therefore, they can take that little
 videotape and edit stuff and take stuff out of context
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Well I was there and I can assure you that this was a large crowd of
 local residents voicing their grievances against Chevron and the WTO by
 giving speeches, eating, and so forth.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you guys have videos running in your cars dont you so you should have
 a video of the incident too?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well if some scumbag has no respect for the men in blue who are
 risking their lives to protect even the ungrateful garbage and make the
 community safer, they get what they deserve
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Can we quote you on that?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but from what I can see on teh video you were not protecting anything
 except an empty track of freeway
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Those cameras are not usually on 24/7. At least here. We have to
 turn them on
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> what about the employees of Chevron?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who's to say your way is the righteous way? 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Again, 2 sides to every story
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> it was outside teh factory wasnt it
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> s2bc are you out of your mind?  These people were not in any way
 attempting to trespass on the hallowed, polluted grounds of the chevron
 fortress.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> well they have employees coming in and out dont they
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I'm sure the employees of Chevron wouldnt care about a little
 grafitti on a feeway near tehir plant since that plant is dangerous and
 employees have been dying from careless explosions
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Not out of that entrace, not on that day, I can assure you. The guard
 booth was emtpy when we arrived.  it was Sunday.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well we are also sworn to protect property as well
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> okay, Soon2BCop.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> did you actually talk to your friend about this, or are you just
 going on his good reputation?  i mean, what did he say happened?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I talked to him about what happened. He did not however mention a
 lawsuit.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> But freeways are all covered with grafitti, I havnt seen one taht
 isnt so it seems hardly a thing to risk a riot over
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who is to say the protestors wouldnt have did other damage?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Besides ,just because it exists does it make it right?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> protestors don't generally have the cash to rent a large piece of
 the sky by taking out billboard advertising, so sometimes graffiti is a good
 way to get a message across, i think
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> Buts isnt teh effect of an arrest at a protest an escalation of
 violence and wouldnt you expect that to cause MORE property damage
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> So you're saying because this crowd appears hostile they should be beaten
 , peppersprayed and taken into preventative custody. all for the hypothetical
 protection of property?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> mx-, no thats not whay IM saying but nice job putting words in my
 mouth
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> After all, your kind is excellent at that
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> whats "your kind"? protesters?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> All Im actually saying is, that picture and that whole page needs
 to be removed
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> What if that was you or someone you know?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there are pcitrures up tehre and posts attacking people we know
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I would probably try to present a clearly reasoned
 counter-argument and post it, which you haven't done
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> These pieces of shit are calling him a pig, and making remarks
 from everything from his temper, intelligence, weight
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> the police had to be videotaping that. It was a rather large
 confrontation that was expected ahead of time. Why not post some snippits
 from those videos that prove your point?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont recall every detail he told me. These punks know what
 happened. 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> They instigated the shit and think they are coy enough to turn it
 around and make Sweeney look like the bad guy
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> You have been talking in here about 'their' rhetoric, but your
 posts are nothing but anti-protestor rhetoric.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> Tell your side of the story on the site.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> "those scumbags etc.." doesnt really convince people it comes across
 as something that makes people dislike you more
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> It is really not my situation. For one thing, I am not with RPD,
 and I rarely see Sweeney since I moved a couple years ago
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I have not seen the video
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> let him post then
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I agree that there are some really stupid comments on the site
 about your friend, but some people did actually tell them to shut up and
 stick to the facts
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well they failed there as well
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> actually, it seems like a kind of success to me -- intelligence
 over foolishness.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> No mention of the juvenile chants, or middle fingers, or rock that
 initially hit his vehicle as he pulled up
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> what are teh facts, you dcould at least post how you see protests if
 you dont know the details of this incident
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> What are these rocks you keep talking about?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im just going by what he told me
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> I almost wish there had been rocks, that would've have been worth
 videotaping.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> which is 5 times more believable than the kid's stories posted
 there
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well half of them are kids posting so what do you expect, its like
 any other message board in that way
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Youre funny mx-. If you think you can do a better job, sign up. 
 A lot of departments are hiring right now
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> heh. Where can i find a good police academy around here?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im gonna get a bite to eat. Ill be back in a second to wrap this
 up
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if you have pictures etc.. that can clarify things post those or find
 someone who has them to post them 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but name calling (even at those claling you names) doesnt really
 resolve things
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> or at least post some kind of defence which is better than "he
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> 's a good guy and would never do anything bad"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I posted what I thought about "protests" like this
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> where?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> but nothing about this specific incident
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its trendy b.s. for upper class white kids who have nothing better
 to do and want a cross to bear
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> nothing factual, anyway
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> or a "cause" to feel like they are doing something
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> proetsts are protests I guess but you probably sympathize with some
 relatively violent protests in other countries
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i saw a lot of old working class people barfing from tear gas in
 Quebec city, they don't fit the mold your're talking about, though.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Go put on your Rage Against the Machine CD and brood over how bad
 you have it.
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> like, a 75 year old man
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well stupidity knows no age
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> apparently
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> My question is simply who posted that photo
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> thats the steriotype, but there was justa huge protests by French
 cops
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> were there simply 50,000 stupid people there or could there
 perhaps be something wrong with the way our society is moving?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who is "anonymous cop watcher"
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> its an anonymous site, nobody knwo who posts things
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if it were not anonymous people would feel less free to express
 themselves. 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> just like how the CNN message board is anonymous
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> cowards eh
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> and the yahoo message board is anonymous
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> There is a way to know who posts it. 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> not always, I mean you wouldnt post your email to teh site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And if you are in the tech field, you could find out
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> what's your name?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you get spam, hate mail etc...
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, we drop server logs so unless teh FBI were to start recording
 who is hitting our site (which tehy have threatened us with) we cant tell you
 who posts something
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> In fact we don't even keep logs to begin with, so we don't even have to
 drop them.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well you should
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but if the FBI has anonymous pin trap authority tehy could tell you
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Can posts not be deleted then? 
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> You should contact the Oakland FBI office - they have a file on indymedia
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> Chuck Espizito, I think
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> (that may be spelled wrong)
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who is that
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> somebody said that was enough
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> teh FBI agent who contacted us about teh site a few months ago
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> So if you run the site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You can delete posts
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> even if you dont know who posted it
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> we remove duplicate posts and spam  but aside from that nothing is
 removed from the site
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> or everyone who is offended will want something removed
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> There is a strict policy that the editorial collective reach consensus to
 hide cases spam, etc.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> thats fine.  
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> You can contact the editorial collective via e-mail - contact info is on
 the site.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> leave it up if you think its so cute
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but it seems liek a harmless post, teh people who posted feel what
 the yfeel and you can respond to it to convince tehm otherwise
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Your attitude will catch up with you
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its not a harmless post
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> it has his picture posted on it for one thing
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there are many protesters who have asked for things attacking them to
 be removed and we havnt removed those things
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> scan through teh site there are crazy posts accusing people of all
 kinds of things
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> one of teh leaders of Earth First has been having posts on teh site
 making fun of him and claiming he has a minivan and its still on the site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> whoever that is, isnt out on the street 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> If there is no truth to it why shoudl he be offended
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and his safety isnt compromised by crap like this
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont even know if he knows it on here
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2001/11/109284.php
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well the chance of someone finding an old post on our site is low
 unless they are looking for it and peopel have videos and pictures of your
 friend so the site seems pretty harmless
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well what goes around comes around. Those scumbags will learn.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you found it since google has it archived I guess, but google also
 archives pictures so you would have to contact Google to remove the picture
 if you wanted it off their image archive
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> learn what?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> not to pick on cops?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if cops overreact at a protest it increases violence towards cops
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> not to disrespect cops, accuse them of false allegations
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> try to ruin a man's reputation etc
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> is his reputation ruined
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He should have fired some bean bags into those assholes
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> Do you guys learn to talk like this in cop school or something?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> and tehn he would have gotten in more trouble froma law suit
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> It may be I really dont know
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> and people would be more violent at teh next protest
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> I can't believe the guy gets out of his cruiser and starts shoving people
 with cameras, and doesn't think it'll come back to him somehow...
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> confrontations are like that, you hit someone and they wan to hit you
 back. If they cant the anger builds and things get worse for everyone
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I cant believe these pieces of shit show up to intentionally
 antagonize and cause a confrontation
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but cops are trained for situations liek that so one would hope they
 would knwo how not to take it personally
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and dont tell me that doesnt happen because Ive seen it and heard
 about it time and time again
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> We do let a lot slide off
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> it happens all the time, even firefighters in New York, but whats the
 point
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> that does happen once in a while, maybe -- but do cops never, ever
 start anything?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> ever?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But when you are there in a highly emotional and volatile
 situation
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and you have a bunch of morons chanting shit like Off Pigs at you
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you should be trained for that, shouldnt you
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> sometimes its hard not to let it get to you
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I mean its a protest
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yeah but life isnt a textbook kid
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> it wasnt exactly dangerous for the cops was it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> The bottom line is, you arent going to win. ALl you are doing is
 screwing yourself 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I'm sure rading a crack house would have been a lot more dangerous
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Dealing with disparaging remarks in a nonviolent manner should be part of
 police training these days..
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> It could be
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You do not know that
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> no, having respect for your police department should be part of
 being a citizen
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> probably nobody in the protest had a gun, and the risk of real
 violence seemd low
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> As I said, I was aware that I would be in unpopular situations
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> its a protest, when peopel protest they are angry
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But having people throw crap at you, threaten you, etc.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> That shit dont fly with me
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and it doesnt fly with many other cops either
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> I don't think the police dept was there out of respect for the citizens;
 so it should hardly expect better from folks on the street.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I mean if that had been a packed community in a city, uncontrolled
 behavior by cops could have started a riot and it could have been dangerous,
 tahts why I would expect cops to be trained in some sortof anger management
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> We are
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> This is a hard job 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Do you know what it takes to do this?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You have to be calm and patient one minute
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> aggressive and assertive the next
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> yep, but I would think raidinga drug dealers house or dealing witha
 murderer would be a lot higher stress then a few kids with signs?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Underpaid
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> it takes both mental and physical strength
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its those kids with the signs that are out to give the entire
 profession a bad name with their exaggerated bs
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> Oaklans PD are now making up to 80000 under tehir new contract so I
 would hope they we been trained to deal with a small protests and a little
 name calling
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> people appreciate the police when the police are there to protect
 them -- but when the police show up, "just following orders" to break up a
 completely legal demonstration which they feel strongly about, police have to
 expect that they're making very few friends
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> controling the populace does take skills that most people don't have;
 that's why people have high expectations for their officers and tend to get
 upset when they are victimized.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> So if you agree that it takes skills that most dont have
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and that we should be held to a higher standard
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> why are we not treated that way in the media or from assholes like
 these protestors?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I do tech stuff and peopel still yell at me at work
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Do they ?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Do they call you scum? 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> pussy?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> nazi?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> fat ass?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> pig?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> "teh server crashed you scumbag go fix it before I stick my foot up
 your ass" you know things like that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hello
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> I think I am an overnight sensation right now!!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> make threats on your life?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: are you a police officer?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> yes
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Where?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> entrant officer
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> I mean, what city?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I really dont care to say
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> oh
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i saw you on here earlier
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but i just missed you
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> his name is john from kc.rr.com wherever that is
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i wanted to hear what you have to say
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> how did you know that?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> we could mail you the chat so you could catch up?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> type /who
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I thought this wasnt logged? hmm
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> well, type /who is vitaly into my irc client and find out :)
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> another lie?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: your IP address is shown on the irc chat, everyone's is
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> this is irc not the site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> well my name isnt John Doe, just FYI there genious
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> whoa!
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its so hostile in here
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> with irc its a 2 way connection so peopel can type who and see you ip
 address
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why is that?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well I came in here to ask politely for them to remove a post or
 at least a photo
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> did you post the photo?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> no
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> cuz otherwise, we cant remove it
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> rr.com is in VA
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why would you possibly want us to take that down?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> but its a photo that could compromise the safety of an officer
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> as an upstanding officer, i would imagine you want to spread
 information about bad apples
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> who might tarnish the good name of the police
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> police brutality is something we must all work to stop
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> z, what the hell are you doing
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> cops or not
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> right, Soon2BCop? you do want to help stop police brutality, right?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it is illegal, after all
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i dont understand. why would someone sworn to uphold the law want to
 prevent people from exchanging information about possible crimes?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> brutality yes. someone getting a boo boo on their wrist from a too
 tight hand cuff....or any other one of a thousand b.s. suits filed against
 police, no
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> butch, thats not whats going on at this site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and if you think it is, you need to pull your head from your
 rectal region
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hm. the way i understand it from hearing about it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> officer attacked a photographer
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats more like a story you hear from russia or something
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> thats not the whole story though
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but that is important
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and thats what pisses me off
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you want to find out the truth, right?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it seems from the video that was shown at a public screening here
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> this officer was out of control
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I know the truth
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> that's not acceptable police behavior
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and everyone -- even police -- should work to stop that
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> what are you talking about public screening
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dont you agree?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> what public screening
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> What public screening
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> There was at least one screening in berkeley, maybe others.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> there is tons of video from that day
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> and videos get mixed together and show all over the world, you cant
 forget about that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you probably wont see it on 'cops' though
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Fuck you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why the hostility?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i thought we were on the same side
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> fighting abusive police officers
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> There is a highschool videographer who is just learning about digital
 video, we are trying to get her footage of the incident online.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you know what they say -- a police officer must have control of a
 situation at all times
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but if they dont even have control of their temper, how can they do
 their job?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i know you agree since you are a good cop
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> youre a cocky little fucker
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hey!
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Why are good cops so protective of the bad ones?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats not appropriate 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Id love to see you live in a society without a law enforcement
 presence
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i'm trying to be polite and answer your questions about the site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you piece of shit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you are being very hostile
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> No you are not, you are being a smart alec
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> perhaps i was wrong
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> perhaps you arent a good cop
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> This is why there shouldnt be "photographers" taking pictures at
 crap like this
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Is it a protest or a carnival? 
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> exactly, thats why there will always be photographers there
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Because there is  no telling where those photos could end up
 scumbag
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it was a protest against the murderers at chevron
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> well i know one place they will be
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and that is a court of law
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> So you're suggesting that only the police should have the right to
 witness and document events on a public street?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> when the lawsuit is brought against the richmond pd
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its not that we are afraid of misconduct, its that they could end
 up on a site like this
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> or some other anti cop site which could put is in danger
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> And what kind of site is it, in your words?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> There is not going to be a lawsuit. It will get thrown out
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "anti-cop site"
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> what is that
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> that is that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> can you show me an example
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Can you show me an example of an "Anti-Cop" site?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> I have never seen one.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you know what I am talking about
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> You mean sites which document and witness police brutality?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> that's not anti-cop
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> that's anti corruption
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> there are not that many incidents of brutality
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha, thats where you are wrong, Soon2BCop 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> its overexaggerated, sensationalized media crap
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> that makes a good story
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> No its not where I am wrong
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there are cases that go over the line you will have to admit S2BC
 liek the man in New York who was sodomized with a plunger in a police
 bathroom
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> One bad story and its blown out of proportion and taints us all
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yet if we were to stereotype like that, you people would be
 pissing your pants
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and the oakland riders
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and ramparts
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dozens of police found dealing drugs, stealing drugs, framing people,
 killing people
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats just in the last year
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> that incident hardly seems blown out of proportion, maybe it shouldnt
 taint other cops, but how can you justify sodomizing someone witha plunger
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> every year these stories come out
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its funny you that is the one thing you people love to whine about
 (profiling) yet that is exactly what you do to us
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> prove 'us'
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> wrong then
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> who said profiling? i said dealing drugs, stealing drugs, framing
 people, killing people
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not justifying that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you said it isnt widespread but obviously it is
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> ramparts
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> riders
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> every couple years, a big scandal hits
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and things are shaken up and its back to business as usual
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Where are all the stories about the thousands of heroic acts
 Officers perform on a daily fuckin basis?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Huh?
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> Huh are we commie-bashing again?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You dont hear about that shit do you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> drugs are still on the streets
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> yeah and so are losers like you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> no. a heroic cop is one who turns in the bad cops
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and there arent very many of those
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well you do hear happy cop stories in teh mainstream media thats all
 they have had on since 9/11
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> s2bc, indymedia is there for anyone, including you, to post news.  you
 can post as many articles about police heroism as you want.
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> And it won;'y be removed, even if a "scumbag" complains.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Just take Sweeney's picture down
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Thats all I fuckin asked
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> sorry, we have no control  over that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we're just hanging out in this irc channel
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why do you care so much about sweeney?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you dont even know him
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> right?
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> right is freaked out like a cartoon character seeing stars, the left
 is, well, the left
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> why do you care I mean you knwo him from school and live halfway
 across the country
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He should have broken those fuckin cameras
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and knocked some sense into some of you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats not very professional
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Are we supposed to take you seriously?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> tehn he would have to pay big fines and have his reputation really
 ruined, right?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Because I went on several ride alongs with him when I lived out
 there
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and had a few classes with him
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> oh so you did live out here huh
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and I still talk to him occasionally 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And he doesnt deserve this bullshit
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I seriously still cant believe this
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you went to cop school here and then moved the Kansas?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> What did you see on those rides, a lot of scumbags to knock sense into
 eh?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why would he be so angry that day? do you have any insight?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> unless he does deserve it, in which case he deserves it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He was very cool, and very professional
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> thats what I saw
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it doesnt seem like he was that day
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> how can you defend him without even knowing what happened?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> but yeah he doesnt take a lot of shit
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and he shouldnt
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I know what happened
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> for all you know he could have been completely in the wrong
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> he seemd like something was bothering him, maybe a divorce or
 something non protest related? That would probably make people understand and
 displike him less.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> how could you know? you only talk to him occasionally
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> since at least some of us have seen the video
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and you live so far away
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i think we're better qualified to state what happened
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont think you are
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why not?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Apparently sweeney claims he was under a hail of rocks that day??
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you dont talk to him, you live far away, you havent seen the video
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> all you have seen is one picture
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I think you are some jackass with a chip on your shoulder that is
 getting off on ruining a cop's career
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> all i saw was a hail of rain, and pepperspray
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I talk to him probably a dozen or so times a year
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but you dont even know! how can you defend him without even knowing
 what happened?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats ridiculous
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if he didnt do anything wrong why would it hurt is career
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and we email occasionally
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and I have heard about this incident
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> oh and i suppose he happened to tell you all about this protest huh
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> yeah right
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you're just remembering it right now huh
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I said that earlier jackass before you were even in here
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But again, you dont seem interested in being bothered with facts
 or truth
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but really how has his career been hurt?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and he wrote you an email: "today there was a protest. i acted so
 calm and professional, you should have seen me!"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> yeah thats what he said fucknut
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> *we* arent interested in facts and truth??
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you havent seen the video, you got one random email and saw a picture
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and your mind is made up
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> again.....wrong
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> now who is interested in facts and truth
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I have talked to him since then
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Because its political Zoe
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "political Zoe"?? what is that
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> whats political?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> If this thing really comes to fruition they could make an example
 out of him to make it appear as though they are zero tolerance against
 "unprofessional behavior" on the part of their PO's
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Regardless of whether or not he is guilty, it just depends on what
 the public believes
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> facts and truth - and commentary - is what indymedia is all about.  So if
 officer sweeney has information to add he should post it, or else ignore it. 
 One can't simply sweep under the rug all of the observation, video and
 photography.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> As I said, that Record button isnt hit when the protestors are
 asking for trouble
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> asking for trouble?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> why, what happened?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> After all thats the reason they show up., to be the "poor victim"
 and get a good story for their friends
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Actually we have all of the marching ans speechifying on video too.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Get real. Most of the community is catching onto these little
 games
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well, this site hardly seems to be a big thing changing the publics
 mind, we have the story we dont have the story teh peopel of Richmond will
 hardly notice. But if the PD is willing to make an example of an innocent man
 , I think you have bigger issues than us.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I have wasted enough time here. As I said, what goes around, comes
 around
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: it isnt our fault, we cant take it off the site
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I hope one day some piece of shit tries to ruin your life and your
 rep.
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> ok, just don't shoot the messenger.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> your going to run over here from Kansas and attack us, what does that
 mean?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: together, we can stop police brutality
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> No Im not coming over there to attack you smart ass
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I just mean people reap what they sew
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and ogranizations like this juvenile and flat out ridiculous
 causes will come back to bite you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: i dont understand why you arent more enthusiastic about
 identifying problem officers
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> liek ending up stationed in teh middle of Kansas City, you prolly
 have it harder than your friend
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> chevron is a ridiculous cause?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> they are killing people in richmond with their pollution
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> How do you know where I am from
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and they hire death squads in nigeria to kill activists
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i dont think thats such a juvenile cause
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: your IP address is recorded here
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why did you look up where Im from?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> as we have already mentioned
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it says on your ip address
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> So how does that tell you where I am
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> mkc-...
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> let me guess... missouri side of kansas city?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> mkc?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> sorry thats in Missouri, not Kansas woops
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> So how do I see that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its a secret
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont see any addresses of anybody
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> only special agents get to know
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> are you a special agent?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> ask some FBI officers thney might get trained in the secrates of irc
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats more NSA i think
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> irc? 
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> i heard irc was oldest and most standard form of chat on the internet
 or all the bad advice you have bandwidth for
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Are you being funny
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its funny because see NSA knows what IRC is but FBI doesnt
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> get it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so the an FBI agent, an NSA agent and a rabbi walk into a bar
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> stop me if youve heard this one
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> How do see the addresses 
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> close your eyes
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and say abracadabra
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im glad you think this all so fuckin funny
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hey you are being rude
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> youre a fuckin piece of shit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so dont blame us
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you know that
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I'm actually really glad I showed up for tech advice
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well your on a PC so that makes it harder for you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> what did i say?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Little computer geek
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> if you can use yahoo search you can probably learn irc
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you think youre so god damn cool
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Grow the fuck up
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hey, i dont know why you are so angry
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> naw we know we are losers, but we pretend it makes us less sepressed
 about the whole being a geek thing
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we're just innocent bystanders trying to give you information
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why cant you answer a fucking question
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> most people won't even talk to cops
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> without a warrant
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, if your on a PC, the commands arent teh same as UNIX
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> anyways none of us use an address which has a geographical
 identification in it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Thats not true. Thats what people like you wold like to believe,
 but the truth is, most of the community and citizens support us and
 appreciate our service
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> How did you see mine
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: not really. everyone i know hates the police, or at least
 doesnt trust them
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats not just me and my friends
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Well maybe its time to find new friends
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but my family, their extended family, their friends
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> or you could stop being a cop
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> people hate teh police but act nice to them because they dont want
 tickets etc...
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> just about everyone
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> everyone knows the cops are there for one thing
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> which is protecting rich criminals
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> like the murderers at chevron
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why would I quit? I love this job
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and wouldnt want to do anything else
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> what do you like about it, if your new your prolly just being a meter
 maid
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its a very important job that few are qualified or able to do
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> you should try the community relations department, you're doing a
 great job
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> That's probably what the chevron CEOS say
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: haha
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> so the people who are able to do it need to do it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> no wwhich part is the critical part
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> writing parking tickets?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Actually you start out straight on patrol
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and responding to calls here
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> is that why so many innocent people are shot in the back by cops?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> inexperienced patrols?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You have to get certified to do traffic jackass. I know that seems
 like the low end of the totem pole, but you have to actually get certified to
 shoot radar
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> speeding? they cant start an entry level cop out with anything
 dangerous they wouldnt have the training
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> what about shooting the people?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You train with a FTO for months moron
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> need certification?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> shooting the people?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are talking out of your ass again
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> in the back
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Thats a fuckin lie
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Isn't that what the guns are for?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it is?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> that's never happened? exit wounds in front?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> seems those riots in cincinnati started when officer roach shot
 someone in the back
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> The guns are there for protection and safety of us and you
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> its because those radar guns are dangerous, they cause cancer (tehre
 was a suit by cops who cliamed tehy were causing testicular cacner becasue of
 where tehy were located)
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> seems like there's always riots against police brutality
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> must be more of that media hype
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> unless we're "scumbags" like the majority of the population?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> who aren't cops
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> ?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> it aint the majority
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> how big a minority, then?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> This is bullshit. You people wont listen to anything.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> everyone hates meter maids, now that you have to admit?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: you ever hear of Copwatch?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its a group that goes out in patrols too
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but they are armed with videocameras
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and they monitor police activity
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are not gonna get shit on Sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and then bring lawsuits against brutality when possible
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its really effective.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> somehow they are able to capture so much illegal police activity on
 video
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im sure it is. 
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> just by going out and watching
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> Sweeney will get shit on himslef, if he cant control his temper his
 career will probably be runied when he mouths off to his superiors
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Get a fuckin life
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Do something worthwhile
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> actually Soon2BCop 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Morons like you are ruining this country
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> the other cops there were talking shit on sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> they were pissed at him for creating such a scene
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one cop is on video saying that it just makes his job harder
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so not all cops are behind sweeney
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> the ones who know what theyre doing are
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> another cop on video said that it was cops like him who give richmond
 pd a bad name
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> "code of silence"?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it seemed like they were all pretty pissed at him
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> no its cops like him that give PO's a bad name
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> he didnt have many friends on the force that day
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> by not having any balls
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> whatever
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> i think whatever is needed by various corporate clients
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it was pretty funny
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont believe you 
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> what? its on video!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You have said nothing truthful yet
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean, sweeney must have not seen the 4-5 videographers there that
 day
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> another cop is on there saying "i know chevron are murderers but its
 my job"
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> it does seem that he might have blown it.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well, he cant contol his temper that could risk your life if you were
 his partner ina real dangerous situation like where people had guns
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> yeah cops dont like "loose cannons"
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> maybe we can get a segment on the indymedia satellite show, then even
 people in kc can see it.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> if you have to depend on your partner, and your partner isnt
 dependable
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> yeah kc, if you have satellite
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you can watch the video on cable
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I would be honored to ride alongside Sweeney any day
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> he's better than a lot of cops that are currently on my dept.
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> why do you look up to him so much? is he a relation?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> he does have nice biceps, i'll admit that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: yeah really!! you kiss his ass a lot
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> the richmond PD arent comming to us and complaining
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not "kissing his ass"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But I do look up to him, he taught me a lot and has been a good
 friend
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> if he taught you everything you know
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and we are a lot alike
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you better find a new mentor
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one who can handle stress
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one who doesnt fall apart when things get rough
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I didnt think it was possible to get pissed off in a stupid chat
 room
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> the protesters were dealing better with the stress than he was and
 tehy had more at stake
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But you mr. butch have proved me wrong
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i'm ex-military, so i know that people who cant control their anger
 are not valued members of a military team
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> okay. i'm not ex-military. but i had ya going for a second, huh!!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are ex military......right
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> No you didnt actually
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> glad we could help you harness the power of teh Internet
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: perhaps this will all be good 
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I knew it was another lie,.....you just decided to not to keep
 that one going
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> officer sweeney can get the training he needs
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and perhaps even some counseling paid for by the city of richmond
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He doesnt need fucking counseling
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> counseling is nothing to be ashamed of
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there were exmiltary people in teh protesters though I know of a few
 who had been in Nam
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> lots of people have trouble managing the pressure
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are still sitting their making fun of him like you even know
 him
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You dont know him or me
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> or what makes a good cop
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i am not making fun of him
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but i am a concerned citizen
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> richmond pd is known for brutality
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You arent concerned
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so citizens must be vigilant
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are a low life
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> after the counseling Maybe officer sweeney can go on a cop watch ride.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> now where did that come from??
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> perhaps you need anger management techniques too
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You people think that you dont have to obey the law
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> like check this out
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> breathe in thru your nose
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> out thru your mouth
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> that somehow you are above that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and again
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Fuck you
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you cant even debate or discuss anything
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well so do some PD, but we get in trouble when we break the law
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you think cops dont have to obey the law
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> without acting like a little smart ass bitch
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we are making sure that everyone obeys the law
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i always obey the law
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and i expect the cops to as well
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i dont understand why you are interested in defending a cop who might
 have made a mistake?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> great your getting angry online how coudl you ever deal with anything
 real as a cop??????????
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You know I was hoping after Sept. 11 some of you people would wake
 up
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But I guess not
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> seriously, Soon2BCop 
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well teh people who sent the anthrax were miltray types so now we
 want to protest more
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im doing just fine thank you very much
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> if you have anger issues, and you are out on the streets with a gun,
 thats a real danger
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I was one of the top graduates in my academy
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and Im almost done with my probationary period
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but what do they test?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> real world experience?
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> goodness, this doesn't bode well for the rest of your class...
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> like without anger management there is NO WAY you coudl do undercover
 work
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you know cops have one of the highest burnout rates of any career?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one of the highest alcoholism rates?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one of the highest cardiac disease rates?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> one of the highest domestic abuse rates of any profession?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you should calm down now
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> while you still can
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> that is not true
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> highest smoking rate is actually nurses
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> stress rates maybe
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> oh but it is true and i can even cite the study!
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> robin magee's "myth of the good cop"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and I can cite one that disputes it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> okay, cite it
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> its the combination of sitting still and waitingand dealiing with
 stress that greatly increases teh risk of heart attacks
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and dont say "officer sweeney told me"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont have it memorized it but I have researched it
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> pause
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I think it was in a book I have actually
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> yeah, just let me know when you "find" your book
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You can manipulate stats to prove any side of any argument
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Id think a great bullshitter like youreself would know that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> no one can deny that cops have one of the highest stress levels of
 any career
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> which would lead to all the other things i have mentioned, so common
 sense is on my side
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but i'm just saying, you seem to be a really angry person
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> butch: i think he may have just complimented you there
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean, this is just irc you know
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you're blowing a gasket
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> This may be IRC
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> except drug delears, I heard they had about the same stress level as
 cops (no wait in many city its the same people, my bad)
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> But you are trying to humiliate a buddy of mine on your little
 fuckin site
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> in oakland, if you want some drugs, you know the pager #... 911
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: *we* are trying to do what now?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Thats real funny
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> anyone can post on the site, i'm sure we've explained that to you
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> any other jokes you got up your sleeve?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it isnt *our* site
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we are just in the irc channel here
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Maybe you should pull your head out of a rap song and get in the
 real world
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> oh you like rap?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and realize we are on your side, we are not the god damn enemy
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and deserve a little fuckin respect
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i am against corruption and abusive police
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and you seem to be very forgiving of them
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so i dont think we are on the same side
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Who is the enemy?
<font color="green">&lt;sfkid&gt;</font> the enemy is the corporations, the G8 and the fascist cops...everyone
 is clear about that in the movement
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I am not forgiving anyone
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you are defending sweeney without even seeing our side of the story!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not even trying to discuss the profession in general
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we are telling you there is video
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and you just deny it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I am saying what you are trying to do to Sweeney is bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> *we* are not trying to do anything to sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i enver heard of him before i saw that video
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and there were hundreds of people at that screening soooo 
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it isnt fair to pin it on us
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> hundreds huh
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> any chance you could get that video up to Canada?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Where is this video
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> who has it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> what? you must not have noticed all the tens of thousands of people
 at protests
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Which one, there are so many.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> in genoa it was 300,000
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> we're organizing a major film screening, and I wouldn't mind
 showing it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> so we definitely get a few hundred to a screening
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Wait a minute
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> ooh! a screening canada!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> dont fucking do that
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> there is also a screening planned in london
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> that is not cool
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> sure, Toronto's a big city, lots of people would be interested
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: dont you know? there is international solidarity on stuff
 like this
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> do some cross cultural cop comparisons
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> everyone around the world is amazed at the brutality of american
 police
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> what do you mean international solidarity
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> that is a lie
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean, when someone fucks with the movement in one place
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it is supported all aroudn the world
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I've got friends all across the country
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You are all probably 17 year old little outcasts trying to form a
 common bond
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha, you wish
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> s2bc sounds like you don't want the truth to get out after all...
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> oh, and my girlfriend is currently in germany...
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean, that WTO action took place in over 50 cities around the world
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> because the WTO was held in qatar to prevent any protests from
 happening there
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> so is Harald, who works for the left-wing press there
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You dont go around showing some half ass one-sided video to ruin a
 cops career
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it was held in solidarity with protesters in Nigeria,
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I dont care about fucking Nigeria
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it isnt one-sided, if sweeney wants to do an itnerview i'm sure it
 could be arranged
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why should he be drug through that
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He did nothing wrong
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> because he's a cop and its his job
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He asked the photographer to put the camera away
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> no, he attacked the photographer
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and it is on video
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC why dont you like Nigeria? what did teh Nigerian people ever do
 to you?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Why is it all the shit said and done against police is always
 conveniently not on those videos?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Who do you people think you are kidding anyway?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Youre jokes
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> what shit done against the police?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> And you will always be fucking jokes
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> ANd Im telling you right now
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> the video shows sweeney arriving at the scene, jumping out of his car
 , and attackign a photographer
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You need to drop this bullshit on Sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> teh police ALWAYS videotape protests, dont tell me ALL the videos are
 one sided
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> *we* have nothing to do with sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> You've got your own major network shows like "cops" to show what a
 great bunch of guys you are...allow us our miserable fun, eh?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: admit it. you are sweeney and you're home for the holidaze
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> there were police at teh Richmond protest with video camers, get them
 to post some stuff online that contradicts what people are saying
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> fuck you
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> is there any chance we can get this thing translated into French?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> or at least subtitled?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> what are you really angry about?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: absolutely, i speak french
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> bien
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> bien sur
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> now, the real problem could be
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> Can't leave our Quebecois friends out of distro
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> no one is going to be interested in this shit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> is if people pick up on this case and start holding solidarity
 protests in other cities
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Not anyone who matters
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> or has a clue
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: there are plenty of people opposed to WTO and police
 brutality in defending it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Maybe a few  rejects like youreselves
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> millions of people worldwide
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> well, the Quebecois are noted for this kind of thing
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> and they hate Chevron, too
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> notice the huge riots in argentina the past week?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> they just overthrew their government
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> mostly to do with IMF/WB/WTO, exactly what we are talking about
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Sweeney should have beat the shit out of some of you and shoved
 those god damn cameras up your ass
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, but pissing people off wont help your cause, the more you piss
 people off teh more they fight back and really the cops have little chance
 against protesters thats why they always bring in the National Guard
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> the speeches, the free food, the signs, office sweeney chasing and
 attacking people are all in the video,  but we welcome more footage from the
 other side of the police line, let us know if you can help.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Ofc Sweeney could be internationall famous!!
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> We have little chance against protestors?? hahaha
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> alrighty, if you say so
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> yeah, a celebrity!
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> did he really pepper spray himself?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: the lawsuit will bring out a lot
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> why is it that in any major conflict you guys hide behind the
 military???
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i know they are planning on giving the video to local NBC, ABC, CBS
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> we are pretty big boys most of us
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I mean, that's the real hook for the mass audience
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and the video is REALLY indicting
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> officer sweeney looks totally out of control
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and do you realize what kind of physical and tactical training we
 go through?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> running around, screaming, etc
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> the training isnt very good
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> state police have better training
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, maybe but at anything big tehy hold you back and send in better
 trained people
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> Just another police brutality story, that's nothing
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> in fact, local police training is a hair above private security
 training
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> but if he really pepper sprays himself on video, that would get
 people interested
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> he does pepper spray himself also
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i saw that part of the video
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> did he mention to you whether he did that or not?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> in fact here's what happened
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> OUr training is extensive
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> a kid in the crowd sez
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Id love to see you try it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "take off that gunbelt and fight me like a man"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> See
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and then officer sweeney pepper sprays himself
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Thats fuckin bullshit right there
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and then runs into the crowd and grabs the person
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> "point the pepper spray at scumbags"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> This isnt the WWF
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and yells "thats illegal, threatening an officer!"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> It isnt about a fight or a match
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Its about keeping the peace
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC, teh National Guard wouldnt pepper spray themsleves since they
 get REAL training, thats why they tell you to go back hoem when things get
 rough
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: this was after sweeney had come and started attacking a
 bunch of people
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I always hear that shit....take off your badge and your gun pussy.
 ......
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> grow up
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> after he drew his gun on a crowd of unarmed people
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> stupid fucker
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> great training
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> there should be some kind of manual or something
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> because if we wanted to I guarantee you scrawny fucks wouldnt win
 in a fight
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "oh no! the protesters are yelling at me! i better pull my gun!"
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> you could probably read it, your typing skills are pretty good...
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> re: pepperspraying yourself - http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2001/10/105324
 .php
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> like those cops who shot little kids with a squirtgun
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "oh no! a 5 year old with a bright yellow plastic gun! i better shoot
 him!"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> apparently he didnt attack you good enough because you obviously
 didnt learn your lesson
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> he didnt attack me
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i wasnt even there
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> you always hear peopel yelling stuff liek taht at you????? I thought
 you said most people in Kansas City loved teh PD
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: maybe you can testify in the lawsuit against richmond pd
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> you people are sick
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> That picture funny to you mx-
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> you can be a "character witness"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> ?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> well at the screening they made a big deal out of their lawsuit
 against officer sweeney
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> on the video everyone is yelling "one forty nine! one forty nine!"
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I hate you motherfuckers
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> You will get whats coming to you
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean, drawing your gun on unarmed people?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats sick
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and cowardly
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> naw you really like us, we are making your Sunday night more exciting
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> that is why all the other cops were talking shit on sweeney
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and think of me laughing when it happens
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and thats why they would probably hang him out to dry if trouble
 comes down through a lawsuit
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> "you will get whats comming to you" soudns like a threat thats not
 very nice
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> they arent going to let his bad temper bring them all down
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> Apparently keeping the peace is about attacking people until they "learn
 their lesson".  maybe you can tell us the "lesson" straight up to avoid all
 the hassle.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> yeah Soon2BCop it is illegal to threaten people, even on irc
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Yeah I love to see a friend be totally slandered and his future in
 jeopardy
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> because of some punk kids who have a problem with police
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> it would appear that slander on this site is the least of your
 problems
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> You could always just beat the shit out of them and get away with it
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not threatening anyone
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> if they're going to take him to court
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I'm sure taht if he loses his temper his reputation is in greater
 risk from other things, get real!
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> his future is in jeopardy only because of his anger and
 unprofessionalism
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> being a cop does not mean doing whatever the fuck you want
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> he did what I would have done or any other cop
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> it means you get paid with OUR tax money, so you have to obey certain
 rules
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> and try to get control of the situation
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> if you cant obey those rules, you are fucking fired
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> there WAS control of the situation and the other cops are on video
 saying that
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Dont give me that we pay yoru salary bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Nah, you don't need to obey rules, case in point: Dan White
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> if he's been slandered, shouldn't he try to prove it to clear his
 good name?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> he was acting on his own and he was out of conrtol
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> If I got mad and yelled at my boss at work I'd get fired, if I yelled
 at a customer (I do consulting) I'd get fired ......
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> If you're a cop you can kill the mayor and a supervisor and get out in
 a few years
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> BEcause taxes need to be raised, you aint paying enough
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Cops love their twinkies
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> 1984: hehe
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He shouldnt have to dunbar
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: yeah well the unemployment line is where abusive cops go
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> why not?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Fuck you 1984
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Grow up
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and they pay a lot less
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> ?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i hear ex-cops can sometimes get a job bagging groceries
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> thats bullshit as well
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> We are in great shape for the most part
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> I apologize, I don't think all cops are like Dan White
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> There should be no shame in proving your good name if you did
 nothing wrong, no?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Again going on stereotypes......such hypocrites you are
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> great shape?
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> And I've talked to a bunch who I have respect for
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> innocent until proven guilty, all that jazz?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He shouldnt have to prove his good name asshole
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> your in great shape for a few years right out of school before you
 get old and cynical (its like that in all professions)
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> He did nothing fuckin wrong
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Who is Swooney or Sweeney or whoever?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> well then WHY WORRY?????
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> That's what we say all the time.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: drawing a gun on innocent people? attacking a journalist?
 pepperspraying random people? thats a LOT wrong if thats what he did
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> But we're "scumbags"?
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> An Officer and a friend of mine that they are trying to hang out
 to dry
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> with their stupid bullshit
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> *we* are not trying to do anything
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Uh okay that explains a whole lot
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we are just conversing with you or at least trying to 
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> I'm really sympathizing with you now, I'm not from the SF area

<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Quit fucking posting it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i forgot all about it until i saw Soon2BCop on irc
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> What will it take to get it removed?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: its everywhere, posting it here isnt doing anything more
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> We gotta get this server up here so we can repost this.
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Email the contact ?
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> it should be in Googles image archive by now, look there and tell
 them to remove it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: it is already posted at other IMCs
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> not just this one
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> no, no, I came for tech advice re:  new-IMC-Thunder Bay
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> re post what
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> wow if you go to google
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> I thought these conversations werent logged
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and search for "officer 149 richmond"
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> its the first thing to come up
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I'm going to email this conversation to everyone I know...
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> That should generate some interest in the matter.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i know there will be more screenings of that video in this city and
 others
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> There's been some very good writing here.  Stylish.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> like i said there is one planned for london

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> What's interesting about this thread, I just saw this, is that multiple
 people are confirming seeing this guy do illegal shit
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> But it's probably all hogwash and trumped up
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> wow pat sweeney!!

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Dear Officer #149
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> by notafuckinghippie November 12 2001, Mon, 2:09pm
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Dear Officer #149, 
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Way to kick some hippie ass! This is the best picture on the whole damn
 worthless sf.indymedia site. This officer is not a "pig" and I would like to
 thank him for devoting his life to serving his community (Although I'm sure
 the crazy protesters would call this a dis-service). 
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> And enough with making fun of this "Macho" guy. Obviously the skinny
 little hippies are jealous & need to stereotype this guy as the "dumb jock."
 It takes years in a gym to get into this kind of shape & since when is
 physical fitness a bad thing? 
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Ahah
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> I like how every anti-WTO person is a "hippie"
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> damn, a juvenile wanted for armed robbery.
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: now, do you have anything else? should we find a
 videographer to interview sweeney so his side of the story is out there?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> otherwise i dont think we can help you
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> S2BC is too afraid to talk once he found out "this is being logged"
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> That sounds reasonable
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> haha
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Put this on IndyMedia ;D
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> well this might have to be admissable in the lawsuit
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> we might reverse lokup his name send it to the Kansas City PD and get
 him in trouble
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> duh, of course its logged
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> the FBI are probably watching too
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and Soon2BCop, that IP address we keep talking about?
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> your ISP has subpeonable records which tie the IP address to the
 billing address on the account
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> shit tehy will at least who not to accept into tehir ranks if mr S2BC
 ever tries to move up in the world

<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> if that rally is Kansas City hes up pretty late and is prolly gonna
 fall asleep at the job Monday
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> this is the most enjoyable tech request i've ever made
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: hehe
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i certainly hope sweeney and/or his friends are not stalking us
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> I hear crap like this all the time and I can tell you about 2 % are
 legit. People buy into all the media hype and sensationalized story and use
 it as a way to escape responsibility. With all the negative press our
 profession has gotten over the last decade, I really find it hard to believe
 that an Officer, and especially Sweeney, just walks up and starts shoving
 someone. Give me a break. Most of these "protestors" just show up to let out
 some juvenile ag
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> From Soon2BCop
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> On the site
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> you get this often, or was this, like, a masterpiece?
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Maybe if cops quit shooting unarmed black men their profession wouldn't
 get negative press
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Just a passing thought
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: this is a first
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> there were some italian cops in here during G8
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> did u know officer sweeney was in All my Children?  http://www.turtle-run
 .com/eguide/july2001/episodeguide24.html
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> but they didnt go on and on and on like this one did
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> I mean, you guys aren't just being hospitable by entertaining a
 guest or soemthing, eh??
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> spilling all kinds of information about stuff they should say in
 public
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i mean SHOULDNT say in public
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we are reporters
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> independent media reportes
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we shoudl call richmond PD and get a statement from them
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> and kansas city mo PD and get a statement from them
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> we could easily build a cop bot AI based on ALICE, the guy was
 pretty repetitive
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> "rogue cops" are no funny matter
* 1984 chants "the whole world is watching" digitally
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: you've been quiet for 9 minutes!
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> come on, where's the bravado we know and love you for??
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> His brain kicked in
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> thats how people with bad tempers are
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> they just snap and then they dont think
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i saved it to a text file partway through just in case i had a
 crash
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> then when the rush goes away, they regret what they did
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> I think he may have been drunk so the beer finally wore off...
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> dunbar: excellent!!
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we all have logs
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> my sweetie actually IS in Germany, she's going to get a big kick
 out of this
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> phew
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i haven't laughed like that in a long time
<font color="red">&lt;mx-&gt;</font> does anyone mind if we e-mail the log?
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i think that's fantastic
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> post it as a story on the site
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> we've got to post this, it's pure genius
<font color="red">&lt;dunbar&gt;</font> i'd say cut it right at      mx-: i'm sensing a ping timeout any
 minute...
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> hey one thing though
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> we should change our names
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> i can do it
<font color="red">&lt;z&gt;</font> but it would be good to confirm the location of 65.28.12.131

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Wait
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Why a doctored transcript?

<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> 1984: doctored so that our handles are not in it
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> just search and replace, say, "fred" for all instances of "butch"

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Is that ethical?

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> <font color="purple">[01:00]</font> <font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> That's interesting. If we don't like the laws, the

 quite your profession?

 you or Sweeney would have a chance of being elected.

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> That's a contribution

<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> I could see one of two things
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: i was trying to help you and tell them not to send the
 shit out
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> 1) They don't bother, meaning the police force is corrupt
<font color="red">&lt;butch&gt;</font> Soon2BCop: but like i said, it will be hard to convince em
<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> sure you were
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> 2) You don't ever become a cop
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Justice!

<font color="blue">&lt;Soon2BCop&gt;</font> Im not gonna sit here and let you pieces of crap get under my skin
 
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> Soon2BCop, multiple people have video footage. Remember that. If he's
 truly innocent, it'll be reflected in the videos.
<font color="red">&lt;1984&gt;</font> But if he's guilty, you're shit out of luck, aren't you?
<font color="red">&lt;|&gt;</font> soon2bcop did you actually pass psychological screening??
