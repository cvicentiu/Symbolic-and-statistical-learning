This is an excerpt (first 20 pages) of a completed screenplay.

       "The Moonship" - screenplay by Derek Paterson.

        FADE IN:


        EXT. VENUS - DAY

        A nightmare vision of the surface of planet VENUS.  Ammonia
        lakes hiss and bubble, hurricane winds blast at 500 mph.
        Shafts of white-hot sunlight burst through the clouds like
        laser beams, causing the liquid ammonia to EXPLODE.

        A futuristic-looking FACTORY PLATFORM clings precariously to
        the side of a tall cliff.  A dozen drill shafts milk the
        planet of its most precious elements.

        Super:  VENUS MINING REFINERY #37


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Rows of cells on either side.  The windowless doors are all
        closed.  Slowly DOLLY toward the door at the far end of the
        corridor, as the unseen PRISONERS provide a chorus of
        complaints:

                              PRISONER #1 (O.S.)
                  Let me out of this dump!

                              PRISONER #2 (O.S.)
                  I'm starving!  Give me some food!  I
                  need some food!

                              PRISONER #3 (O.S.)
                  Open the door!  I got claustrophobia!
                  Open the door!

                              PRISONER #4 (O.S.)
                  Hey, someone call a plumber, my john's
                  backed up!

                              PRISONER #5 (O.S.)
                  Screw you, Greenberg!  Keep the noise
                  down!

                              PRISONER #6 (O.S.)
                  Get me a doctor, I need a doctor!

                              PRISONER #2 (O.S.)
                  Hey, I need food!  I'm starving to
                  death in here!

                              PRISONER #3 (O.S.)
                  Someone better open this door!

        The door slides OPEN to reveal dangerous psychopath CLINTON
        VAN HOOLIK.

                                                                2.


        If the roadmap of facial scars didn't give you a clue to Van
        Hoolik's nature then his staring, lunatic eyes surely would.

        His wrists are secured behind his back with cuffs.  Short
        ankle chains force him to shuffle rather than walk.  Two
        uniformed prison officers, ROBERTS and CHEN, manhandle him
        roughly toward his cell.

                              ROBERTS
                  Here ya go.  Home sweet home.

        Chen opens the cell door.  They throw Van Hoolik inside.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik sprawls on the floor, banging his face.  Chen
        SLAMS the cell door shut.


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts switches on a TV screen that shows Van Hoolik inside
        his cell.  He presses an intercom button.

                              ROBERTS
                  Judge let you off easy, Van Hoolik.
                  Don't matter any.  This time tomorrow
                  you'll be on your way to the Moon.
                  And good riddance.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik pushes himself up.  It's awkward, with his hands
        and his ankles secured, but he manages to sit on his bunk.
        He strains against the cuffs... bones SNAP... and suddenly
        his hands are free.  He throws the cuffs onto the floor.

        Van Hoolik inspects his torn and bleeding hands.  He grabs
        hold of his left hand with his right and gives the left a
        sudden wrench.  Broken bones CRACK into place.  He does the
        same with his other hand.  He shows no sign of feeling pain.

        C.U. the cuffs, lying on the floor.  They're electronic,
        remote controlled.  A light winks green and the cuffs SNAP
        open .  If Van Hoolik had waited just a few moments longer,
        he would have been free...


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts and Chen watch Van Hoolik on the TV screen.

                              ROBERTS
                  Dumb as rocks, and twice as stupid.


        INT. SORDELL'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        C.U. of a dog-eared romance novel entitled, "NEVER LOVE A
        SULTAN" with a cheap graphic of a leering turbaned prince
        holding a struggling beautiful blonde girl in his arms.

        WIDER so we see the reader.  MILES SORDELL, ruggedly handsome,
        inarguably intelligent despite his choice of fiction.  He
        lies on his bunk, reading.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik stares at his cell door.  Crazy as a loon.  But
        clever, too.  And now he's out for revenge.


        INT. SORDELL'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Sordell puts the book down and stares at his cell door.  He
        listens for a moment.  Then goes back to reading his book.


        INT. FACTORY CANTEEN - DAY

        WORKERS enjoy a breakfast of slop regurgitated by food
        machines that vomit onto the Workers' metal trays.

        Prison Transport Service officers MITCH DUNBAR (male) and
        KARYN MAINE (female) sit at a table on their own.  Dunbar is
        the senior officer, tough as steel.  Karyn's no rookie but
        compared to Dunbar she might as well be.

        Dunbar examines the slop he got out of the machine, twirling
        it around on his spoon before putting some in his mouth.

                              DUNBAR
                  Doesn't taste too bad.  Doesn't taste
                  too good, either.  You'd think they
                  could shape it into something that
                  looks like food.  Coat it with
                  breadcrumbs.  Serve it with a spicy
                  sauce.

                              KARYN
                  Maybe that's what they do upstairs
                  on Executive Level.  We're eating
                  with the lower classes, remember?

                              DUNBAR
                  I suppose you think that's my fault.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                4.


                              KARYN
                  We should have worn dress uniforms,
                  like I said.

                              DUNBAR
                  And I said no.

                              KARYN
                  Can't you squeeze into yours?

                              DUNBAR
                  Here's how it works.  I'm Senior
                  Grade.  You're Junior Grade.  That
                  means you give me respect at all
                  times.  And we do what I say.

                              KARYN
                  Sir yes sir.

                              DUNBAR
                  You looked at the prisoner list?

                              KARYN
                  Haven't seen it yet.

        Dunbar takes a datapad from his breast pocket and slides it
        across the table for Karyn to pick up.

                              DUNBAR
                  13 scumbags.  That's my lucky number.

                              KARYN
                  How come everyone else thinks it's
                  unlucky?

                              DUNBAR
                  Everyone else is wrong.

        She reads the datapad...

                              KARYN
                  Jesus, no.  Not him.  Not that guy.

                              DUNBAR
                  I'm guessing you're looking at Clinton
                  Van Hoolik.

        C.U. of the datapad, showing VAN HOOLIK'S mug shot and
        history.  The word "MURDER" is highlighted several times.

                              KARYN
                  Is it true?  Did he really...?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                5.


                              DUNBAR
                  It's true.  Judge passed sentence
                  this morning.  Deportation to the
                  Moon.

                              KARYN
                  Why didn't they fry the bastard?
                  Jesus, what he did to those hookers...
                  The judge must be crazy.

                              DUNBAR
                  Van Hoolik deserves to die, no
                  argument there.  But being deported
                  to the Moon is the next best thing.
                  You don't know what it's like.  You've
                  only seen the surface, the colony
                  domes and the spacefield.  Down in
                  the ice tunnels... there are guys
                  who make Van Hoolik look like a saint.
                  They'll break him, literally and
                  figuratively.  Pass him around like
                  a bitch plaything.  You think he got
                  the soft option?  Nah.

                              KARYN
                  You really think so?

                              DUNBAR
                  I know so.  Justice comes in many
                  forms.

                              KARYN
                  What about this other guy?

                              DUNBAR
                  This time, I'm guessing you mean
                  Miles Sordell.

                              KARYN
                  Yeah, I mean Sordell.

        C.U. of the datapad, showing SORDELL'S mug shot and history.
        The words "DANGEROUS" and "SPECIAL FORCES" are highlighted.

                              DUNBAR
                  He used to be a soldier.  A good
                  one, from what I heard.  Then he
                  went bad.

                              KARYN
                  "Went bad"?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                6.


                              DUNBAR
                  Ignore the medals and commendations,
                  and especially the good looks.  Him
                  and some ex-Forces buddies hijacked
                  an ore freighter.  Sordell killed
                  two goldshields who caught up with
                  him.  He's no different from Van
                  Hoolik.

        Karyn ponders this news.  Dunbar ponders his dinner.

                              DUNBAR (CONT'D)
                  Or maybe a mayo dip.


        INT. SORDELL'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Sordell lies on his bunk, staring up at the ceiling.
        Pondering the mistakes he's made in life, like getting caught.
        He senses movement outside his cell, looks at the door.


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts and Chen use a hostess trolley to serve packaged
        meals to their prisoners.  Roberts stops at the first cell.
        Activates the intercom.

                              ROBERTS
                  Stand back, Greenberg.  Don't make
                  me use the stun gas.  You'll be puking
                  for a week.

        INSERT TV SCREEN:  Greenberg, a skinhead with tattoos,
        retreats from the door and sits down on his bunk.

        Roberts nods to Chen, who slips a food package through the
        rectangular "letterbox" slot at the base of the door.  They
        continue down the corridor, putting food into half a dozen
        cells in the same manner.

        Roberts reaches Sordell's door.  Activates the intercom.

        INSERT TV SCREEN:  Sordell sits quietly on his bunk.

                              ROBERTS (CONT'D)
                  That's right, Sordell, you're a model
                  prisoner, never cause any trouble.
                  Let me go call the judge and appraise
                  him of your good behavior.  Maybe
                  he'll let you stay on Venus.  That's
                  what you're hoping, right?

                                                                7.


        INT. SORDELL'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Sordell doesn't react to Roberts' baiting.


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Chen puts a food package through Sordell's door.

        Roberts strolls over to Van Hoolik's cell.  He's really going
        to have fun with this one.  He bangs his fist on the door.

                              ROBERTS
                  You awake in there, Van Hoolik?

        INSERT TV SCREEN:  Van Hoolik sits cross-legged on his bunk,
        in some kind of yoga trance.

        Roberts gestures to Chen, who gives him a food package.
        Both men grin from ear to ear.  Roberts wants to deliver
        this very special package himself.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        The package drops onto the floor, special delivery.  Van
        Hoolik slowly comes out of his trance.  He gets up, picks
        the package up and returns to his bunk to eat.

        C.U.  His hands tear open the silver foil, revealing the
        same kind of slop we saw in the canteen...

        A VENUSIAN MAGGOT erupts out of the slop!  It's an ugly purple
        worm thing with a mouth at both ends of its body.  Only six
        inches long, its needle teeth could easily strip Van Hoolik's
        fingers to the bone -- but he throws the package across the
        room before it can bite him.  The package hits the wall and
        falls to the floor, splashing slop everywhere.


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts and Chen laugh like a couple of schoolkids.

                              ROBERTS
                  Better not waste any food, Van Hoolik.
                  It's your last meal before the
                  Moonship takes off.  Maybe they won't
                  feed you as well as we do.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        The maggot writhes on the floor.  Van Hoolik puts his boot
        over it.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                8.


        He's gonna crush the maggot to paste for ruining his meal.

        But then he thinks about it... and takes his boot away.
        What have we here?  Has this killer experienced some crazy
        change of heart?  Over squishing a maggot?


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts and Chen watch the TV screen.

                              ROBERTS
                  You better kill that thing before it
                  kills you.  Venusian maggot gets
                  hold of you, it doesn't let go.
                  Just eats its way inside, and keeps
                  eating till you're dead.  Or maybe
                  you're looking for a new friend?
                  You ought to get on real well.  Same
                  species.  A pair of psycho killers.

        Roberts and Chen exit, laughing.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik squats down and stares at the maggot.  We don't
        know what thoughts are running through his warped head...
        but he sure does give the maggot due consideration.


        INT. LAUNCH BAY - DAY

        Our first glimpse of the Moonship, getting prep'd for launch.
        The vehicle's sweeping tail owes much to early Space Shuttle
        design:  control cabin up front, "passenger" accommodation
        amidships, cargo hold at the rear.  The "PRISON TRANSPORT
        SERVICE" logo decorates the hull.


        INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Windowless security cells to left and right, just like the
        Venus prison wing, except no TV screens or intercoms.

        Looking forward, we have crew cabins, then an airlock hatch
        that leads to the Control Cabin.  Looking back, we have PORT
        and STARBOARD external airlock hatches.  Then the airlock
        hatch that leads to the Cargo Hold.

        Karyn walks down the corridor, whistling.  The LIGHTS suddenly
        go out, leaving just a faint red glow from an emergency light.

                              KARYN
                  Aw, come on!  Not again!

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                9.


        She goes to the electrical breaker junction box and PUNCHES
        the panel cover.  Nothing happens for a moment... then the
        lights flicker back on.


        INT. CONTROL CABIN - MOONSHIP  DAY

        A two-seat pilot/co-pilot arrangement with plenty of space
        behind the seats.  There's also a hatch in the ceiling.
        (The space and the hatch will feature later.)

        Dunbar sits in his chair, running through pre-launch checks.
        The hatch behind him slides open.  Karyn enters.

                              KARYN
                  We got a launch window yet?

                              DUNBAR
                  Confirmed and approved.  2 hours, 37
                  minutes and counting.

                              KARYN
                  Were you going to tell me?

                              DUNBAR
                  I just did.

        Karyn shakes her head and exits.


        INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Karyn retraces her steps, still whistling...

        ...And REACTS as two men step into shot without warning.
        They're tall, bald, and wear loose-fitting robes.  Surgical
        scars are visible on the sides of their heads.  Their names
        are MUSTAFA and ALI.  They are Soul Brothers.

                              KARYN
                  Who the hell are you guys?

        A third figure appears.  The Soul Brothers step aside to
        reveal a woman, dressed like them.  She's bald and has scars,
        too.  Her name is NAYRAM.  She's a Soul Sister.

                              NAYRAM
                  They cannot speak.  They have taken
                  a vow of silence.

                              KARYN
                  You didn't?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               10.


                              NAYRAM
                  I have special dispensation from our
                  Chapter House.

                              KARYN
                  That's nice, but you're trespassing
                  aboard a Prison Transport Service
                  vessel.  I'm afraid I'm going to ask
                  you to leave.

                              NAYRAM
                  And if we do not leave?

        SNAP!  One second Karyn's hand is empty... the next she's
        armed with a nightstick.  The nightstick CRACKLES with blue
        electricity.  It's a combination Tazer/club.

                              KARYN
                  I beat the crap out of you and throw
                  you off the ship.

                              DUNBAR (O.S.)
                  Don't do anything we might both
                  regret.

        He steps up beside Karyn.

                              DUNBAR (CONT'D)
                       (to Nayram)
                  I ask your blessing, Sister.

        Nayram closes her eyes and bows her head.

                              NAYRAM
                  Freely given.

                              KARYN
                  What's going on?

                              DUNBAR
                       (to Nayram)
                  This is Officer Maine.
                       (to Karyn)
                  I'd like you to show our guests to
                  Cabins 1-C and 1-D.  Their gear has
                  already been brought aboard.  Issue
                  them with Level Three security access,
                  show them which areas of the ship
                  are accessible and which are out of
                  bounds.  All right?

        SNAP!  Karyn retracts her nightstick.  She gives Dunbar a
        frosty look, but doesn't argue with him.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               11.


                              KARYN
                  Sir yes sir.
                       (to Nayram)
                  If you'll follow me, please?

                              NAYRAM
                  Before we go, Officer Dunbar, I should
                  like to inspect the cells where the
                  prisoners will be kept.

                              DUNBAR
                  If you insist.

                              NAYRAM
                  I do insist.


        INT. EMPTY CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Inside a darkened cell.  The door opens, admitting a flood
        of light.  Nayram, Dunbar and Karyn peer inside.  The two
        Soul Brothers crane their necks to get a good look.

        The "cell" is more like a broom cupboard.  There's a single
        seat with a lid that doubles as a toilet, and a sink with a
        water tap set into the wall.  That's it.  The cell is barely
        large enough to allow a man to stand up, never mind stretch
        out and move around.

                              NAYRAM
                  They are all like this one?

                              DUNBAR
                  Pretty much.

                              NAYRAM
                  And how long will the voyage take?

                              DUNBAR
                  Thirty days or thereabouts.  We'll
                  be under constant acceleration.
                  Antimatter dust is introduced into
                  the booster mixing chamber, which
                  means--

                              NAYRAM
                  So you intend to keep your prisoners
                  locked up in these cramped, tiny
                  cells, for an entire month?

                              DUNBAR
                  We don't really have much choice.

                              NAYRAM
                  I assume you have your own cabins?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               12.


                              DUNBAR
                  Yes, we do.

                              NAYRAM
                  We shall vacate our cabins and occupy
                  these cells instead.  The prisoners
                  may use our cabins.  Will you also
                  surrender your cabins, as a gesture
                  of good will and love?

        Dunbar is lost for words.

                              KARYN
                  Yeah, sir, what about it?  You and
                  me can give our cabins up to the
                  prisoners, can't we?  It would be
                  the right thing to do.

                              NAYRAM
                  Your insincerity pains me.

                              KARYN
                  You'll just have to live with that.
                  Nobody's giving up their cabins.
                  The prisoners are all going into
                  these cells.  We'll allow them out
                  once per day, one at a time, to
                  stretch their legs.  At all other
                  times they will be kept under lock
                  and key.
                       (looks at Dunbar)
                  You okay with that?

        Dunbar nods.

                              NAYRAM
                  If you treat them like animals, and
                  expect them to behave like animals,
                  then that is what they will become.

                              KARYN
                  No offense, Sister, but I think they
                  already evolved.


        INT. PRISON WING - CORRIDOR - DAY

        Roberts and Chen carry out a routine headcount check.  We
        catch glimpses of the prisoners as the dynamic duo check the
        TV screens.

        GREENBERG'S CELL:  Greenberg gives them the finger.

        SORDELL'S CELL:  Sordell, stripped to the waist, does knuckle
        press-ups on the floor.

        VAN HOOLIK'S CELL:  Van Hoolik sits cross-legged on his bunk,
        in a yoga trance.  Peaceful.

        Roberts and Chen exit, their check completed.  All present
        and accounted for.


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik holds the Venusian maggot up before his eyes.  It
        twists and tries to get its teeth into his hand, but he holds
        it carefully between thumb and forefinger.  Marveling at its
        simplistic beauty, perhaps... its single-minded
        determination... its unconcealed ferocity.  Just like him.

        The maggot's mouths snap open and shut, desperately seeking
        something to chew to pieces.

        Van Hoolik's eyes swivel so he's looking at the door.  His
        lips curl into an evil smile.  Something's brewing in that
        crazy mind of his, but we don't know what.


        INT. CONTROL CABIN - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Dunbar and Karyn run through the pre-launch checks.  Karyn's
        mad as hell.

                              KARYN
                  When were you going to tell me?

                              DUNBAR
                  They arrived earlier than I thought
                  they would.

                              KARYN
                  They're Soul Brothers, dammit.

                              DUNBAR
                  Look, their Order has political clout
                  back on Earth.  With twenty-five
                  million voting members, you better
                  believe they got clout.  Whether you
                  like it or not, they're coming with
                  us.  It's not my idea.  Don't bite
                  my head off.

                              KARYN
                  What the hell was that "I ask your
                  blessing, Sister" all about?

                              DUNBAR
                  Doesn't hurt to be polite.  She's
                  their high priestess or something.
                              (MORE)

                              DUNBAR (CONT'D)
                  If we offend her in any way, we'll
                  both end up pulling night watch on
                  Mercury's dark side.  Is that what
                  you want?

                              KARYN
                  Big oops.  I was gonna whack her
                  with my zip-stick.

                              DUNBAR
                  I noticed.  You were ready to take
                  all three of them on, no hesitation.
                  Pretty ballsy.

                              KARYN
                  I guess "Stupidity" is my middle
                  name.

                              DUNBAR
                  I didn't say you were stupid.  And I
                  was going to tell you about them,
                  but like I said...

                              KARYN
                  They arrived earlier than you thought
                  they would.

                              DUNBAR
                  Yeah.  The woman is Nayram.  I dunno
                  if the guys even have names.  And I
                  don't know how this weird power of
                  theirs works.  What's it supposed to
                  be, telepathy?

                              KARYN
                  Empathic sharing.  What one feels,
                  the other feels.  If I thought they
                  could read minds, I'd be sending my
                  letter of resignation right now.  No
                  way I'd share a ship with telepaths.

                              DUNBAR
                  You got something to hide?

                              KARYN
                  Yeah, my lust for your body.  Wouldn't
                  want to give that secret away.

                              DUNBAR
                  Funny.  You've gone from wimp to
                  ballsy bitch in five short minutes.
                  Next thing you know, we'll be having
                  a pissing contest.

                              KARYN
                  Find me some snow and I'll write my
                  name.  Until then... just keep me
                  away from those Soul Brothers.  And
                  that bitch Soul Sister.  I swear,
                  those eyes of hers bored holes in my
                  head.


        INT. SORDELL'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Sordell paces up and down like a tiger in a cage.  He stops.
        Listens.  He's heard something... but what?


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S PRISON CELL - DAY

        Van Hoolik writhes on the floor of his cell, eyes wide, teeth
        bared.  He makes no sound, but it's obvious as hell that
        he's in pain... tons of pain... more pain than any sane man
        could stand.  There's no sign of the Venusian maggot...


        INT. LAUNCH BAY - DAY

        An umbilical is locked in place over the Moonship's external
        airlock hatch, like the boarding tunnel used on planes.


        INT. UMBILICAL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Exactly like an aircraft boarding tunnel.  Dunbar and Karyn
        meet Roberts at the open hatch.  Paperwork is checked.

                              DUNBAR
                  Has Van Hoolik been behaving himself?

                              ROBERTS
                  We didn't give him a chance not to.
                  He could be the least of your
                  problems.  Some real bad eggs coming
                  your way.  Van Hoolik got most
                  publicity because of the way he cut
                  up those hookers...

        He glances at Karyn.  She doesn't react.

                              ROBERTS (CONT'D)
                  ...But that's not to say the rest
                  are angels.  My top three would be
                  Whistler, Squid and Sordell.

                              DUNBAR
                  Why Sordell?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               16.


                              ROBERTS
                  He's got potential.  Served with
                  Special Forces, Aerospace Rangers.
                  Killed two goldshields with his bare
                  hands.  You don't want to get into a
                  fight with him.

                              DUNBAR
                  Who's Whistler?

                              ROBERTS
                  He did a number on his girlfriend
                  and the three guys he found with
                  her.  He just killed them, he didn't
                  chop them up and swap the body parts
                  around or anything.  That's Van
                  Hoolik's personal sicko trademark.
                  Problem is, Whistler's been boasting
                  he wants to improve his score.  Don't
                  turn your back on him, is all I'm
                  saying.

                              KARYN
                  And Squid?

                              ROBERTS
                  Strangled a female maintenance worker.
                  Turns out he did the same kind of
                  thing on Mars before he moved here.
                  Squid sees a woman, he goes crazy.
                  Some kind of hormone imbalance.
                  Either that or he's just nuts.  Take
                  your pick.

                              KARYN
                  Oh, that's great.  How did these
                  guys get through psych. evaluation?

                              ROBERTS
                  Are you kidding?  The Company's so
                  desperate for offplanet workers it
                  doesn't even run history checks any
                  more.  We got half the criminal
                  population of the Solar System hiding
                  out here.  The other half's on Mars.

                              DUNBAR
                  Well, these losers are heading for
                  the Moon now.  That's a one-way
                  ticket.

                              ROBERTS
                  Amen to that.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               17.


        They look down the umbilical corridor as we HEAR a noise
        like a steam train... a chug-chug-chug sound that gets louder
        as moments tick by.

        Chen leads the line of 13 PRISONERS along the umbilical.
        Their hands are secured behind their backs and they're wearing
        angle irons.  Their short steps make the chug-chug-chug sound.
        Two GUARDS bring up the rear, armed with zip-sticks.

        Chen stops.  The line of prisoners stops behind him.  Chen
        looks significantly at Roberts, who steps over so they can
        have a private conversation.  They keep their voices low so
        Dunbar and Karyn can't hear.

                              ROBERTS (CONT'D)
                  Any problems?

                              CHEN
                  Something's wrong with Van Hoolik.
                  He's bleeding at the ass.  Says he
                  doesn't need a medic.

        C.U.  Van Hoolik's ass, soaked with blood.

        Sordell, behind Van Hoolik, looks down at the stain.  Van
        Hoolik, sensing the attention, glances back over his shoulder
        at Sordell and gives him a "Mind your own damn business!"
        look.  Sordell just smiles.  Van Hoolik can bleed to death
        if he wants to.

        Roberts walks down the line of prisoners, pretending to give
        them all a last-moment inspection.  He just wants a look at
        Van Hoolik's ass.  He sees the blood.  Doesn't say anything.
        He moves to rejoin Dunbar and Karyn.  Smiles at them.

                              ROBERTS
                  They're all yours.


        INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Chaos, as the line of struggling, pushing prisoners is led
        aboard.  Some object to being consigned to the small cells.
        Dunbar doesn't give them a choice.  Karyn slams the doors
        shut as soon as they're inside and points her REMOTE CONTROL
        at each door.  The locks CLICK, sealing the doors.

        Van Hoolik doesn't object... neither does Sordell.  They
        step in without protest, next door to each other.

        Karyn finally has a chance to look at Sordell from close
        range.  Sordell stares back.  She shuts his door, locks it.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               18.


        WHISTLER, a big guy with a sour face, also climbs into his
        cell without protest -- but not before he exchanges looks
        with another prisoner, WILSON, further back in the queue.

        SQUID comes face to face with Karyn.  His face twists with
        hatred.  He hates women!  SNAP!  Karyn's nightstick extends
        and WHACKS Squid in the nuts!  We HEAR a BUZZ of voltage.
        Squid doubles over, his mouth open in a silent scream.

        Dunbar grabs Squid and throws him into his cell.  Karyn slams
        the door shut and locks it.  Perfect teamwork.

        Finally everyone's safely in their cells.  Dunbar nods his
        approval.  Then he sees Nayram and the two Soul Brothers
        standing at the end of the corridor, watching.

                              NAYRAM
                  Such barbaric cruelty earns its own
                  reward.

                              DUNBAR
                  Such barbaric cruelty is necessary,
                  Sister.  These are not nice people.
                  They're not even civilized.

                              NAYRAM
                  No matter what they did, they have
                  immortal souls.  It is our duty to
                  ensure that their soul-flames are
                  not extinguished before their time.
                  They will rejoin the Cycle when they
                  are summoned by the One, and not
                  until then.

                              DUNBAR
                  I don't think a month's solitary is
                  going to affect their soul-flames
                  one way or another.  In fact, it
                  might do them some good.  If they're
                  locked up, they can't be killing
                  anyone.

                              NAYRAM
                  You do not hear their cries of pain,
                  their pleas for help, as I do.

                              KARYN
                  Instead of worrying about their souls,
                  why don't you worry about the souls
                  of the people they murdered?

                              NAYRAM
                  I have already prayed for them.
                  They have rejoined the Cycle.
                              (MORE)

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               19.


                              NAYRAM (CONT'D)
                  Now I must pray for those souls that
                  may still be saved.

        Nayram exits.  The Soul Brothers follow her.

                              DUNBAR
                  Damn, she gives me the creeps.

                              KARYN
                  I think she likes you.

        Dunbar draws her a look.  He thumbs a code into his Remote
        and points it at the security cells.  Presses a button...


        INT. SORDELL'S CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Sordell grunts as his cuffs and leg irons SNAP open.  He
        rubs his wrists.  Feels much better.


        INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Dunbar unhooks a microphone from the wall control panel.

                              DUNBAR
                       (into microphone)
                  Good morning ladies and gentlemen,
                  my name is Officer Dunbar, and
                  together with Officer Maine I'd like
                  to welcome you all aboard Prison
                  Transport Service vessel <u></u>Far Horizon,
                  otherwise known as the Moonship, for
                  reasons that must be obvious by now.
                       (beat)
                  We will be departing Venus in just
                  over an hour.  Those of you with a
                  window seat will be able to appreciate
                  the beautiful view during take-off.
                       (beat)
                  Oh hell, I forgot.  None of you has
                  a window seat.  Damn.


        INT. SORDELL'S CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Sordell smiles.  He likes Dunbar's sense of humor.


        INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR - MOONSHIP - DAY

                              KARYN
                  Are you for real?

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               20.


                              DUNBAR
                  One of the perks of the job.

        He lifts the microphone and continues...


        INT. VAN HOOLIK'S CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Van Hoolik definitely isn't amused by Dunbar's crap.

                              DUNBAR (FILTERED)
                  Our voyage to the Moon will take
                  approximately 30 days.  During that
                  time we will be under constant
                  acceleration, which means you won't
                  be weightless.  At mid-point we will
                  turn the ship around, point our tail
                  at the Moon and begin deceleration.

        Van Hoolik is suddenly racked by AGONIZING PAIN that shoots
        up his body.  He twists and claws at the cell walls, eyes
        wide.  Blood erupts from his mouth, nostrils, ears... and
        from his butt, soaking his clothing.

                              DUNBAR (CONT'D)
                  Upon reaching the Moon, you will be
                  transferred to the Lunar Detention
                  Facility, where you will repay society
                  for your heinous crimes by serving
                  lengthy sentences in extremely
                  unpleasant conditions.

        We witness Van Hoolik's final unpleasant moments... and
        through the pain, unbelievably... he smiles in triumph!
        Then dies, collapsing like a rag doll.


        INT. NAYRAM'S CABIN - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Nayram GASPS in realization.  She faint and collapses onto
        the floor.  Kinda pretty, if not for the bald head and the
        scars...

        Her cabin door opens and two pairs of feet come to stand on
        either side of her.


        INT. GREENBERG'S CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Greenberg looks up at the overhead ventilation grill set
        into the ceiling of his cell.  Faint and inexplicable CHIRPING
        sounds come from the grill.  Greenberg frowns.  He doesn't
        know what the hell it is but he sure doesn't like it.

        INT. SORDELL'S CELL - MOONSHIP - DAY

        Sordell hears the same CHIRPING sounds.  He stares at the
        overhead vent in frank disbelief.
