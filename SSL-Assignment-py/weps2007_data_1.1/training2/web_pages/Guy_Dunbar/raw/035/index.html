<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Board of Supervisors informal meeting for July 13, 1999.  Review of the formal minutes for July 8 and formal minutes for the canvass of votes for special election for the special constitutional amendments and Board of Supervisors election on July 6.  Are there any comments or changes to those minutes?  If not, we’ll put those on for Thursday for final approval.</p>

</B><P></P>
<B><P>Stutsman: </B>Business from the County Engineer?  We have Mike Gardner with us and Al Miller, Assistant County Engineer.  Discussion/action needed regarding discussion/action needed setting public hearing for Road vacations 1-99, 2-99, and 3-99.</p>
<B><P>County Engineer Mike Gardner:</B> Good morning.  I was in a couple 3 weeks ago, and had received 2 requests for some Road vacations in the county, and at that time asked you to go ahead and authorize me to proceed with some research to get things ready so we could set a public hearing to do the Road vacations.  I have since done that research.  I also received a third request and thought we could go ahead and do it at the same time.  In a conversation with Carol Peters yesterday though, I found out that there may be a problem with that one so I want to research it a little further and we’ll only be doing 2 at the public hearing.  I’ve spoken with the Auditor’s office and it seems that it would work if the public hearing were held in your formal meeting on August 5th, if that works with your schedules.</p>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t work, so, we’ll just plan for 9:00 on August 5th, or any particular time?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> That’d be fine.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> OK, we’ll just do 9:00, and that’s for the 3 Road vacations…</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> There’ll only be 2, actually.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> There’ll only be 2.  Which one isn’t going to be on here?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> The one I received after the fact; it was a Road in Morse.  I thought there might be a little history there, so I’m checking with Carol.  She thought that there was too, and she was trying to find the stuff yesterday and wasn’t able to, so we’re going to research a little further and then we may have to take that one separately, later.  We will have to take it separately later.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> And where are these other 2, Mike?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> One is an alley in River Junction, and the other one is a small piece of Payne Road up off of 180th street, and Mehaffey Bridge Road, up in that area.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> We’ll have the public hearing then, 9:00 in the morning on August 5th.  Anything else?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> That’s all I’ve got.  I guess I would just like to point out that Prairie du Chien Road is progressing, and we’ve moved the date to when it’s going to be closed, and it will be closed on Thursday morning.  Starting Thursday morning, it will be closed at Newport, at the intersection of Newport Road.</p>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> I’m glad you brought that up under other, because I was going to, I don’t see Prairie du Chien Road on the agenda, and I’m sure it’ll be brought up here today, and there’s a lot of misinformation I think, on this Road.</P>
<B><P>Lehman: </B>You get some news releases out?</P>
<B><P>Gardner: </B>Yes, those were going out this morning.  We scrambled yesterday and contacted the DOT in Iowa City, because they’re involved with the detour that will have to be set up, and so we got that all cleared, and we’re sending out the news releases this morning, press release this morning.</P>
<B><P>Assistant County Engineer Al Miller: </B>We also put some signs up out there also, saying that we’re going to close it down Thursday morning?</p>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Well now that chairperson Jonathan Jordahl has arrived, I’ll turn the meeting back over to him.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> I ran into some Road construction believe it or not, unexpectedly.  My usual route here.  How long can we expect Prairie du Chien to be closed?</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>I’m guessing probably 3 months, depending on whether…  Actually, we had a slight change of plans; I can explain it a little bit to you.  We were hoping to get the intersection of Newport and Prairie du Chien Road completed before we shut the Road down, but we’ve got so many utility conflicts in there that arose after our original meetings, that we decided yesterday at our construction meeting to proceed and leave that until the end, so we don’t get delayed more than…  It was going to delay us 2, 3 weeks if we had to wait to get those utilities out of there.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> OK.  We have a…</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Can we move on, Jonathan?  There’s no other business.  The reason is, I have a meeting at 10:00, a JTPA meeting, and beings as I’m on the Board, I need to leave at 10.</p>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Oh at 10?</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Yes.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> What I was hoping to move on to was number 4…</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> That’s what I was going to suggest.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> …and that’s what I was going to suggest talking about here while you gentlemen were still here.  We have the people that want to talk about Newport Road, and that seems like it’s pertinent to the question of the design of the intersection at Newport Road, so I’d like to ask you to stay around for that if you hadn’t already planned to do so.</p>
<P></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="_Toc458578151">REPRESENTATIVES OF NEWPORT ROAD: PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS ALONG NEWPORT ROAD</A></P>
</B><P></P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> So on to item 4, we have, it says representatives of Newport Road; it doesn’t name who those representatives are, but I invite those who put this item on the agenda to come forward.</P>
<B><P>Lehman:</B> I think we’re going to have a spokesman or 2 that were going to summarize their interests and inputs.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> My name is Jim Glasgow, and I’m not a Newport Road resident; I live on Dubuque Street.  I’m going to list 5 points here that we’ve tried to bring everything down to these 5 points, and I’m going to be discussing really just one of them.  The pictures that I’m handing you are of Prairie du Chien Road.  The large one as you see…</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Now we’re talking about Newport or Prairie du Chien?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> This is Prairie du Chien.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Well, that’ll have to go under other.  And there’s no other.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> Since Prairie du Chien connects into Newport, we’re…</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Still, it’s not on the agenda, but I would say work it in under other; it’s just a technicality, just to stay legal.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow: </B>OK.  The 5 points here that we’re trying to discuss are…</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Well, I might say, Charlie does bring up a good point.  It is Newport Road.  This is on the advice of our County Attorney.  Newport Road is on the agenda, and we’re talking about Prairie du Chien.  It’s been published as Newport Road, and so people look at the agenda and say, they’re talking about Newport Road, and you’re talking about Prairie du Chien, so I think this is something that we need to get clarified.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Well, they can go under other though…</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> I would understand that what we’re talking about here might be rephrased as concerns regarding Newport Road, which have arisen because of the Prairie du Chien Road project, or something like that.  But I would like to ask you to direct your remarks to Newport Road, if you will.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> OK.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> But that really isn’t right either, because, like our County Engineer just met Prairie du Chien Road under other, and I think they can mention that under other, Jonathan, but…</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Well yes, no, I’m not saying they can’t talk about Prairie du Chien Road.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> …not under number 4.  They’d have to go on number 3.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> So number 3 in his 5 plans would be…</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Yes, number 3, because number 4 doesn’t have other on it, and it probably shouldn’t.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Yes, there is an other under 4.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Yes, that’s true too, under the County Engineer’s business, so the issue has been raised there.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow: </B>All right.  As far as Newport Road is concerned, we would like to take Newport Road off the 5 Year Plan that the County has.  That’s putting it very simply.  The concerns with Newport Road come because of the construction work and the upgrade to the Road, the Prairie du Chien Road project.  What most of the residents in the North Corridor area are trying to achieve is to maintain these Roads in their rural character, and that is stated in the North Corridor Development Plan, to preserve the scenic and rural character of the North Corridor.  And that I’m reading directly from your plan, and this was issued in December 1998.  Charlie Duffy, Jonathan Jordahl, and Sally were all on this, are listed as signing off on this plan.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Oh no, you got that wrong.  There’s one, there’s a negative vote, that’s mine.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Charlie voted against it.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> Oh, all right, OK, I’ll take that back.  Anyway, that plan was adopted, and what we are trying to do is preserve the rural character of the Roads out there.  There’s also an issue of Road construction in maintaining trees and limiting destruction of trees along the Roadway.  That’s actually a law, a State of Iowa law.  It’s 314.23, and I’m going to give you a copy of that law, too.  I don’t feel that that law is being followed in the Prairie du Chien Road construction project.  Now, I can’t really address an issue that is of immediate concern, because it’s regarding the Prairie du Chien project.  There’s some trees there along the Roadway, and that’s what I was just showing you in the pictures, that we would like to have some time to discuss whether or not these trees have to be removed as part of this project.  Can I move on to that, as far as under the other category?</p>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Mike was talking about the Prairie du Chien Road project, and it is clearly an item of public interest.  I’m just, I think that the sensitivity that Supervisor Stutsman is expressing here, and with which I have to concur, is that the agenda item says Newport Road.  It could as well have said, Prairie du Chien Road.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Yes, it should have said Prairie du Chien, and I’m not trying to be difficult, you know this is under the advice of the County Attorney, as far as the open meetings law.  Deana, maybe the best thing to do is just to call Pat White’s office and see if we’re OK to talk about Prairie du Chien, after he’s…</p>
<B><P>Glasgow: </B>Discussion from the public?  Can we move to Point 8?</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Well that will be the best…</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Yes, let’s get a sense of the Board to move, let’s move to 8 discussion from the public, people can bring this up and discuss it from the public.  We’ve got room in the agenda for the public to talk.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> OK, well great, that’s…  What’d I’d like to say as far as the…  I’m specifically concerned about an area that, when you leave the Interstate 80 bridge, on Prairie du Chien Road, and you come up to Linder Road; it’s about a one block area.  There’s approximately 60 or 70 trees in there, and that’s what you were seeing on the pictures.  What we’d like from the Board at this point is to direct the County Engineers to leave those trees along until they can be studied, and see if we can’t work out an agreement where those trees can be left.  They provide a visual barrier from the Interstate and they also provide a sound barrier.  The people living in Prairieview Estates, the
Streb property, and a lot of the properties on Linder Road will be affected by the destruction of that group of trees.  Now those are trees that are probably in the range of 40 foot tall.  These are not small trees.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> You said visual barrier to the Interstate; you’re talking about the ones right along the Interstate on the Southwest ?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> No, these border Prairie du Chien Road, between the Interstate Bridge and Linder Road.</p>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> And on the west side.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> This would be on the west side of the Road.  What I would like to have I guess, is to say, if you want a safe zone or a clearcut area, designate that maybe 20 foot back from the edge of the Road.  I don’t see any reason to wipe out clear back to the fence lines when we’re talking a Road with a speed limit, I assume, of 30 miles an hour in that area.  This is not anything that is going to cause accidents, or impair anybody’s vision, unless you want to look at the Interstate.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Al, I know that you designed the urban cross section there in order to try to take a minimum of right-of-way and preserve as many trees as possible.  What is the right-of-way requirement here, to west of the Road?</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>The right-of-way requirement?</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Or the clear zone requirement?</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>Government property, would be 10 foot from the (inaudible).</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> OK.</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>The reason why those trees are marked is for grading purposes.  Speaking with Mrs. Engel when we purchased right-of-way, actually we just got a little temporary easement from her, she indicated to me that those trees were all interior trees and she would just as soon get rid of those trees.  The reason why they were marked, obviously, is to grade a ditch through there, and I’ve already told our inspector to hold off on that, until we get down there to grade it to make sure we don’t take out any trees that aren’t necessary to be taken out, to grade a ditch through there.  There is actually going to be a ditch in that area.  It’s curb and gutter but there’s going to be a ditch because we can’t get the water to drain from that farm field down to our top of curve.  So we have to grade a little bit of a ditch in there, and that’s the reason for getting into that area with the trees.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Do you want to look at this?  You probably know all these trees by face.  I know how much you’ve worked on it.</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>I know the area he’s talking about.</P>
<B><P>Gardner: </B>They are tall trees.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> This is the issue right here, isn’t it?  It’d be the interstate bridge there.</p>
<B><P>Miller: </B>They are tall trees, but they aren’t that mature a tree.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow: </B>I agree, and I think what I’d like the board to say is if it’s possible, working with the County Engineers, to grade a ditch in there, say within the 20 or 25 foot right-of-way.  I went out there this morning and measured.  We can go 25 feet back, and not hit a tree, so I don’t see any reason that ditch can’t be maintained and still allow the trees to stay.  Now, as a developer, if I were to plant trees like that; you pay a lot for a visual and a sound barrier like that in any development, and here you’ve got it for free; I see no reason to destroy it.</p>
<B><P>Gardner: </B>How old would you say those trees are?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> The biggest one I measured was a 14 inch diameter.  And I would guess that they’re probably 15 years old, something like that.  They grow fast, so.</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>There’s a lot of the smaller trees in with them.  I’m not sure where the bigger ones are; if the bigger ones are back by the fence line, there’s definitely a lot better chance we can stay out of those.  I know a lot of them are 2 inch in diameter.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> There’s a variation of trees in there, but I counted at least 60 this morning that are at least 6 inch and above in diameter.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Did this issue of clearing the trees arise with Mrs. Engel by us approaching her and saying would you mind if we cut these trees, or by buying the right of way and discussing the trees and her saying, I would just as soon have them taken out.  Is it her preference, or does she just assent to it?</P>
<B><P>Miller: </B>When we talked about the property and we had marked the trees that needed to come out on Linder Road, and she brought up the point that there’s all the, I think they’re black locust trees growing in the ditch that were volunteer trees that she didn’t plant.  She’s more concerned about the bigger ones along Linder Road that are about 2, 3 foot off the Road on Linder, but basically her comment to me was she would just as soon have them taken off.  Obviously I don’t take out trees because people want them out.  We’ve gotten in trouble in the past about that, but that was entered into my thoughts on what we should do with the tree.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> This comes back to the other point to, is you are going down Linder Road and stripping out quite a few trees, back I would say 50 to 60 feet at least, major, I mean some fairly good-sized trees.  People like Dave and Mindy Streb are going to have just a wide open shot to the Interstate now, and at least these would give them some sort of a barrier from noise and visibility.  Plus, those of us that cycle out there would like to maintain as much of a tree canopy as possible.  These Roads are considered rural scenic Roads.  It’s not like other parts in the County; we have a lot of rolling hills out there and a lot of trees, and we’re trying to maintain that as much as possible.  To me this is just a first step of trying to work with the County in a way to adopt some type of a plan that allows for trees along these types of rural Roads.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> It seems like there’s some latitude here.  That’s what, when I met with folks about Prairie du Chien Road a couple of weeks ago, I encouraged them to look at, was where there was latitude between the standards that the Engineer needs to abide by for purposes of funding, of State requirements, engineering professional requirements and so forth, so if there’s some room between that and what is being done, then that’s where the discussion can take place.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> Exactly.  And that’s really what we’re asking for.  But at this point, and Al said they’re holding off on the trees; that’s really what we want, and we just like to know that, if they’re going to be destroyed we like to know ahead of time, and not have it just sort of happen, and then we’re all seeing a bare landscape there all of a sudden.  Like I say, when I went out there this morning and measured it, I know being in the construction business myself, I can put a ditch in there with no problem, and leave the trees there, but I think, working with Al and Mike we can probably work something out where at least the majority of those trees can stay.  Would also ask the County to consider re-planting trees along this Roadway, as also another part of this project.  We also have people that are willing to donate trees and money to re-plant the area.  With that, the only other thing I would ask, is can you take a vote on that today, now, just a general consensus of what direction?</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> No, this is the informal meeting where we can do a kind of a straw poll kind of a thing, but I think given that we’re addressing this question under discussion from the public, I’m not even sure that step would be appropriate, because this is more…  To the extent that I’ve engaged in discussion with you here, I probably have wandered too far into debate about the topic, and we should just be listening to you.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> It’s just that time is of the essence in this particular issue because we have a bulldozer at the front door there.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> You’re talking about this document?  Prairie du Chien Road, or what are we talking about here?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> This is actually point number one, which takes into effect the trees in the area.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> We’re on public discussion.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> I know, but…  It’s too bad this got under the…</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Let’s try and answer that question briefly.  Why is the item that is on the agenda Newport Road and not Prairie du Chien Road?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> Because we consider Prairie du Chien, Newport, Sugar Bottom, Mehaffey, all inter-connected.  Prairie du Chien Road is the first step to branching out to Newport and the rest of Prairie du Chien Road, Sugar Bottom Road, and actually the majority of the North Corridor.  It’s all an inter-connected issue.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> I think you’re dead wrong there too.  I don’t think Newport Road that will never be done.  And the problem is in this county that there wasn’t enough right-of-way taken at the start of these Roads.  Like some of our Roads are, and even Roads like Morse Road, IWV Road, F12, there’s no shoulders on them.  Because it’s only 120 feet and the other counties took 150 feet.  And this here, I’m really concerned, and I can do this under Report on the Prairie du Chien Road, there’s things here I certainly don’t agree with.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Charlie, I think Jonathan’s right.  This is under public discussion and we can’t make any comments about this.  All we can do is just listen to what people have to say.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Well, what we can do is write under public discussion, but I can’t under reports.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> But even then, you know, it’s just to give a report and no…</P>
<B><P>Lehman: </B>Well I apologize for the misrepresentation on the number 4 then, but I was approached…  The original purpose was to discuss the future of Newport Road.  It’s kind of expanded, but…</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> The people involved in this issue are from all over the place.  We’re not just Prairie du Chien Road people.</p>
<B><P>Lehman: </B>Once you sat down and started talking about, you realize you have other issues.</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> And I think I’ll let somebody else speak from…  Like I say, I’m Dubuque Street area, so, but there are quite a few people here from Newport Road, Prairie du Chien, and that area.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Well let’s just kind of divide it that way, that we’ll deal with the Newport Road question more in the realm of discussing policy and so forth, and when we get to Prairie du Chien you can express your concerns to us and perhaps direct questions to the County Engineer in an informational nature, OK?</P>
<B><P>Glasgow:</B> All right, OK.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Did you get anything back from the attorney?</P>
<B><P>Deputy Administrative Assistant Deana Pillard: </B>Since you’re under public discussion he says you’re OK.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> OK.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> We just can’t talk.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> We just can’t talk.</P>
<B><P>Pillard: </B>On Newport they can reference past county practices on secondary Roads but they can’t be specific projects.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>Hi there.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Hi.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Hi.</P>
<B><P>Laurie Tulchin: </B>I’m Laurie.  I live on Newport Road.  Lori Tulchin</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> You might want to, I don’t know if the Auditor’s office needs that spelled.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>T-u-l-c-h-i-n.  I just want to say it’s very disturbing that we’re not going to be able to talk about what we wanted to talk about based on a technicality, but I’ll go on from here.  I think the reason we’re all here is because we feel that Prairie du Chien Road is a foregone conclusion.  None of us were really notified adequately, and I know best friends of mine had land condemned and had like a couple weeks notice.  The reason we’ve called this Newport Road is that the folks on Newport, Mehaffey Bridge Road, Sugar Bottom Road don’t want to see the same things happen in their area that happened on Prairie du Chien Road.  None of us want to live in front of a highway and that’s kind of why we’re here.  We want…  The reason I’m here is specifically to have Newport Road, Mehaffey Bridge Road, and Sugar Bottom Road, well at least Newport, Mehaffey taken off the 5 Year Plan.  There was absolutely no justification to upgrade those Roads, increase the speed limits, take out the natural beauty, straighten them, take out the curves, that kind of thing.  The safety data from your website indicates that between 1990 and 1993 there were zero accidents, zero injuries, and zero fatalities on Newport Road, which is an astonishing safety record in my view.  I would say that I can speak for my neighbors; we’re just sick to our stomachs about what’s going on out there.  It’s basically going to ruin the way of life that we have all known for several decades.  I know I’ve lived out there since 1981 and there’s really no improving on the North Corridor as far as the Road situation.  The Prairie du Chien Road construction is just mass destruction, and it’s really not going to make life better for anybody in that area.  I think if you ask cyclists, nature lovers, people that are taking time to go out to the Res, they would prefer to take a back country Road out to the Reservoir and recreation areas than they would a superhighway that’s rated for 65 miles an hour.  Specifically that’s why I’m hear, and I’d like to kind of hold you guys to your Land Use Plan.  I don’t know whether Charlie agreed with it or not; there’s many things in it that I don’t agree with, but you guys said that you, there was, your objective was to preserve the scenic rural and natural character of the North Corridor with minimal new or additional services, so we find that you guys aren’t living up to what you laid out in the Land Use Plan as far as the North Corridor goes.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> You know it’s funny we haven’t talked about safety, and this Prairie du Chien Road comes up all the time.  How come that’s not…  I do get a lot of calls, and I got one yesterday, about the Newport Road as it comes off Prairie du Chien Road.  School bus drivers hitting those trees, and especially when there’s ice on them.  Farmers that almost got knocked off of their tractors.  But again, as far as I’m concerned, that stretch of Newport Road is a dead horse to nowhere for me, because there should have been more acquisition, and we have had a problem all throughout this county, like if you want to go turn off Morse Road sometime, follow it into Cedar County you’ll see what I mean.  Sugar Bottom Road was mentioned; that’s not even on the 5 Year Plan is it, Mike?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> No, not at this point.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Not at this point.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> It’s kind of in the tail end of the thing though, as a study area.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> You see we feel that it takes, we have to be at least 5 years ahead of you guys, because…  It’s not too early, I live on the corner of Newport and Highway 1 and I’m fighting with the DOT; they’re trying to put a frontage Road in my yard to access my south neighbor, as they eliminate access to Highway 1.  So although everybody tells me it’s 18 months to 2 years to 3 years down the Road, we are specifically here to ask you to take Newport Road off the 5 Year Plan.  Take Mehaffey Bridge Road off the 5 Year Plan.  These are beautiful, scenic blacktop Roads.  If you guys want to do some re-surfacing, or you have too much money, or whatever it is, we’ll take some re-surfacing, but there is absolutely no reason to straighten these Roads, even your guy Dunbar who you had up here from the State, we kind of crashed a meeting that Jonathan and Mike were having the other night.  He said Iowa is way behind the rest of the nation in coming up with new and creative ways to slow down traffic and make the Roads safer.  We got the buzzword traffic calming, where many people are, many engineers are designing Roads with curves and trees, to keep people from driving as fast, because the trees have a calming effect.  I find that we’re just doing cookie-cutter Road construction here based on the rules and the criteria.  I know that everybody feels real safe with a list of criteria because then they don’t really have to think.  If they’re following the criteria and they’re doing what the engineers say then they’ve got to be right.  But I don’t think we’re putting the engineers to task enough to come up with new and creative ways to develop safe Roads that are also fun to be on, not only in a car, but on a bicycle or walking or hiking or whatever.  And the North Corridor is unique in Johnson County that there is some elevation, and there’s some trees and some curves.  It’s very, very beautiful out there, and the safety data is on our side.  There are no accidents, there is no safety problem.  There’s never even been a posted speed limit.  There’s not a dangerous curves sign, there’s not a slow down sign.  We haven’t tried to approach this potential safety issue with anything but ripping out Roads and straightening them, and doing what you did in Sutliff.  The Sutliff Road is a superhighway in the middle of nowhere, going to Lisbon…</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> I don’t agree with that either.  That’s a connector Road.  It should have been in there at least 5 years ago.  That’s why the Feds put a new bridge on Sutliff, to go around and bypass Solon…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> OK, but you do understand that Newport Road is just a 4 mile, basically a 4 mile driveway.  It is the way these residents get home.  It doesn’t take you anywhere, it’s not a major Road to anywhere.  And Sugar Bottom Road isn’t either.  It’s just a winding Road through residences.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> I can answer your questions, as you’re under public, again, see this funding was approved.  It was asked for through what we call the ISTEA program.  That’s where the tax dollars, this is a big deal, for a 6 county area, and it’s not set in stone.  All we did is see was feasible, like Newport Road, and Sugar Bottom Road wasn’t even considered.  Mehaffey Bridge Road, did you mention that?</p>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>Yes I did.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Then you’re wrong on that.  I don’t agree with that.  Because, as you come from North Liberty, up top the hill here’s Sugar Bottom Road.  You’ll see that that is an approved highway Road, and from there on out to Solon it isn’t.  And I think that, and we have an approved Road like that, you have it marked, and that gets top priority.  But as you head over into Solon, there along that Road I don’t think you’re going to see too much competition because that is a concrete highway plus a 6 foot paved shoulder, for the farmers, you know, can…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> But what I’m saying is I think people need to open their minds to new ways to improve Roads.  All we see is taking out hills, taking out any elevation, clear-cutting trees because supposedly some drunk is going to wrap his car around it.  There’s other ways to improve Roads and keep them safe and still keep them beautiful and we are not seeing that coming out of Secondary Roads at all.  I don’t want to keep repeating myself.  I am here based on your safety data.  I am asking you to take Newport Road and Mehaffey Bridge Road off of the 5 Year Plan and to agree never to put
Sugar Bottom Road on the 5 Year Plan.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Let me respond to Newport Road.  You know I sat there and participated in a long conversation about this a couple of weeks ago and coming out of that meeting, as relatively intense as the meeting was there does emerge for me some kind of different way of configuring what the future of those Roads might look like.  What we are aiming at is a policy that will correlate what we do with the need of the area.  One of the things that I discussed on that day was the ongoing development of the area which is something that is in many respects a forgone conclusion.  There are many platted lots that are not yet built on.  Those can simply proceed.  So there is going to be an ongoing increase in traffic on Roads in the North Corridor.  We have to address that question somehow.  One of the things that strikes me as a room for creativity here is that you are talking about traffic calming would be to talk about a policy of developing this area which will develop as a relatively dense residential area more along the model of a residential area than a rural area.  Since that is sort of what it is becoming.</p>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>We were all prepared to hear you say that.  Nobody wants you to talk about suburban Roads and that kind of thing.  This is a country Road, this a rural Road.  We don’t need any labels put on it.  And nobody is concerned at this point about the increase in development or the platted lots or anything like that.  Dean Oaks he won in court but he has not taken out a building permit.  You cannot see into the future, you don’t know how fast things are going to be developed or who is going to start subdivisions or what.  At this point with as many residents as you claim are out there already, we have no accidents.  That is the fact.  The fact there is not a safety issue here what so ever.  Another fact is that many states are employing traffic calming effects to slow people down.  And you don’t see any proposals there.  The fact that Newport Road has some curves in it and some hills does not inherently make it unsafe.  It is not an unsafe Road now and
Sugar Bottom Road is not an unsafe Road.  So you can keep telling us about all of these platted lots and all that but it is just not an issue at this point.  And it could very well not be an issue 5 years down the Road.  And if it becomes an issue, if we go from 0 accidents to 1 accident which is a 100% increase.  I mean we can certainly look at least posting a speed limit.  There are so many more cheaper and more creative ways to take care of this potential safety issue that is not here yet.</p>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> I think that you are kind of merging 2 struggles into one.  We’ve got the one thing immediately that Newport Road is currently in the 5 Year Plan…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>That is right.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> And that issue could be addressed by taking it out of the 5 Year Plan.  The other question that I am trying to point at is that there could be a discussion, a process, a planning document emerge that looked at where the room for creativity is between engineering standards and the pattern of development that has already been approved in the North Corridor.</p>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> We would like to revisit the North Corridor Plan because there is many things in it that number one nobody is living up to and number 2 that we don’t like.  But in the immediate future yes we all feel and intense need to get Newport Road and Mehaffey Road off of the 5 Year Plan.  An intense need, intense.  I don’t think you understand how we all feel out there.</P>
<B><P>Lehman: </B>I think it is January or February that budget time is when we sit down and revisit our 5 Year Plan and we budget funds for the following year, but I think that you are correct in assuming that it is a plan, I mean stuff connects.  I know that you are going to be effected even by Highway 1.  If something happens there it will take a lot of pressure off of Newport.  Maybe we won’t have to do anything with Newport where the
Sugar Bottom majority of the traffic goes there now.  I think talking about accidents, reported accidents.  I know that there is a lot of people that slide off into the ditch and it does not get reported and thank goodness nobody has been hurt and that time.  I think that people need, we talked about trees early.  You know trees grow every year and people have to realize that when we try to trim trees back we may have to take 10 years worth of growth back.  When you see it every day you don’t realize how much for visibility and that type of thing.  I think your, I appreciate your efforts for coming today.  You are kind of planting the seed but I think as far as action, our 5 Year Plan is usually January and February of making allowances and plotting our course.</p>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>Well OK what is it going to take.  We don’t know the political process.  We will be camped out here between now and January, I guarantee it.</P>
<B><P>Lehman:</B> Well I think the other thing is like you mention about alternative traffic calming and stuff.  I think that Mike and Al would welcome any information that you can gleam for them.  I mean they only know what they… They are a couple of progressive type guys.  I mean if you can give them some information.  They don’t mind being the leaders in the industry.  I mean if you can lead them to the water they are willing to take a sip.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> I mean when you think about Breckenridge and Vail.  It is millions of times the traffic that our little hills and valleys see.  They are not clear cutting the Roads going up mountains.</P>
<B><P>Lehman:</B> We are a progressive community, I think that they are willing to look at it.  They don’t have anything carved in stone as far as design.  I don’t think that there are any limitations.</P>
<B><P>Mary Ellen Hill:</B> I’ll make the coffee.</P>
<B><P>Lehman:</B> Yes, well I think that they are willing to look at alternatives.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>OK but I am not leaving here until I know how to get Newport Road off of the 5 Year Plan.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Right, Newport Road is certainly being discussed right now.  It is on the agenda.  I want to say something about that that came up in our looking at the 5 Year Plan.  When people from Prairie du Chien Road were talking about Prairie du
Chien Road’s presence on the 5 Year Plan and its immediate future as well.  And that is that some of those folks took the step of getting the preliminary traffic counts from the department of transportation for the 1998 count for roads in that area.  And where the plan as we discussed it originally in the 5 Year Plan pointed at building an arterial system going from highway 1 down Newport to Prairie du Chien to Iowa City.  It appears that the traffic flow.  The increased traffic on Prairie du Chien that we see in the last 4 years is not coming from Newport.  It is coming from East Overlook Road primarily.  It tosses a different kind of a color over what the future of Newport Road should be since it does not seem to be a thoroughfare that is accounting for the increase in traffic.  So to me there is an argument right there for taking it out of the plan.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>OK, I’ll give you a big kiss for that.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> This is progress.</p>
<B><P>Tulchin: </B>Yes I was ready to strangle you.  OK the only thing that I keep hearing is that the increase in traffic dictates this immediate necessity to widen roads, paint lines, and increase their speeds.  It does not.  And I really think that it is going to take a lot of us sitting here over and over again to kind of hammering that into people that wider roads and faster roads don’t make safer roads.  I mean we can maintain the safety with the roads that we have if we look at some other ways…  You know no matter what happens out there I don’t think that the increase in traffic is dictating what Secondary Roads is flopping on your desk every year saying these are the projects that we are going to do.  I mean these guys build big roads.  And we just don’t need them everywhere.</p>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> Let me hasten to leap to the defense of the County Engineer and the Assistant County Engineer on what they present to us.  I think that there is probably merit to your notion that they are designing things according to the standards that they are accustomed to working with, but that is why we hired them is to do that.  The Board of Supervisors though does exist as a way of setting County policy.  So there is room for the public to come in and say hello we want things done differently.  Well then we have to then balance here is what the public is saying it wants and here is what the engineers want and I’m saying great let’s put the 2 together.  Let’s talk about it.  So that’s, I think there are 2 stages in the thing here.  There is looking at the Newport Road question that you have got on the agenda today.  I don’t think we necessarily would have to wait until January to decide that we don’t want to do Newport Road in the near future.  But I am not confident about that because we have bought plan with the DOT that just went in recently.  Mike can you clarify that?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> It is submitted to the DOT by April 15th each year.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> So I mean could we take action to modify that now or would we have to wait until January and resubmit the plan April as a new document.</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> It can be done any time.  I would not recommend that you do that at this point.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> And why not?</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> We are not going to start construction on it right now so I guess that I don’t see any problems waiting until we do the update of the current plan as part of our regular process.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> You are going to have the same Board in January barring any unforeseen incidents…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> OK do we need to come back and remind you about how intensely passionate we are.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> Oh sure, a public hearing with a five year plan, that is done every single year.  You know we discuss the 5 Year Plan and we have a public hearing and it’s great that we are the process and that you will be a part of that public hearing.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> And I guess that I would like to make a request that all of you go out there.  I don’t know when the last time I know you are out there but…</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> All the time.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> I know you are.  But I would like you all to go out there and at least, I get the feeling that you don’t really know what we are talking about.</P>
<B><P>Stutsman:</B> I was just out there.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> I have a request of you.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Yes.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> I would like you to go and look at the West Overlook Road.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Absolutely.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> I ride my bike on the West Overlook across the dam and off Prairie du Chien.  And I can tell you that when you are riding on Prairie du Chien and up a hill and a gravel truck goes by that is scary.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> And that is because how fast is he going?</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Well I have no idea, I am trying to preserve my life.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> There has never been speed limits posted.  There is no enforcement.</P>
<B><P>Mary Ellen Hill:</B> There is now, there is now.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> It really doesn’t make any difference if you get run over a gravel truck going too fast or not or following the speed limit, you are still in trouble.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Well have you ridden on Newport road and Sugar Bottom
Road?</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Yes I ride out there a lot.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> And would you like to see them straightened and flattened and all the trees taken down?</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Well that was my point.  I don’t think that West Overlook was straightened and flattened.  It is still a pretty road.</p>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Well what do you think.  How do you guys vision your version of the Newport road, flattened and straightened?</P>
<B><P>Miller:</B> That was one comment that I wanted to make.  I don’t know how it is going to lay out at all.  I don’t have any survey information back.  My suggestion would be wouldn’t be nice to know what the impacts are going to be before we…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> No I don’t think that anybody on Newport road even wants to get that far.  We have heard comments like…</P>
<B><P>Miller:</B> I don’t know what it is going to look like then because I don’t know.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> How about anybody on an inside curve is going to lose their property.</P>
<B><P>Miller:</B> How do you know that. I don’t know what the curves are out there…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Newport road doesn’t…</P>
<B><P>Mary Ellen Hill: </B>That has been indicated Allen.</P>
<B><P>Miller:</B> I don’t know what the degree of any curves are.  I know the ones on 180th street I am happy, we aren’t going to have to change hardly at all.  The layout…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> What is the justification for spending any money on Newport road?</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> It is not going to happen, I’ll tell you that right now.  5 Year Plans don’t mean that much.  But when there are dollars to pay for it.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Well there you go.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Well unless you want to pay for it yourself.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> No way.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> Well you might if you are annexed into the city.  It’s the gas tax.</P>
<B><P>Jordahl:</B> It is my money it is everybody’s money.</P>
<B><P>Duffy:</B> What is messed up years ago there wasn’t enough right-of-way but we have to keep the roads cleared of…</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> But I still want an answer from Secondary Roads.  What is the justification for spending any money, doing anything to Newport Road.  It is based on what?  How can you convince these guys that Newport Road needs anything?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> We were trying to get an arterial road that would carry the traffic that was going to be generated out there in the North Corridor area.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> OK and you feel that Newport road as it is doesn’t do that?</P>
<B><P>Gardner:</B> It does but it is not designed to carry the kind of traffic that is coming.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> So that is why we have no accidents on it?  Because it is just not designed…</P>
<B><P>Miller:</B> The rates you are using is a 3 year period from 1990 to 1993 reported accidents to the DOT.</P>
<B><P>Tulchin:</B> Right and so if reported accidents are all skewed then all of these reported accidents are off by the amount that don’t get reported and Newport Road is overwhelmingly safer and accident free compared to everything else.  You cannot justify doing anything out there.  I mean, even if the traffic doubled you don’t know what would happen to the injury rate and accident rate.</P>
<B><P>Thompson:</B> Well every year we make the 5 Year Plan based on the information that we have at that time.  The information changes you bring us something that traffic count comes in on that, we can make a different decision.</P>
