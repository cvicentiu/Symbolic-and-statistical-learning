<br>AB: This annotated bibliography is intended as a general background guide for volunteer librarians in churches and synagogues. It is assumed that the user has little knowledge of contemporary literature for youth in grades 7 through 12, but is aware that their reading needs are not identical to those of younger children or adults. Rather than listing books that are explicitly devout, the guide lists books that emphasize values that all religions hold in common. Criteria used in selection include proven popularity, the presence of values beyond self, and availability in paperback. The works of four contemporary authors who write for young adults - Lois McMaster Bujold, Madeleine L'Engle, Cynthia Voigt, and Walter Wangerin, Jr. - are profiled. The bibliography is divided into the following sections: (1) biblical fiction (Old Testament times, and at the time of Jesus and of the early church), 22 titles; (2) contemporary fiction, 31 titles; (3) fantasy and science fiction, 10 titles; (4) historical fiction, 14 titles; (5) short story collections fiction, 4 titles; and (6) non-fiction, 37 titles. Author and title indexes are provided. (SLD)

<br>AB: While English teachers want students to enjoy reading, to appreciate the beauty of literature, and to recognize the universality of the classics, many adolescent students do not become interested in the aesthetic aspect of literature until they are beyond high school age. Some works, outside the traditional literary canon, speak more directly to adolescent readers' interests and needs, provide a way of engaging students' interest and, because they are well written, offer a source for the development of reading and discussion skills. Such books include Cynthia Voight's "On Fortune's Wheel," Mildred Taylor's "Roll of Thunder," and Sue Ellen Bridgers' "Home before Dark." (A chart detailing Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development, an evaluation form for young adult literature, and a list of 13 resources for children's and young adults' literature are attached.)

<br>AB: Books that remind children and adolescents that writing is fun and that they can be writers not only confirm the reading/writing connection, but also demonstrate that reading can be a springboard to writing. Writing and receiving letters is very exciting to beginning readers, and there are many picture books that provide examples of how to write a letter, what to include, and how a person can organize his/her thoughts. "The Jolly Postman, Or, Other People's Letters" by Janet and Allan Ahlberg, "Frog and Toad Are Friends" by Arnold Lobel, and "Letter to Amy" by Ezra Jack Keats, for example, illustrate some of the purposes of writing with which young children are familiar: to express thanks and appreciation, to issue an invitation, and to express the writer's feelings. Bruce Brooks' "The Moves Make the Man" shows two adolescent boys advocating writing as a worthwhile activity, not something to be confined to school assignments. In this story, the reader is told what "equipment" is needed for writing, and that writing is an effective vehicle for sorting out thoughts, and for telling a story. Other stories such as "Dicey's Song" by Cynthia Voight and "Dear Mr. Henshaw" by Beverly Cleary illustrate that getting a response is another prime reason for writing. And Lois Lowry's "Rabble Starkey" teaches students how to improve their own writing by using a thesaurus. These and other books are good models for reminding students that writing is fun. (PRA)

<br>DE: Religious-Factors; Secondary-Education; Values- 
<br>AB: A survey of books for young people reveals that some of the best (and even award-winning) novels deal with the controversial issue of religion. Although most of these books deal with religion only in the background, some clearly present this issue in the forefront. One book, Cynthia Rylant's "A Fine White Dust" (1986), traces a religious quest. In this story the reader sees a young man, at the end of the seventh grade, making a revival which will change his life. The pattern is a rather common one - when religion is portrayed as a sincere faith or relationship with God, it is usually seen as a positive benefit. When churches or religious leaders are portrayed, their image is often negative, as seen in "Is That You, Miss Blue?" by M. E. Kerr. Organized religion as experienced in a religious school is a sham compared to the true religious experience of the heroine. "Beyond the Chocolate War" (1985) by Robert Cormier and "Tree by Leaf" (1988) by Cynthia Voight are representative of novels that depict the suffering of religious people in their quest for personal meaning. These and other books show the hunger for God and the search for spiritual meaning in life present in young people today, and, as such, are worthy of study. (A list of 10 religious books for adolescents is attached.) (KEH)

<br>AB: This study utilizes content analysis to compare and contrast the female protagonists in award-winning contemporary adolescent fiction. R. J. Havighurst's developmental tasks are discussed in reference to diverse female protagonists from approved school reading lists in Montgomery County, Maryland. Sara, from "Summer of the Swans" (Byars, 1970) and Dicey from "Dicey's Song" (Voight, 1982) are analyzed in attempt or achievement of these tasks. The study concludes that there is a lack of strong, positive female protagonists in adolescent literature. Because of the impact of reading on adolescents, teachers should incorporate more novels featuring strong female role models for reading by both males and females. (Three tables of data are included, and 17 refernces are attached.) (Author)

<br>DE: *Adolescent-Literature; *English-Curriculum; *Literature-Appreciation; *Reading-Material-Selection 
<br>DE: Elementary-Secondary-Education; English-Instruction; Instructional-Materials; Student-Attitudes 
<br>AB: Three young adult novels published in 1983 or 1984 that are worthy of a place in the literature curriculum are discussed. These books have a special appeal to adolescents, deal with problems students might encounter growing up, expand their self-awareness and their experiences, and are teachable. They contain balanced, recognizable, and discernible themes, a challenging but not formidable vocabulary, and literary devices for discussion such as symbol, paradox, point of view, and style. The first book is "The Sign of Beaver," by Elizabeth George Speare, the story of a young boy's survival alone and his relationship with the Indians in eighteenth century Maine. The second is "The Callender Papers," by Cynthia Voigt. This is a mystery suspense story about a young girl who is employed to sort through the Callender family papers and who discovers a suspicious death, a kidnapping, and an altered will. The final book is Robert Cormier's "The Bumblebee Flies Anyway," about a boy in an experimental hospital ward for terminally ill boys. While a fine book, it may pose problems for the public, and teachers will likely have to point out to students that the patients are in the facility willingly. However, dealing with the story's paradoxes and symbols will be a rewarding and uplifting challenge. (HTH)
