Throughout the entire book you will fine yourself cheering for the protagonist, Dicey, and her younger siblings (James, Maybeth, and Sammy) as they struggle to seek a suitable home after their mentally ill mother abandons them. Homecoming sets the standards for books young adults read because of its entertaining taste of "the real world". This exciting story is filled with fun and I highly recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the plot, characters, and conflicts found in the novel Homecoming. <BR>The plot of Homecoming was very unique and heartbreaking. The story started off in Provincetown, Massachusetts where Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy Tillerman's mom abandoned them in a shopping mall parking lot. Due to current financial difficulties the family was heading to Bridge Port, Massachusetts to live their wealthy Aunt Cilla. With no mother and little money left the children decided to continue their trip to Bridge Port hoping to be reunited with their mother. The children set off by foot on the open road. Traveling miles a day the youngsters were soon overtaken with fatigue. They spent a few days resting in a state park/campsite where they met Louis and Edie who were teenage runaways in love. When their energy level was back to its peak the family continued on to Bridge Port. One rainy night the children stopped in a local park to spend the night. Windy, a man who attended the nearby college, noticed them and helped them out by feeding them and giving them a place to sleep. The next morning Stewart, Windy's roommate, drove the Tillermans the rest of the way to Bridge Port, where they stayed with their cousin Eunice. Eunice was a devout Christian and felt it was her duty to take these children in. The 50-year-old woman was not very happy with herself for doing so, however. It was not that the children were so terrible; it was more that Eunice was a crabby lady who had become accustomed to her way of life. When thoughts of putting the children into separate foster homes came into the cousin's head the children quickly made like a banana and split. They headed for the town of Crisfield, which was where their grandmother lived. <BR>Cynthia Voigt did a superb job developing the characters of Homecoming. Each one had their own distinctive qualities that added to the joy of reading this novel. For instance, there was Dicey, the leader and the oldest of the Tillerman children. She was loving and caring of her younger siblings and sure always made sure they had money, food and appropriate shelter for he night. Dicey always stuck up for her family and would argue to protect them. Then there was James. James was the second oldest of the four-some. He was highly intelligent and loved school and reading. Although James could be disobedient at times, for the most part he followed Dicey's orders. Next we have Maybeth, the third oldest. Maybeth was shy and quiet. Many people would mistake her for being retarded. She was always polite and obedient. The last and youngest of the Tillerman's clan was Sammy who is best described as a little rascal, Sammy was stubborn and quick to disobey Dicey, although he didn't always do it to be mean or difficult. Another important character is "Gram", the Tillerman's mother's crazy mother. Gram was very similar to Dicey, not willing to lose an argument. She was loving, but also had an extremely rough outer shell. <BR>The conflicts in Homecoming are what gave this novel its pizzazz. Dicey had an internal conflict with herself over where and how her family would sleep and eat each day of their journey. She also had a conflict with cousin Eunice. The two girls didn't get along well together. Dicey had so much personality and Eunice was a very plain person. After the idea of foster homes came about there was no way Dicey would allow her family to remain at this residence any longer. Another conflict was between Dicey and her grandmother. Dicey was told her family could not stay at Ab Tillerman's house but somehow she managed each day to argue one more night's stay for herself and her family.<BR>Homecoming had dazzling character development, a brilliant plot, and many out of the ordinary conflicts for the Tillermans to overcome. I recommend this book for many reason, two of them being that the book was believable, yet it took you away from your everyday life. The book also kept your attention and was impossible to put down. You couldn't stop reading it because you had to make sure hat the Tillermans were okay and that they made it to their next location safely. I immensely enjoyed reading the novel Homecoming.</p><h3><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'> What I Think About Homecoming</h3><p>I think homecoming is a good book. It is about four kids named dicey, Maybeth,James, and Sammy. Every cristmas their aunt cilla sends them a card, so they diced to go see her. When they where on thier way to Birgport thier mother wento the mall and told them tostay in the car while she go in.Then seh told James Maybeth and Sammy to obay Dicey and do what she says to do. They watied a long time and she never came back. So Dicey said lets start walking to Brigeport and maybe mom will be thier. days and days went by and they finly made it to thier Aunt cilla house. When they got thier they found out that thier Aunt cilla was dead and thiercousin unice stayed thier, also that thier mother was not thier. So days later they got tired of staying thier so thye decied to go see thier grandmother. They found out that thier grandmother was mean until they got tokonw her. But they now live with thier Grandmother.</p><h3><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'><img src='images/star.gif' alt = '4.0 Stars'> Homecoming</h3><p>Homecoming is a good book!! this book shows what would really happens to young childern on there own!! it also shows that you should love your family and love people you never met and they can help you!! the book shows things may not turn out like you want it to but it comes out ok!! cuz even if you are alone there are still people out there in the world that can help you!! these childern go a long way and go through alot just to find a loved one and still try to stay together!! you should really read this book!! when i first looked at it i said we have to read ALL this!! but i'm glad i read it!!
