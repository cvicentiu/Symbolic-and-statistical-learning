<B>Battle of the Books</B>
</DIV>


<BLOCKQUOTE> 

<P>The purpose of the Battle of the Books program is to encourage reading by all students at the middle school level. Students, regardless 
of ability, are exposed to quality literature representing a variety of literary styles and viewpoints by prominent authors in the area of 
young adult literature.  The game format creates interest and excitement in reading.  Through the fun and excitement of the competition, 
students improve reading skills, mature in their choices of reading materials, and acquire a broader knowledge base.  Even during the height 
of the competition, students and coaches should remember that the goal is to READ, not necessarily to win!</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="kidsgraphics/bob.gif" HEIGHT="75" WIDTH="500" Alt="Battle of the Books 2004-2005"></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>History</B></P>

<P>North Carolina's Battle of the Books can be traced back to a public radio program in Chicago in the 1940s originated by Ruth Harshaw.  
Librarians exposed to the original show reconstructed the game to encourage reading today.</P>

<P>Michael Leonard, an Illinois native, first introduced the contest in Onslow County when he accepted the position of Children's Librarian 
for the Onslow County Public Library.  His rationale for placing it at the sixth grade level was the dearth of activities in the public 
library and in the public schools for this aged child.  In 1981, Onslow County Public Library sponsored the first North Carolina Battle of 
the Books contest for sixth graders.</P>

<P>The North Carolina Association of School Librarians assumed sponsorship of Battle of the Books in 1991.  In 2000, the North Carolina 
School Library Media Association became a co-sponsor of Battle of the Books, and independent schools became a region for competition.  
The first state competition of Battle of the Books was held in 2001-2002.  NCSLMA/NCLA provides certificates for system level and 
regional/cluster battles and also coordination of the program on a statewide basis.</P>

<P><FONT ALIGN="left" SIZE=+1>In celebration of <A HREF="http://www.cbcbooks.org/html/book_week.html">National 
Children’s Book Week</A> the Youth & Children's Services Department sponsors the

3,000 Stanly County students submitted an entry.</P>

they may choose to center their artwork around another theme as long as it is about books, libraries or reading!</P>

<P>There are three winners and ten honorable mentions chosen by a panel of judges each year in three age categories: K-2, 3-4, & 5-6. 
The nine winning designs will become the library's official bookmarks for the coming year. Entry blanks may be picked up at participating 
school media centers or at any Stanly County Public Library in the month prior to Children's Book Week.</font></P>

<H3>History of Quiz Bowl</H3>
The Public Library Quiz Bowl began in 1980. It is a program of academic competition among teams 
of North Carolina high school students. 2002 is the 19th year that Stanly County has participated. 

<H4>Would you like to help out with Quiz Bowl?</H4>
We need a few good volunteers. Requirements? It depends on the job. If you're interested, give 
Ruth Cotton, the local coordinator, a call at the main library: 704 986-3758.
</CENTER>
<H4>How to Prepare for Quiz Bowl Competition</H4>
1. Know the rules. Read the manual--ask your coach or Ms. Cotton for the manual nearest you.<BR>
2. Keep up with current events. Read the newspapers. Don't ignore local, regional or state 
happenings. Scan the weekly news magazines. A few of our favorite news websites: www.cnn.com, 
www.moreover.com, www.usatoday.com, www.msnbc.com.<BR>
3. Memorize <I>The World Book Encyclopedia</I>. Just kidding. But! There are several good, 
concise, general reference tools out there, to bone up on the basics. Here's just a few: 
<I>The World Almanac</I>, <I>Information Please</I>, <I>The New York Public Library Desk 
Reference</I>, <I>Everything You Need to Know About World History Homework</I>.<BR>
4. Stay awake in class. Do your homework. Not kidding. Learn something in school that might be
useful later? Hey, stranger things have been known to happen...

Mary Anne Marx, a member of the SCPL Kids! staff, has owned many different type of birds and other critters.  She and her son Seth have performed for numerous
groups throughout the county and have entertained hundreds of kids and adults alike for our own Summer Reading Program.  In deserved recognition, Mary Anne, 
Seth, Admiral, Cupid, and all the rest were named as an Outstanding Children's Program by the North Carolina Public Library Director's Association.

It's free...kinda sorta...(your tax dollars at work)...
<p>
The North Carolina State Library provides much of the materials for this program: 
reading records, stickers, bookmarks, and ideas for special activities.

<p>
<a href="info.html#friends">The Friends of the Stanly County Public Library</a> also gives 
their generous financial support for special prizes and professional storytellers. 
By late March or early April, schedules will be available at all Stanly County Public Library locations.

It's easy!
<p>
The Summer Reading Program is not only a great way to keep track of the library books you read 
(or have read to you) during the summer, you can also enjoy many special programs at every Stanly County Public Library location. Registration is required 
only for reading records and the prizes, not the special events.
<p>
There are no age restrictions for the Children's Summer Reading Program, but we do ask that you 
register for only one of our Summer reading records: either the Children's or Adult<i>
(There are age restrictions for the Adult SRP)</i>.

<HR>
<p>
<a name="signup"><font color="006633" size=+2>
<img src="kidsgraphics/star.gif" align="left" width="60" height="50"><b><i>Where can I sign up?</i></b></font></a><br>
When the program starts, you can sign up at any Stanly County Library. You will receive a schedule 
of events, and a reading record to keep track of what books you read. Please list only the 
library books you've read since school's been out. We also ask that you read books at or above 
your reading level. This is a great opportunity to read books <b>YOU</b> like. If you need help 
finding books you like, check out our <a href="kid_services.html#kidlit">reading lists</a>, or ask your 
local librarian for suggestions!
<p>
Easy books (call # E) are worth 1 point each. All other books are worth 3 points. Prizes will be
awarded, depending on how many books you've read (or have read to you). 
<p>
Bring your reading record with you every time you visit the library, and we'll check the titles off your list. Keep your list in a safe place between library 
visits. We'll have some extra reading records, but we may run out if lots of people need 
replacements.
