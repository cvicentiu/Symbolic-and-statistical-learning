As for publishing, I'm pretty sure that once you put something up on the internet, it can't be published. You can ask Raewyn to take your work off WW if you want it published, though.<br />

<blockquote><font color=SandyBrown>I'd email a publishing company you were interested in and ask them.  I'm not sure if Raewyn or people at WW will know.  Ultimately, it would be up to the publishing company you submit to. I believe I emailed PublishAmerica about it once. I believe they said if you took it off the website, it would be ok.<br />

<br />
Ah hah! Another excuse for a book list!<br />
<br />
About a Boy by Nick Hornby (just like the movie)<br />
Enemy Women by Paulette Jiles (very romantic Civil War drama)<br />
On Fortune's Wheel by Cynthia Voigt (also very romantic)<br />
Time Enough For Drums by Ann Rinaldi (remains one of my fav books of all time)<br />
Timeline by Michael Crichton (very scientific, read at your own risk)<br />
The Long Patrol by Brian Jacques (or any book in the Redwall series)<br />
Blind Beauty by K.M. Peyton (similar to the Seabiscuit story)<br />
Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine (way, way better than the movie)<br />
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister by Gregory Maguire<br />

<blockquote><font color=MediumSlateBlue>if you're talking about things being published on WW, I think the publishers would publish it. Proboards sites and other free forums that you've published writing on probably would too. they better! *threatens publishers with th Wallace sword, which is taller than her*<br />
<br />
Um (I start most of my sentances with that word) Some good books that I like are:<br />
<br />
Any of the Redwall series (Marlfox is one of the best, Long Patrol and Taggerung are pretty good too) by Brian Jacques<br />
Mars Diaries by sigmund Brouwer (10 book series about a project on Mars. One of those into-the-future sci-fi books.)<br />
Lightning on Ice, same authour. (hockey series)<br />
LOTR trilogy (if you don't know who wrote that, condemn yourself now.)<br />
Slapshots by Gordon Korman (humourous 4-book hockey series)<br />
Dive, and Island trilogies by GK (there's also Everest, but I don't recommend that one.)<br />
Wally McDoogle and Bloodhounds, Inc. by Bill Myers (humourous. christian fiction.)<br />
Blood Ties by Sigmund Brouwer (this is like a thriller, written for adults, but if your one of the people who likes reading about a guy stalking a woman for 20 years, try this. Best read alone in a basement, by flashlight, in the dead of night.)<br />
Guardians of Ga'Hoole by Kathryn Lasky (fantasy thing about owls... lol)<br />
I also heard that Inkheart and Woman with a Sword were good, but Ive never read them. That's all I have time for now. *goes off muttering her hate of clothing stores*<br />

<blockquote><font color=red>Well if you like fantasy and Lord ofd the Rings then I guess you would like The Silmalarion. I just finished reading it and was very interesting. I would also recomend Hero Song. As well as its sequal Fire Arrow. They were really good books as well.<br />
<br />
Now let the song begin! Let us sing together<br />

<b>melanie101, aged 12 says:</b><br>
<blockquote><font color=lightpink>I would reccomend reading;<br />

<b>Superwriter, aged 12 says:</b><br>
<blockquote><font color=MediumBlue>Yes, it means that publishers won't accept it, because they have no idea of knowing that you're the person who wrote that piece of writing under your screen name. They have every right to suspect that you're someone who's claiming to be the original author when you're not. So if you want to submit something to the Internet that you want to get published, you might not want to do it after all.<br />
<br />
I would recommend anything by J.K. Rowling, Philip Pullman, Brian Jacques, and Cynthia Voigt. Those are my absolute favorite authors.<br />
<br />
<font size=1><font color=blue>I'm gonna get by and just do my time, <br />
