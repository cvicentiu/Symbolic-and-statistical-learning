                        <b> The Old Man And The Sea</b><br>
                        <i>By Ernest Hemingway</i><br>
                         <br>
                        The book is about a poor fisherman who is going through some tough times in his life. The fisherman lives in a shack by the ocean and only eats what he has caught. But unfortunately he is in a slump and has not caught anything in two weeks but will not give up for his bravery and friends who fail to let him. A big tournament approaches and the boy ( the old man's friend ) demands that he enter for the winner gets 5 thousand dollars (which the old man desperately needs) and the old man does not want to embarrass himself but he would try to end this slump so he goes for it. Two days later he travels to the docks to get his boat ready for take off. When he arrived the other fisherman made fun of him and laughed as they usually do but that did not brake his concentration. Unlike the other boats his was a small wooden paddle boat kind of like a canoe. Finally he was ready to set sail he untied his boat and head for sea. He looked around for a great spot for a big fish but couldn't make up his mind for one looked very good but he chose the one that gave him a little feeling in his stomach. Hours past without a single fish in sight but he was determined not to give up for he wanted this more than any other fisherman here. So he stayed there longer. The time went by and night was coming he felt that if he went home to sleep he would mis something great so he got out a rag and used it as a blanket. The next morning he was awakened by the sounds of dolphins not the kind that talk and do flips but the kind you eat. By then the old man was very hungry and got out his spear to see if he could catch one if it comes up. The next thing you know thousands of them rush up as the old man realized it was a school of dolphins he took his spear and killed as many as possible. When the fish saw this they all scattered. But not before the old man could get five. For now his hunger issue has ended but he still needs a fish to take home. Well time passed and nothing happened he just waited and waited but still no fish in sight.  So he thought about his life and everything back home to kill time. Then out of no where a giant tug nearly pulled him off the boat. His fishing pole was different from all the others it was just a rope that he tied bait to. He pulled but nothing happened so he decided to wait and get the fish tired. Days past and the fish just kept pulling harder and harder. He didn't know what to do. The fish however was taking control he swam under the boat and tried to flip it but failed. When the old man saw this he gasped and.................  I hate spoiling books so you can read it and find out. The old man and the sea is a classic tale with excitement, drama, and a little bit of comedy.

                        <b> On Fortunes Wheel</b><br>
                        <i>By Cynthia Voigt</i><br>
                         <br>
                        This prachtig (superb, to those of you who don't know German) novel is expressed charmingly throughout the twists and turns of fortune and fate, of romance and adventure.  Cynthia Voigt uses detail in the right quantities, in the right places.  A very dramatic piece, it has it's cooling off points and multiple climaxes.  Writing is an art. Some pieces demand to be kept sharp and jagged. Others shout to be blended and smoothly flowing.  Most however require a bit of both.  You know, a dash of vivid blue and a mellow garden.  Voigt has remarkable taste and did her home work on this time period's culture.  Her painting is one that will stay in your mind forever. It not a typical fairy tale, but does have the element at a first glance.  Birle is a poor innkeepers daughter that gets tossed by fate into Orien's hands.  Orien is a lord; she notices that right away by his clean-shaven face.  She does not know his name, yet, or his rank which she finds out on a rock prison after being washed out to sea from the river.  Orien is to be Earl, maybe is already, for he does not know the fate of his grand father.  The pair are found by a ship after eight days of starvation, and put into slavery by their rescuers.  At the slave market, Birle is bought, by the king's brother, along with Yul, another slave on the ship.  Orien is sold to a carpenter.  Joaquim is the name of the old man that bought Birle and Yul.  He is very afraid of his brother and with good reason too for Corbel is a mean king and his people fear him.  After a year or so, Corbel holds a feast where she sees Orien for the first time since he was sold.  They talk and she finds that he is sold to the mines.  No one ever comes out of the mines.  A few days later Birle finds a feverish Orien outside of the philosopher's house.  The philosopher himself is thinking of fleeing the city because he fears his brother so.  Birle thinks this a great plan to escape along with Yul and Orien.  Once a safe distance outside the city gates, Birle stopped the cart, retrieved the unconscious Orien, and walked off the road on to a path leading north through the woods, leaving the stuttering old man behind.  After a few days and nights, they came upon Damal's camp.  To be technically correct, they were actually grabbed roughly when they could hardly see the light.  Well to get on with it Damal, after taking there chains off, let them go, all accept Yul, who he kept in exchange for the weak mule he gave Birle to carry Orien.  The lady made a camp in the woods, which would serve as a home for three fourths of a year until they made their journey back to the Kingdom in the fall.  I cannot bear to tell you any more of this enchanting story. I think that every young adult/ kid should read this book because it is a mix of everything. I like the fact that it is not a prince-charming fairy tale and it is not a Stephen King novel.  It is a great, philosophical story of a couple destined to be together no matter what happens.  All my friends love it and I think you would too.

                         <br>
                        Joel and his friend Tony are going  to the park and Joel dares Tony to go swmming in the river but there's one problem-Tony can't swim. But Joel does not know he doesn't know how to swim all he knows is that he's really bad at it. So they're swimming in the river and all of a sudden Joel can't hear Tony anymore; he gets to the other side and Tony was gone. Joel kept on looking but he runs out of energy fast so he quits looking and he starts walking away from the river.  Then this teenager and his girlfriend started yelling at Joel for being in the middle of the road. They stop and ask what was wrong but Joel couldn't talk, he kept on pointing to the river. If you read this book you will find out what's going to happen to Joel and his friend Tony.

                        <i>By Marion Dane Bauer</i><br>
                         <br>
                        "On your honor?"Joel's father said. "You wont go anywhere except the park?" "On my honor," Joel repeated. The story is about a boy named Joel. He's about 5'4,he's blonde and he's white. I think Joel is stupid,because he and is friend both went swimming in the Vermillion River when they were warned never to go. In fact he promised his father he would only go to the park. The problem in the story is that Joel dares his best friend Tony to a swimming race in the Vermillion River. They were warned never to go there,but Tony didn't want to let Joel think that he was scared. So they both jumped in. When Joel reached the sand bar he turned and looks for Joel ,but he didn't see him. Joel did not not want anyone to know so he went home and locked himself in his bedroom. No one knows what happened to Tony. The story takes place in a town near the Vermillion River. I think the theme of the story is if something bad happens get help. A reason for that is because in the story he could not find his friend so he got scared and went home. Another reason is that he didn't know what to do when he did not see his friend. The book On My Honor won a Newberry Honor Award. Joel lied to his father when his father trusted Joel on his honor. I would recommend this book to kids the age 9-12 because the reading level is around their ageanother reason is that kids these ages do stupid things that can lead to serious situations. I liked the book, because the characters in the story seemed real and the events can happen in real life. Another reason why I Iiked the book is because I have friends who mean a lot to me. It also taught me to be honest during serious situations.

                         <br>
                        One of the best books I have ever read is On the Banks of Plum Creek. If you dream ofpioneer days like I do you will enjoythis bookbecause it is entertaining and heart warming. Though it is very femanine but  boys would probubly like it to. It will also give you some cool but unusal facts about life in the 1800's.
Here is the family story for you. It starts out when they are moving from Minnesota to a man named Mr. Hanson's farm.The Ingalls familygot the house by trading their two grand horses. Then pa sees the wheatfield and he knows he'll get good pay for it. But then for some mysterious reason grasshoppers come and destroy all the wheat which ounce was so big and plentiful. Finally it turns to winter and all the grasshoppers are gone and it is peaceful now.

                        <i>By Matt Christopher</i><br>
                         <br>
                        On the Court With Michael Jordan is a biography of Michael Jordan's life. The book begins when Michael is a young boy and continues until his last year of pro basketball.

There are two messages in this book.  The first message is if you try hard you earn what you want.  Michael Jordan was not very good in basketball but he tried very hard.  For instance, his high school basketball coach did not pick him to be on the team, but he tried very hard and practiced a lot and he proved to the coach that he could be the best player on earth.  The second message is to show people what a great athlete Michael Jordan is.

It is great that some people (like his high school basketball coach) did not think MJ was any good at basketball and then he became the greatest player ever.  I enjoyed the book a lot.  I learned a lot about Michael Jordan.

                        <i>By Carl Deuker</i><br>
                         <br>
                        My book is called "On the Devil's Court" by Carl Deuker.  This book is about a boy named Joe who loves to play basketball and really wants to play for Loyal High, but he can't because his are parents making him go to a private school. Joe got brought home by the cops because his friends had a party and the neighbors called the cops on them.  He only knew about one or two people at the private school, and he didn't even really like the person at first but they became friends.  He made the basketball team there, and soon he became really popular.  He was the star on the court.  He could make ten slam dunks in a row, 15-footers, and score about 30 points every game. Joe thinks that the reason he can play so well is because he "sold his soul to the Devil."  The conflicts with his father actually made him a stronger person and not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. I really liked this book because the author had actual basketball games and wrote them in so much detail.  It made it really fun to read.  There were many high points in the book, and they made it really exciting.  Everything about this book is just all around great. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who loves basketball.  If you don't like sports, you may not like this book very well but there is another story behind it that  is quite interesting.  This book could be read by any age group but young adults and teens would enjoy this book the best.  Even girls will like it.  I'm a girl, and I absolutely loved this book!

                         <br>
                        On the Far Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George, the Newbery Award winning author. This book is an adventure in the Catskill Mountains. Jean Craighead George does an exceptional job portraying Sam Gribley's love for nature and capturing nature itself. In the first book in this series, My Side of the Mountain the main character, Sam Gribley ran away from his New York City home one year ago to live in the Catskill Mountains. Sam's sister Alice came to the Catskills to live with him too. The two of them met a couple that lived in a nearby town their names were, Bando and Zella. The author, Jean Craighead George does an exceptional job revealing Sam and Alice's love for nature. Jean Craighead George is a fine writer, she adds much dialogue to enhance character relation and understanding. Her concepts rarely become complicated and rich with ideas and thoughts. On the Far Side of the Mountain falls under the genre of an adventure story. This book rates a definite 9 out of 10. This is an adventure about a sister and brother who find each other throughout good and bad times.

                         <br>
                        Jared can't wait to get to get to his cottage to see his grandma.  When he gets there, he decides to take a traditional bike ride.  When Jared is going down a hill, his brakes fail and he crashes into a toxic swamp.  The next day he goes to his grandma's house. His whole family is there.  When Jared talks to them, he picks up words like he is reading their mind.  Jared finds out that he is reading minds.  What will he do with his new talent?
Others See Us is a good book to read if you are into science fiction and a little romance.  It is action-packed because there are a lot of fights between the other mind readers.  I really thought Others See Us was one of my favorite books.  I really liked how Jared could read the minds of other characters and see what they were thinking.  I also liked how Jared had courage and stood up for what was good.

                        This is a very good book that takes place in the 1899 on the Nasel River in Washington State. What happens in this book is, the main character, May Ameila is 12 years old and lives in a family with all boys.  She has 1 birthday wish to make.  That wish is that her mom has a girl.  Her mom is having a baby.  Her mom has a baby, but I am not going to tell you what it is.  Until, something heartbreaking happens. You have to read the book to find out.
