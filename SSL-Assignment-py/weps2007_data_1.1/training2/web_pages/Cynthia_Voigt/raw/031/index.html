I read _Tree by Leaf_ about 5 or 6 years ago and I remember it being kind of a strange subject for her to write about.  Another one I read of her's that Ididn't like was _the Callendar Papers_. It has the same genre as _tree_ and I didn't like either of them, but that's all I can remember about them, that I didn't like them.  Sorry, I'm not much of a help, but I had to add my two cents.
