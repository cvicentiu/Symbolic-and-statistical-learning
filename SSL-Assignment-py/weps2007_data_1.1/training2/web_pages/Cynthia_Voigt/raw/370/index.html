   If there is any thing i forgot feel free to add.<br><br>&gt;&gt;By clums_e<br><br><hr><br>Cynthia Voigt writes really good books. I've never in a life time wanted to keep reading the book "Homecoming" which is about these kids who get abandoned by their mom. They had been going on a trip to see their aunt Ciela and they all fell asleep on the way over there. Anyways they woke up to where their mom was gone and they didnt know where to go. You have to read this book!!! Anyways Cynthia thanks for making such good books that i could actually sit down and read without wanting to stop reading it.<br>
<br>
Hope everybody reads this,<br><br>&gt;&gt;By MissPerfectionous<br><br><hr><br>KIss my ass<br><br>&gt;&gt;By bitch<br><br><hr><br>Cynthia voigt is a great author. I loved her her book HOMECOMING. My seventh grade teacher gave my classmates and I HOMECOMING.At first, I thought that it was going to be another boring book but when I started reafing it I couldn't put it down.It only took me about two or three weeks to read it. Just because the book is thick and has like 300 pages it doesn't mean that it is a boring book. Trust me, once you start reading HOMECOMING or any other books from Cynthia Voigt, you will not be able to put the book down. I have just started reading the sequel to HOMECOMING, DICEY'S SONG. All I have read from the book is that dicey keeps on cleaning the whole house, not that it is a bad thing, but since her mother had left her and her siblings and died, she had to do everything: find a place to sleep, find food, and risk getting caught by the authorities, who will put them in orphanages and seaperate them(that was in HOMECOMING and there is much more in the book, it is a very interesting book). So if you think this book is very interesting, I think you should get it. Now, HOMECOMING is not the only book that Cynthia Voigt has written, so you should do the same thing I'm doing, and read all of Cynthia Voigt's novels!<br><br>&gt;&gt;By HATIJE<br><br><hr><br>Cynthia voigt is a great author.

I can't remember if I read "Jackaroo" or "A Solitary Blue" , but they are awesome books!  She is a wonderful writer, and I would be most pleased if I could write to her and tell her how much I enjoy her work.  I would also be excited if she wrote more on Dicey and/or Jeff!!
