Exciting, adventurous, and a page-turner; those are probably the best three ways to describe <u>Homecoming</u>, a novel by Cynthia Voigt.  That is because it has a wonderfully written plot.  Abandoned by both their mother and father, Dicey must lead her family in search of a home.  There were just three main things that stood in their way.  First, they didn't have a lot of money.  Second, they had no way of transportation.  Lastly, at thirteen, Dicey was the oldest.  She had to figure out how to get James, Maybeth, Sammy, and herself across a long journey in one piece.<p>Reading this story makes you feel like the fifth member of the group.  It takes you in and makes you feel like you are really with the characters.  I think that that is the best quality of the book.  It's what makes you want to keep reading.<p>I could really relate to Dicey since I am the same age as her.  She had a lot of responsibilities, as do I.  In all of the situations she was faced with, she did what I would have done too.  I could understand how she was feeling when she came across different struggles, and that helped me get into the book.<p>My absolute favorite part was the end.  Of course, I'm not going to tell you the ending, for that would ruin how great you feel when you read it.  So, instead, I'll just say that I thought it wrapped up the whole book, and was so surprising.  Cynthia Voigt did a wonderful job on this novel.  Girls would probably like it more than guys, because it's from a girl's point of view.  But, I think anyone who enjoys adventure and a good read would love <u>Homecoming</u>.
