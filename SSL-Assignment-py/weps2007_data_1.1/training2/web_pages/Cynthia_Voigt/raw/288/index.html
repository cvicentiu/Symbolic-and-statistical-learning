<strong>Customer Rating:</strong> 5<br /><strong>Summary:</strong> Dicey's Song<br /><strong>Comment:</strong> Dicey's song was a wonderful novel that I enjoyed and loved. The book was mainly about Dicey Tillerman and her three siblings, her grandmother, starting a new life together and how hard letting go can be. As the book went on thirteen year-old Dicey made new friends and got caught up in new relationships and matured into a young lady. Last summer (in book one, Homecoming) Dicey and her family were traveling up to Bridgeport to their aunt Cilia's house. On the way stopping at a mall Dicey and her siblings were abandoned by their mother. From there, they began a long harrowing journey to find their aunt and what happened to their mother. When they arrived, they were surprised in many different ways, and had many questions about their present, past and future.<BR>There were many gripping events that made this book enjoyable and easy to read. I like this book because it was moving and it kept you thinking. An example is when Maybeth was having trouble in school, especially with her reading. James (the smart one) decided to be the hero and helped Maybeth. I thought to myself "Will James succeed in teaching Maybeth how to read?" and he did! That was stimulating. I liked that part because it had me engrossed into the book. Another example is when Dicey and her family received letters from the Boston Hospital about their mom. I thought in my head, "Oh my gosh, what is it, bad news or good news?" I was really worried. Also, when Dicey went to Home Economics class I always was thinking, "What is her teacher going to be annoyed about today?" Her teacher always seemed to be irritated with her. It was really funny and surprising. There were many other unforgettable events in this book that I will remember. <BR>Of all the novels that I have read I picked this one because it had a great plot with many interesting details. It had a great moral too. I think that all these qualities were what make this an outstanding book to read. I liked this book better then the Homecoming because I thought the first one was sad and a little dramatic, but I liked that one as well. I enjoyed it because I thought it showed what life would be like for you if something as sad and devastating happened to you. The other novels were just the same but did not get me thinking as much. Right now this is my all time favorite book.<BR>I recommend this book to young teenagers that love adventures and survival stories. I say this because Dicey's Song is a book that pulls you into the book as if you were traveling along with the Tillermans. It is exciting, touching, and overall outstanding! I loved Dicey's Song and if you read it I am sure you will too.<br /><br /><strong>Customer Rating:</strong> 4<br /><strong>Summary:</strong> Great read for struggling teens<br /><strong>Comment:</strong> Dicey's Song by Cynthia Voigt was a great book for teens that are struggling with growing up and letting go of past events. Probably girls would like it more because it tends to be sentimental at times. It is easy to become sympathetic for Dicey after learning about her hard childhood in which she was mostly responsible for her younger siblings. However, this book was not written to gain pity for Dicey. This book was written to show how terrible pasts can become triumphant futures. <BR>  Dicey had a really hard time adjusting to her new surroundings after her mother was put in rehab and was sent to live on her grandmother's farm. She had to let her grandmother take charge, and let someone else do the worrying for her. She had to learn to accept her new role in the family, all while trying to figure out just exactly who Dicey Tillerman was. Every teen goes through having to adapt to new things, whether it be physical changes, social changes, or emotional changes. Dicey struggled with all of these things. She just wanted to be a little girl again, because she realized that her childhood years had been spent being "mom". 'I don't want to grow up!', was Dicey's internal cry. She finally realized that she had to accept her new life. When she learned to let go and give control to someone else, in this case, her grandmother, a huge weight was lifted from her and she was much happier. It seems to me that most teens are quite stubborn and tend to hold onto one thing, when in fact that one thing is holding us back from living life to the fullest. <BR>This book was a great read, and pretty deep for teen fiction. I was overall really impressed with Voigt's language and voice that really came out in this piece. Anyone who likes to read about identity struggles would like this book. However, if you need a really complex plot to float your boat, this one isn't for you.<br /><br /><strong>Customer Rating:</strong> 5<br /><strong>Summary:</strong> deceptively simple masterpiece<br /><strong>Comment:</strong> The thing I most love about Cynthia Voigt's writing in general, and the Tillerman series in particular, is her understanding of what makes people tick. This is especially evident in this novel, which deservedly won the Newbery Medal. Much of the interest of the story centres around Dicey's development, growth and change, and her attempts to understand people and the relationships between them.<P>Cynthia Voigt is also unusual among YA writers in her consistent development of the adult characters as complex and real; evading the trap of making them simply foils for the teen protagonist or a catalyst in the story.<P>A book that can stand on its own as well as part of a series, and one that will be treasured by those who love thoughtful stories about real people.<br /><br />
