TUESDAY 31ST AUGUST 2004<BR>Apologies to anyone who is waiting for a book from me (ring/trade/relay, etc) - the last couple of weeks have been hectic & I've not had chance to get to the Post Office let alone do any reading!  Things are due to calm down in the next week or two, so please bear with me, and I will get all books owed despatched as soon as possible.  Sorry for delays!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I think Book Crossing is a fantastic idea!  I have always loved reading and it's great to have a global reading group to share thoughts and opinions.  I love being able to share the books I love with other people, and maybe find more appreciative homes for those books I didn't love so much!  PM me if interested in a trade from my 'available' bookshelf (sorry, no RABCKs at the moment).  I will continue to do wild releases, but mostly prefer to trade, and will also be releasing some books into bookrays and bookrings.<BR><BR><STRONG> WILD RELEASES - CAUGHT!

If you're in the UK, visit www.greenmetropolis.com and stock up on books to cross - hardbacks and paperbacks are ALL just £3.75 each (standard paperbacks post-free!)!  Not only will you find some fantastic bargains, but for every book bought from this site, a donation is made to the Woodland Trust's Plant-A-Tree scheme.  How cool is that?!  You can make a difference with just one book AND have something good to read and cross!<BR><BR><STRONG> Tuesday 20th January 2004 </STRONG> <BR>Have updated all books on my bookshelf with current status.  Please PM me if you are interested in a trade for something in my 'Available' or 'TBR' files.
