I have read a few of Cynthia Voigt's other books and this book proved to be another unique story by her. This book focuses in on the Halls, who have moved to Maine because of their Dad's job. Their mother is on the West coast because of a job as well. Their father, Samuel Hall, is thrilled to receive a unique egyptian collection which includes a mummy. The mummy is stolen, but soon that is the least of their porblems. Trouble soon begins to arise. This book is truely a great book brought to a satisfying end.<br /><br /><div id="starbottom"><div id ="startop" style="width:42 px;"></div></div><b>An "OK" book</b><br />I read "The Vandemark Mummy" after reading "Izzy, Willy-Nilly," because I enjoyed Cynthia Voigt's writing. This book is just a fun book to read if you have nothing else to read or do. "The Vandemark Mummy," is a young book with a kiddy plot, so don't expect anything major.<br /><br /><div id="starbottom"><div id ="startop" style="width:70 px;"></div></div><b>Terrific book!</b><br />...The Vandemark Mummy was filled with action, mystery, and suspense, making this work of fiction a great summer book. Phineas and Althea&#8217;s father is offered a job at a college in Maine. He accepts, and Phineas and Althea have a tough time getting used to the state, the town, and the new people. The college at which their father now works has a collection of Egyptian artifacts, including a mummy. Someone attempts to steal it, shocking everybody. Then it happens again; this time, however, the robbers are successful. Can Phineas and Althea solve the crime, or will the mummy remain permanently off display?<br /><br /></td></tr></table>
