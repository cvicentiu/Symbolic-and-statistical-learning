<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Anne
Frank: Beyond the Diary</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'> by Ruud Van Der Rol</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
book is about Anne Frank's life before she went into hiding, and more
background information on the things written in her diary. There are many
pictures of her, her family, and of the 'Secret Annex.' I thought the pictures
in this book were great, and also all the things that Anne Frank didn't mention
in her diary. I would recommend this book to people who want to learn more
about Anne Frank and the Holocaust.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Anne
Frank - the Diary of a Young Girl</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'> by Anne Frank</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
I thought this book was very boring and uninteresting, many people would
disagree with me. I must admit that it is the best account of the Holocaust and
the horrors the Jews had to live through. Millions of other people just like
Anne Frank were deported to concentration camps and killed. I would recommend
this mainly to teenage girls and adults, because of the things Anne writes
about.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
Bookstore Mouse</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;color:black'> by Peggy Christian</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cervantes
is a mouse who lives in a bookstore behind the books in the reference section.
It is there that he hides from Milo, the bookstore cat. Until one day, when
Cervantes falls on the floor far away from his home in the reference section
and nearby where Milo is on the prowl.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading has always helped him, and when he
stumbles upon a very old book, he stops to look at it. &quot;Far away, and long
ago...&quot; is how the book - and Cervantes' adventure - starts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is a funny, unique adventure through
strange and unusual words. I like this book because in it Cervantes learns to
conquer his fears, and face life with a sense of adventure. Fans of
&quot;Redwall&quot; will definitely enjoy this book.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
Boxes</span></u></strong><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Arial;color:black'>by William Sleator</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
book was about a girl named Annie, whose Uncle Marco gives her two boxes to
look after when he goes on one of his many, strange trips. She was told not to
open them, but she does. A strange creature crawls out and goes into their
basement. Annie must decide whether or not to open the other box. This book was
strange and interesting. I would recommend this to people who like science
fiction books.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Ella
Enchanted</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'> by Gail Carson</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ella
was given a fairy &quot;gift&quot; at birth. It was more like a curse to her.
The foolish fairy, Lucinda, had given her obedience. She had to do whatever she
was ordered to do - whether it was giving away her mother's necklace or cutting
off her own head! Despite this curse, she manages to live a fairly happy life
with her mother and Mandy, the cook. Until one day, her mother falls gravely
ill and dies. Then Ella's father, a merchant, returns home and decides to send
her away to a boarding school. At the school there are two girls who find out
about her curse and set to treating her like a servant. It is then that Ella
decides she must find a way to break the curse - once and for all. I liked this
book because it was a wonderful retelling of the classic Cinderella story, and
had the most surprising plot twist at the end. It makes you wonder if Ella will
ever live &quot;happily ever after&quot; up to the last chapter of the boo. I
would recommend this book to any classic fairy tale lover.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan
has blue eyes. Because of this, he is afraid he will be insane when he grows
up. His friends tease him and call him &quot;loony-blue&quot;. His father is
obsessed with finding the legendary firegold apples and doesn't speak to
Jonathan much. The only one who ever seemed to care about him was his mother.
One day while he was fishing, he saw a girl. A barbarian Dalriada girl with
blue eyes. Jonathan wondered if she was afraid of becoming insane, like him.
But when she saw him, he ran. As the year went on, things start happening faster
than Jonathan could keep up with. Then tragedy strikes and Jonathan has to make
his decision to go to the Red Mountains or stay in the Valley. I liked this
book because it was suspenseful and had good story action. I would recommend it
to any horse-lover and teens from thirteen to fifteen.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
Folk Keeper</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corinna
was abandoned by her father on the steps of an orphanage by her father as a
baby, and grew up slaving and serving for those who didn't care for her. It was
then that she burned her skirts and became a boy - Corin Stonewall, Folk
Keeper. She ruled the cellar, keeping the Folk from turning the milk sour and
other minor inconveniences. Then she is taken from the orphanage and taken to a
strange man who knows her secrets. He commands her to be Folk Keeper of a great
manor by the coast. Strange things begin to happen to her, things she can't
explain. She tends to the Folk of the manor and spends time with a young man,
Finian. This is her Folk Record and journal - <u>The Folk Keeper.</u> This book
keeps you wondering what is going to happen and turning the pages until the
end. I liked this book and its mythical creatures and how it tells about a girl
trying to figure out just what and who she is. I would recommend this book to
girls thirteen to fifteen. </span></p>

<p><strong><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
Forestwife</span></u></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary
is a young girl who ran away from an arranged marriage. She an her nurse,
Agnes, together went searching for the Forestwife, only to find out that she
had died. From that point, Agnes took over as the Forestwife, and Mary was
called Marion. This is a stunning re-telling of the classic Robin Hood Story, a
must-read for anyone who enjoys medieval period literature. I would recommend
it to anyone who loves an adventure of has a fascination with Sherwood Forest
and Robin Hood.-</span></p>

Aunt Queen died, Gerald is now in a home with his abusive step father, Jordan,
and his drug-addicted mother, Monique. He and his step sister, Angel, are
trying to get away from Jordan for good. What is bad about it: It has some
scary threats and Gerald getting punched in the face by Jordan. What is good
about it: It shows how you can deal with domestic violence and child abuse. Who
might enjoy the book: I think people who are in need of help from child abuse
would enjoy the book.</span></p>

that is is to be the new Receiver of Memory. At first, the memories are
wonderful - an then he learns something terrible. He must make his choice - and
there is no going back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked this book because it is set in a
futuristic community, and it had the idea that perfection comes at a price. I
would recommend this book for people ages 14 - 15.</span></p>

parents had been before his birth. Glad to get away from Petunia, Vernon, and
Dudley Harry leaves for Hogwarts. Harry quickly befriends Ron Weasly, Hermoine

the most highly ranked dormitory of Hogwarts. What Harry and his friends don't
count on are three headed dogs, Filch, Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, Peeves, a
ghost who caused more trouble than anyone could imagine, and a boy named Draco

taken from a man from Harry's past for good?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I recommend this book to
everyone. If you like Sci Fi or Fantasy this book's for you. First in the seven
book series, this book is the shortest and one of the best. if you like this
book then read Harry Potter Year Two the Chamber of Secrets.<strong><u><o:p></o:p></u></strong></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This book is a real laugh
riot and I especially enjoyed it. It is the first book in the Hitchhiker Trilogy,
and is really, truly, amazingly funny and manages to make no sense at all. If
you don't like to be confused, don't read this book, but if you enjoy a good
laugh, you must absolutely have to read this book!<strong><u><span

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
book <u>Homecoming</u> by Cynthia Voigt is a great novel. It is a tale of the
Tillerman children who must make it on their own when their mother abandons
them on their way to their Aunt Cillia's house. This story follows the
Tillermans through their triumphs &amp; troubles as they follow the road to a
home and happiness. The best thing about this book is its realism. you feel the
pain of the children lost, on their own in a big, threatening world. This book
is for all audiences who aren't' afraid of facing the truth of hard situations,
and just in general, I believe almost anyone could enjoy this book. I highly
recommend that you read this book and follow the Tillermans as they struggle to
survive with little money and on their way to what they hope will be a house
and home holding love.</span></p>

finding them. Dicey tries to make enough money along their route. She must also
find suitable places to stay. Can Dicey face the odds and find her Aunt? I
liked how Dicey took everything into her hands and how she took responsibility.
I think any person that likes to read adventure stories will like this book
although it's really suitable for girls.</span></p>

meets Cat. He decides to adopt the orange stray - partially because he feels
sorry for the cat, and partially to spite he dog-loving father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>It's Like this, Cat</u> is a great book for
teens because many teens will be able to relate to Dave and his problems. I
liked this book because of how realistic and funny it is, and I would recommend
it for people between 10 and 15. This book is also a Newbery Medal Winner.</span></p>

here that he meets an old mouse, Vurg, and an old hare, Beau, who tell him
about his father's last and greatest adventure. <u>The Legend of Luke</u>, told
by master storyteller Brian Jacques, is a fantastic addition to the Redwall

characters. I would recommend it to all fantasy fans and Redwall readers as
being a book you simply can't put down once you pick it up!</span></p>
