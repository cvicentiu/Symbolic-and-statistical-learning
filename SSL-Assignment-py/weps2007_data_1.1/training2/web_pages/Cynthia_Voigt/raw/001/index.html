Cynthia Voigt was born in Boston, MA, and received her education at Smith College. She worked as a secretary and as a teacher before beginning her writing career in 1981. According to Ms Voigt, "I enjoy almost everything I do, perhaps because when I don't enjoy something, I don't do it." She has written many books and short stories, all with well-developed characters, interesting plots and authentic atmosphere.

Cynthia has won many awards for her children's and young adult books. Among these awards were the Newbery Medal for <B>Dicey's Song</B> and, in 1990, the California Young Reader's Award for <B>Izzy, Willy Nilly</B>. Most recently, the versatile author turned to a more gritty, realistic choice of subject matter in <B>When She Hollers</B>, a riveting novel about a teenager who decides to defend herself against her stepfather's abuse.
