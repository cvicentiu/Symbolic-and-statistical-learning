<h3>A Transactional Reading of Cynthia Voigt's <a href="#Voigt"><i>
Jackaroo</i></a>:<br>
The Prophetic Art of Friendly Instruction</h3>

<p><a href="#About Author"><i>Jim Garrison</i></a></p>

<p><a href="#Emotion">John Dewey (1934, 1987)</a> felt "that poetry
teaches as friends and life teach, by being, and not by express
intent" <a href="#Emotion">(p. 349)</a>. For young readers books
are friends; often the best friends they have. Books can open up
worlds of possibility and satisfy needs and desires, and sustain
hopes and dreams when all others, including teachers, parents, and
peers, fail. Books are warm and caring friends. They can also
discipline and disturb us by listening well, speaking sincerely,
and giving us a different perspective on things.</p>

<p>I want to provide an example of a book that teaches by being a
friend. The book is <a href="#Voigt">Cynthia Voigt's <i>
Jackaroo</i></a>. Some friends can be dangerous. I believe this
book goes beyond the norms of conventional good and evil. It is an
instance of creative, imaginative criticism; that is, the most
penetrating criticism. <a href="#Voigt"><i>Jackaroo</i></a> is
potentially prophetic to its readers. My reading of <a href=
"#Voigt"><i>Jackaroo</i></a> is my own. It is the response of one
reader to a text. My approach is influenced by <a href=
"#Rosenblatt">Louise M. Rosenblatt's</a> widely influential "reader
response" theory of literary interpretation. This choice is far
from arbitrary. Consider the subtitle of one of <a href=
"#Rosenblatt">Rosenblatt's (1978, 1994)</a> most famous works: <a
href="#Rosenblatt"><i>The Reader, the Text, the Poem: The
Transactional Theory of the Literary Work</i></a>. <a href=
"#Rosenblatt">Rosenblatt</a> explicitly acknowledges her debt to
Dewey throughout this book; for instance, in her preface she admits
that "<a href="#Experience">Dewey's <i>Art as Experience</i></a>
especially left its mark, perhaps more through its vision of
aesthetic values woven into the texture of the daily life of human
beings than its specific treatment of the literary arts" (p. xi).
Our interest in <a href="#Emotion">Dewey</a> is precisely his
vision of moral and aesthetic values woven into the texture of the
daily life of human beings. His aesthetic opinions regarding any
specific art form, including literature, do not concern us.</p>

<p><a href="#Rosenblatt">Rosenblatt</a> provides us with an
extraordinarily good summary of <a href="#Emotion">Dewey's</a>
entire transactional philosophy of value conflict, choice, and
self-creation:</p>

<p>Recall&#133; the Deweyan reminder that the organism plays an
active and selective role in the transactional response to
environment. As important as the interdependence of the self and
the world is the potentiality of choice among alternatives, the
capacity to revise and reshape our perceptions and our
actions&#133;. For the individual reader, each text is a new
situation, a new challenge. The literary work of art, we have seen,
is an important kind of transaction with the environment precisely
because it permits such self-aware acts of consciousness. The
reader, bringing his own particular temperament and fund of past
transactions to the text, lives thorough a process of handling new
situations, new attitudes, new personalities, new conflicts in
values. <a href="#Rosenblatt">(p.&nbsp;172)</a>.</p>

<p>The process of vicariously living through new situations, new
conflicts in values through transactions with texts, or more
exactly, the transactions between the culturally funded text of the
person and the literary text at hand, requires that we reconsider
and possibly revise our answer to the basic existential question of
how we should live. I admit bringing my own Deweyan temperament and
fund of past transactions to my reading of <a href="#Voigt"><i>
Jackaroo</i></a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Voigt"><i>Jackaroo</i></a> is set somewhere in the
Middle Ages were the peasants, especially the women, are silenced
by suspicion and fear. They often tell the old stories, especially
of the legendary hero Jackaroo, although they only somewhat believe
what they say. Gwyn is different because she questions, imagines,
and undergoes different feelings than those around her. The book
begins in the heart of a brutal winter with Gwyn in the "Doling
Room," where she has gone to receive a dole of food. Gwyn's basic
conflict of values and context of choice is established early:</p>

<p>Men didn't come to the Doling Room. The shame would be too great
for a man to carry. So the women carried it, Gwyn thought. It was a
hard thing to be a woman, her mother had often told her&#133;. In
the spring, then, she would have to say yes to some man, or let Da
announce her intention never to marry. One or the other, because
service in a Lord's house was unimaginable. One or the other was
her choice, and she liked neither; but she could do nothing about
the hardness of that&#133;. There was no one here to recognize her,
the Innkeeper's daughter from the Ram's Head, but between the
bitter envy of those whom hunger held close and the danger of
traveling without a man's protection, she preferred to be unknown.
(p. 4)</p>

<p>It is not difficult to intuit the quality of this passage.
Gwyn's world is a man's world. It is also hierarchically organized
according to social class. There are the Lords and the peasants.
Gwyn is a peasant, but a privileged one as we will learn. In Gwyn's
world a woman's choices are limited. She may choose service in the
Lord's house or not, and she may choose to marry or not. Either way
she ultimately will be governed by men, either the Lord of the
manor or her father, and after his death her bratty younger
brother. The roles women may dramatically identify themselves with
as potential acts and deeds are few. Women in Gwyn's world are
captured by exclusive <i>either/or</i>s. Her choices are false
choices prescripted by the social customs of the culture into which
she was born. Her life is tracked by the customs of her culture.
There is also irony in this passage, especially in the first and
last sentences. What it means to be strong is called into question
in the first sentence, and what Gwyn might in fact prefer for
herself given her immediate situation is anonymity. Irony and
ironic reversal prevails throughout this novel.</p>

<p>We soon learn that Gwyn's family is prosperous. Her father is a
prudent innkeeper who has amassed considerable wealth. As one of
the waiting women remarks bitterly, "The Innkeeper at the Rams'
Head lives like a Lord, fattening on the lean years" (p.&nbsp;8).
As a matter of fact he does exploit the poor in bad times such as
the Kingdom is now in. Gwyn herself wonders, "Why should she feel
badly to have warm, dry feet? Or guilty -- because she felt guilty
too -- that she had good fortune and did nothing to share it" (p.
13). Gwyn, as it turns out, is not in the Doling Room for herself
or her family; she is there for "old Megg" because her friend is
too feeble to come herself. As she leaves the Doling Room, she sees
an old woman and offers to accompany her home to provide safety in
numbers and help her carry the load. We can already see Gwyn's
character beginning to emerge. Gwyn is reflective, has emotional
sympathy, and is perceptive. We can also see that there is
ambiguity and tension in her and in the world within which she
lives. We wonder, what will she do?</p>

<p>At home we learn more of Gwyn's character. Her mother observes,
"If it's not your imagination that gets you into trouble it'll be
your soft heart" (p. 40). Gwyn has an unconcealing imagination that
is able to see beyond the actual: "Such snow, Gwyn thought, had a
way of turning the world into what it was not and making it seem
safe. Such snow masked the true face of the world" (p. 41). In self
reflection Gwyn recognizes the difference between her and her
sister Rose, who is so eager to marry: "Whatever Rose did, whatever
gesture she used, there was something dainty to it. Gwyn had never
seen herself, but she felt inside herself a strength that flowed
down her arms and legs, she could feel it especially in her
shoulders" (p. 44-45). Gwyn feels and knows that she possesses a
physical strength that defies the customary gender construction in
her culture. Excellencies of character, including discriminating
judgment, emotional susceptibility, and force of execution are all
part of Gwyn's character. It is vital to the story that these
virtues are all seen as deficiencies by her family and community.
Docility, unquestioning conformity, and obedience to law are the
virtues customarily associated with "good" members of her social
class and her gender. To be free, to know and recreate her self,
Gwyn will need to go beyond the social conventions of her
culture.</p>

<p>Gwyn has many virtues, but she still needs to grow. <a href=
"#Voigt">Voigt's</a> heroines frequently grow by learning through
relationships with males. These relationships are almost always
between equals and without romance, although with a great deal of
earned respect. <a href="#Voigt">Voigt</a> often displays patterns
of warm helpful friendship between males and females, often with
significant differences in age. The relationships are typically
between those whose differences are considerable, but wherein each
has something that the other needs. In <a href="#Voigt"><i>
Jackaroo</i></a> such a relationship is established between Gwyn
and a young ("Almost eleven") Lordling when they become stranded in
the dead of a very hard winter in an abandoned cabin.</p>

<p>The young Lordling, Gadrian, is ill-prepared to care for himself
in such hardship. He was also accustomed to aristocratic privilege.
In the case of the Lordling's needs, Gwyn's responses are
prefigured by her being accustomed to caring for her brother (who
in many ways is even less able to care for himself than the
Lordling, although he is older) as much as it is to the necessity
of serving the needs of the Lords. Whatever his deficiencies, the
young Lordling has inner strength and determination to care for
himself. Further, Gwyn is forced to admit to herself, "For all that
he was so much younger than she was, he had a much broader
knowledge of the world" (p. 125). Gadrian, like all of the ruling
class, knows how to read and write, and he teaches Gwyn. Such
instruction is strictly forbidden by the customs of the Kingdom.
Gadrian enlarges Gwyn's world. He and his father make maps; in
fact, that is how they became stranded. Gwyn and Burl, a burly
servant in the Inn, had guided the Lord and Lordling to the
frontiers of the land, the Lord and his son had verified some of
the topography and they were on their way back when they were
separated and stranded in the snow storm. The young boy knows what
is beyond the mountains; Gwyn does not. That knowledge is a
metaphor for the power of knowledge the Lords use to rule the
peasants, and that, for all of her intuitiveness, Gwyn lacks.</p>

<p>Gadrian has other needs. Most of all Gwyn is able to comfort him
over the recent death of his mother. If Gwyn has unusual physical
strength, Gadrian displays remarkable emotional perceptiveness. As
Gwyn strives to comfort Gadrian, their conversations come to have
the quality of an inquiry into the meaning of life and death for
both. Together they dare for the first time to address the
fundamental existential questions. She also teaches him to fight
with a peasant's weapon, the staff, something she is surprisingly
adept at. In turn, she learns how to use a sword. Gadrian learns
the virtues of hard work and being able to take care of himself,
even when he does not enjoy it. They each ask one another questions
they "had no right to ask" (p. 119). These questions transcend the
norms of acceptable discourse between men and women as well as
Lords and peasants. They both learn a great deal about the lives of
the other. Gwyn has to admit, "She enjoyed his idea of her" (p.
120).</p>

<p>In this long interlude suspended by bitter winter from the rest
of the world, Gadrian and Gwyn becomes friends and learn a great
deal from and about each other and their lives. The grand questions
are addressed; what is life, how should we live, and what does it
mean? The answers of a Lordling and an Innkeeper's daughter are
quite different. At the end both are changed. It is important that
much of this "conversation" involves learning to <i>do</i> what the
other does and care for each other's needs. There is tension and
conflict in this relationship that will never go entirely away.
These two people are different, but their tensions are creative,
and they bestow a great deal of value upon each other because they
have the moral courage to live with the conflicts.</p>

<p>There are two brilliant moments of radiantly clear perception
for Gwyn in the novel. Neither involves critical appraisal alone.
Rather, the reality of her situation is simply disclosed to her.
Both of them occur either on occasions of violent death or near
death. The first occurs when, at winter thaw, Gadrian and Gwyn make
their way back to the Inn, where Gadrian's father has been waiting
in dread that he has lost his son. Demonstrating the skills Gwyn
had taught him about covering his tracks in the snow, a lesson that
had resembled playing hide and seek, Gadrian rushes ahead by a
different route that Gwyn cannot follow. Gadrian is a good student.
When Gwyn arrives at the Inn alone, the Lord, thinking his son dead
and blaming her, immediately draws his sword and places the blade
to her throat fully intending to have his revenge at the cost of
her life. Her family is frozen with fear and can say or do nothing.
Only Burl defends her by demanding that the Lord "hear her" because
Burl avers, "I know her" (p. 129). He does. We do not know what
would have happened to Gwyn next, because it is at this moment that
Gadrian breaks into the room. It is also at this moment that Gwyn
sees through everything. It is a moment of truth, and truth can be
ugly. In the same instant she loses belief in both her family and
the wisdom of those that rule the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The unconcealment is put into words only after Gwyn has left the
room and first the Lord and then Burl follow. The dialogue begins
with the Lord speaking:</p>

<p>"How was I to Know--" "Aye, the Lords know nothing of the
people--" "--when you didn't say--" "--and care little for what
they know or do not know," Gwyn finished. He warned her then "You
shall not speak to me so." So Gwyn stopped speaking. She held his
eyes and held her tongue. But the anger burned in her&#133;. At
last the Lord broke their silence. "I would know how the Innkeeper
got such a daughter, and such a servant" he said. "The irony of it
is that now you will never trust me and now you can trust me for
anything." (pp. 129-130)</p>

<p>There are many ironies and reversals in this exchange. The Lord
is a little like King Lear -- he only knows what he hears stated.
Gwyn knows that the Lords have power over the people, but without
knowledge of those they govern (something that will turn out to be
far less true than it appears at the moment -- <a href="#Voigt">
Voigt</a> is relentlessly ambivalent in her characterizations, and
Gwyn's perception here is not perfect). She holds her tongue as she
holds his eye. Her courage is tempered, as it should be, by
prudence. There are no rules that govern such morally ambiguous
situations as these, only wisdom. Power is real and dangerous for
the perceptive and courageous as well as the inattentive and
timid.</p>

<p>The dialogue continues with Burl after the Lord has left:</p>

<p>"You cannot be angry at them, Gwyn," Burl's voice said behind
her. "They thought of what they would have done in the same
situation. Later, when they had thought more they--" "Later would
have been too late, wouldn't it?" Gwyn asked, surprising herself by
her calm. "The Lords don't stand under the law." "They are the
law." "It's their own law." "Aye. They will not want you to have
seen," he advised her. Gwyn knew which <i>they</i> he meant. She
knew also how they must be feeling now, to know they had betrayed
her so sick at heart. She was the one betrayed and she felt a death
in her heart. How would they feel, being the betrayers. Well then,"
she said, "I will not have seen." What had been done could not be
undone. What she had understood could not be forgotten. "It will be
a small lie." (pp. 130-131)</p>

<p>The loss of belief, expressed most clearly by her anger, in the
depth of her family's love or the wisdom of the law of the Lords,
is paradoxically liberating and it takes her past conventional good
and evil. There is a death in her heart. Her comfortable habitual
ways of responding to authority, her self, her personal identity
has been destroyed. If love can be lost then anything can die. That
it is ambiguous at first who "they" (Lords or family) are is itself
revealing. The last sentence of the first half of the novel reads,
"The lie would be pretending that everything had not changed" (p.
131). Gwyn has seen beyond the actual, but as yet she lacks any
vision of the possible. The irony of the last line for the
remainder of the book is that, having unmasked the actual
situation, it is a mask that will open up the possibilities that
lie beyond the good and evil of the law and love she has "known."
The last sentence in the opening paragraph of the next section
reads, "She wore her face like a mask" (p. 135). Similar passages
are found throughout the second half of the novel where, indeed,
masks of all kinds play a prominent role. Such dramatic recognition
and reversal is quite common to quality literature. It is a part of
self-discovery and creation.</p>

<p><a href="#Voigt">Voigt</a> divides her novel into halves (there
are no chapter titles, just the titles of the two halves). The
first half was titled "the Innkeeper's Daughter." At the end of the
first half of the novel, Gwyn is not only no longer the Innkeeper's
daughter, she is in the possession of no one, including herself. It
is here that her inquiry into herself, and the social scripts that
created the roles she has played, begins. Gwyn's search for her
self, paradoxically, involves donning a mask: the mask of an
outlaw, the Jackaroo. Gwyn had found the costume of the Jackaroo
while she and the Lordling were stranded in old Megg's cottage. By
dramatically identifying with the values the mask, and the deeds,
feelings, and thoughts associated with it, Gwyn eventually
recreates her self.</p>

<p>We learn early in the second section, simply titled <a href=
"#Voigt">"Jackaroo,"</a> that Gwyn has decided not to marry, even
though her father is prepared to bestow his inheritance on her.
When she made the announcement, "She understood herself&Eacute;.
She would not throw her days away caring for the comfort of some
man who asked for a bag of twelve gold pieces, never mind the girl
who came with it" (p. 141). The reference to gold is to the gift
bestowed upon Gwyn by the Lord for saving his son. The gift, in
conjunction with being the Innkeeper's daughter, means that Gwyn is
a highly attractive catch, and that she could have her choice of
available men. Gwyn might well imagine it a source of social
security and independence, but, significantly, she does not. Gwyn's
loss is complete. She no longer knows herself; indeed she has lost
her self identity. What she does know is that she can never return
to her former self. She does not want to marry and she knows it,
but she is in doubt about what to do with her life and her emotions
are a conscious sign of the break:</p>

<p>It was not that she wanted to change her mind. Far from it,
although she understood her own reasons for that no better than she
understood the reasons for the many other changes she felt taking
place within herself. A few years earlier, when her body had so
suddenly changed, she had felt awkward and uneasy, unsure; she
recognized that same feeling now, but it was not her body that
caused it, it was her self. Everybody seemed a stranger to her now,
even the Innkeeper's daughter, Gwyn, herself. (p. 160)</p>

<p>The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing. Doubt for
<a href="#Emotion">Dewey</a> was a living, embodied, and
impassioned condition. On such a Deweyan account we can say Gwyn's
unconscious habitual ways of functioning have been disrupted, but
as of yet she has no idea of what to do. The analogy to profound
bodily changes during an earlier life transition for Gwyn expresses
well why the search for self is as much, or more, a matter of
feeling and embodiment as it is of mind. Indeed, for the Deweyan,
separating the mind from the body and feelings is to construct a
false dualism. Understanding such profound unconscious
transformations requires sustained reflective inquiry. Gwyn's
feelings of tension are yet to evolve and become more specific and
nameable. Gwyn's intuitions concerning the quality of her situation
are acute, and at least she knows what is conventionally lauded and
rewarded is no longer possible for her even if she has no vision of
what is. Before she knows how to act she will have to refine her
intuitions further by attending to things in her world that seem
horribly obvious, but that almost no one else notices. She has
learned a lot, but her vulnerabilities have placed her at great
risk. In order to figure things out, Gwyn will need to take
incredible risks.</p>

<p>The widely accepted traditional theory of emotions, traceable at
least to <a href="#Darwin">Charles Darwin (1873, 1901)</a>, asserts
emotions precede their expression; the pattern being one of
stimulus, feeling, action. <a href="#William">William James (1890,
1950, Vol. I)</a> constructed a theory of emotion that in effect
reversed this series to get one of stimulus, action, and feeling <a
href="#William">(p. 219)</a>. For example, when we flee a dangerous
situation, the action gives rise to the emotion of fear. <a href=
"#Emotion">Dewey</a> was influenced by this view, but ultimately
rejected it in favor of one in which naming a feeling was simply an
abstraction from a complex emergent coordination of an active
response to a needful situation.</p>

<p><a href="#Emotion">Dewey's (1894, 1971)</a> position was that
"the mode of behavior is the primary thing, and that the idea and
the emotional excitation are constituted at one and the same time;
they represent the tension of stimulus and response within the
coordination which makes up the mode of behavior" (p. 174). So what
is this review of <a href="#Emotion">Dewey's</a> theory of emotions
doing here in the middle of Gwyn's deliberations about herself, her
world, and what she ought to do? The answer is this: one can act
<i>intelligently</i> without reasons.</p>

<p>Sometimes to know who we are, we must act according to our
intuitions and imaginings and without reason. Once we do something,
then we have something to reflect upon and reasons for further
actions may follow:</p>

<p>No reason, Gwyn thought later, striding through the woods. How
could she know the reasons for anything when she didn't even
understand the reasons for which she was where she was, dressed as
she was [as Jackaroo], and for what purpose. The high boots
shielded her legs from snapping branches, the mask hung close over
her face and the short red cape swung with her shoulders. Her heart
sang. (p.&nbsp;162)</p>

<p>Given the political institutions and rules of policy in her
world, Gwyn can only find the ideal factors of morality beyond good
and evil. There is prophetic wisdom and sympathetic perception in
what Gwyn is about to do. What she does is give one of her gold
pieces to the poor Fiddler who had come to her father but was
unable to strike a deal to save his humble holdings. In the act of
giving, acting behind a mask, and as an outlaw, Gwyn begins to
recognize herself. From partially precognitive origins Gwyn's
outlaw emotions lead to the acts of an outlaw and eventually to
wise, kind, and considerate acts that lie beyond good and evil.</p>

<p>The lessons learned while stranded with the Lordling provide the
technical skill she requires to carry out the deception. Gwyn knows
how to carry herself with aristocratic swagger and speak with
authority (i.e., "the cadence of Gadrian's speech") as well as
aloof assertiveness (eventually the docility of the peasants before
all this will begin to disturb her). Gwyn is beginning to tell the
truth of the ugliness of her world to herself and to humankind in
acting out the role of the outlaw hero Jackaroo. Having acted out
in the world, she can begin to see herself in the reflection of
others.</p>

<p>The excitement of the action is liberating and intoxicating to
her and so later, "Gwyn allowed the laughter that had been building
up to go free. She laughed aloud. The laughter flowed out into the
trees and rose up into the blue sky, like a song" (p. 164). These
feelings, emotions, and sense of release repeat themselves
throughout the latter stages of this novel -- although often with
an ironic twist. I want to suggest that such emotions are
especially important for prophetic and creative action beyond the
limits of conventional good and evil. Unlike other creatures, we
not only have feelings, we can also know them and in knowing them,
in making conscious what we have and are, we can come to know
ourselves and our motives, and the social customs that created
them, better. Through feeling, action, and reflection, we may come
to know and create our own mind. This is what happens to Gwyn when
she dons the costume of and dramatically identifies herself with
the outlaw role of the Jackaroo.</p>

<p>The feminist writer <a href="#Jagger">Alison M. Jagger</a> holds
a theory of emotion that closely resembles <a href="#Emotion">
Dewey's</a>. For both, raw feeling are innate neurophysiological
states. They are vague and undirected. Feelings are merely
passively had. Emotions, on the other hand, are intentional and
goal-directed. For <a href="#Jagger">Jagger</a>, as for <a href=
"#Emotion">Dewey</a>, the meaning and value of our emotions, like
everything that is human, is socially prescripted and "like all
social constructs, they are historical products bearing the marks
of the society that constructed them" (<a href="#Jagger">Jagger,
1989, p. 159</a>). So what would happen if someone like Gwyn were
to challenge the prevailing social construction? She would
experience outlaw emotions and might even become an outlaw.</p>

<p><a href="#Jagger">Jagger</a> discusses "emotional hegemony and
emotional subversion." Gwyn is an emotional subversive. <a href=
"#Jagger">Jagger</a> asserts:</p>

<p>People who experience conventionally unacceptable, or what I
call "outlaw," emotions often are subordinated individuals who pay
a disproportionately high price for maintaining the status
quo&#133;. When unconventional emotional responses are experienced
by isolated individuals, those concerned may be confused, unable to
name their experience; they may even doubt their own
sanity....Outlaw emotions may be politically because
epistemologically subversive&#133;. Outlaw emotions are
distinguished by their incompatibility with the dominant
perceptions and values&#133;. <a href="#Jagger">(p. 160)</a></p>

<p>Gwyn does not know the meaning of her outlaw emotions. She seems
to even doubt her own sanity, until she acts on them and the world
reflects back on her the mythological role of the Jackaroo. <a
href="#Jagger">Jagger</a> helps us understand one other thing about
<a href="#Emotion">Dewey's</a> theory of emotions.</p>

<p><a href="#Jagger">Jagger</a> writes, "The most obvious way in
which&Eacute; outlaw emotions can help in developing alternatives
to prevailing conceptions of reality is by motivating new
investigations&Eacute;. Theoretical investigation is always
purposeful and observation is always selective" <a href="#Jagger">
(p. 161)</a>. Having outlaw emotions are part of what it means to
be a prophet. <a href="#Jagger">Jagger</a> continues:</p>

<p>As well as motivating critical research, outlaw emotions may
also enable us to perceive the world differently from its portrayal
in conventional descriptions. They may provide the first
indications that something is wrong with the way alleged facts have
been constructed with accepted understandings of how things
are&#133;. We may bring to consciousness our `gut-level' awareness
that we are in a situation of coercion, cruelty, injustice, or
danger&#133;. [We] may make subversive observations that challenge
dominant conceptions of the status quo. <a href="#Jagger">(p.
160)</a></p>

<p>Gwyn surely makes subversive observations as a result of her
outlaw emotions, and she acts on them in ways whose consequences
take her beyond conventional good and evil. In many cases it is her
actions that give rise to the emotions and thoughts. What <a href=
"#Jagger">Jagger</a> adds, though, is the idea that, "Oppressed
people have a kind of epistemological privilege insofar as they
have easier access to this standpoint and therefore a better chance
of ascertaining the possible beginnings of a society in which all
could thrive" <a href="#Jagger">(p. 161)</a>. I believe that Gwyn
has precisely this kind of troubling, and trouble-causing,
emotional perceptions. We can see it in her emotional responses at
the Spring Fair, at which her sister Rose is married and the
announcement that Gwyn will not marry is made.</p>

<p>The Fair is the second moment of radiantly clear perception for
Gwyn. Again, the reality of the situation is immediately
unconcealed; this time on the occasion of a violent death. In the
midst of the wedding ceremony Gwyn's gaze moves up the city
wall:</p>

<p>She caught her breath. There, at the top of the wall, a body
hung from a scaffold, its head down, turning in the wind. Its hands
were bound behind it, and it looked, at the distance, like a broken
doll or a scarecrow&#133;. It made Gwyn uneasy. Why would the Earl
leave him up there, on this day? It was as if the hanged man were
on display there, to warn, to cause fear. Who had he been? What had
he done? (p. 168)</p>

<p>A scare crow, or a scare <i>homo sapien sapiens</i>? The
perception of the man on the scaffold is one that Gwyn returns to
repeatedly during her day at the fair. It is not just that she
cannot stop seeing him that disturbs her most, though; it is that
no one else does. Gwyn reflects</p>

<p>Nobody else saw him, nobody else looked to him. Only Gwyn. And
who would want such a girl for his wife, if he knew what she saw.
If, Gwyn thought, there were one of these young men who also saw
the hanged man, then that one she might take. But if they saw, they
did not speak of it, as if by not speaking they could make it
disappear, and such men Gwyn would not marry. (p. 181)</p>

<p>The irony, of which there are many in this book, is that there
is a man she knows well that has seen, has even told her why the
man was hanged because he knew she would want to know. For all of
her amazing perception, Gwyn cannot see the love that is closest to
her and that has given her ample evidence that he understands and
cares for her.</p>

<p>Tad, in a successful effort to hurt Gwyn, blurts out, "You're
not a proper girl at all. You might as well be wearing trousers and
a beard" (p. 174). Gwyn is different. She is physically strong,
strong enough to play the Jackaroo and get away with it, but not
coquettish enough to pander to men and procure a husband. In a day
of reflective self understanding, "Gwyn realized that much as she
might long to fit in, she was also glad she did not. Tad had said
it to hurt her, but it was the truth just the same&Eacute;. She fit
into this world as the hanged man did, she thought. She could not
see his form where she stood, but he dangled at the edge of the
fair, and she did not forget that. Let others forget" (p. 176).
Gwyn cannot help seeing, and she cannot help remembering. Having
awoken from the common dream, she cannot go back to sleep. You
appear strange and awkward to yourself as well as others when you
can no longer see as others do. It is a conflicted, complicated,
and clumsy way to be.</p>

<p>Gwyn continues to ride as the Jackaroo, the one who rights
wrongs. She finds it "odd that dressed up as Jackaroo she felt much
more like herself&Eacute;. she liked herself. And in the disguise,
she was free to do what she really wanted to do, much freer than
was Gwyn, the Innkeeper's daughter&Eacute;. Gwyn had never been so
pleased with her life" (p. 196). Gwyn is becoming her destiny, but
the sense of exhilaration and freedom begins to fade before the
ironies and paradoxes of her role in this culture. The laughter of
the Jackaroo takes a bitter turn. Gwyn begins reflecting on the
paradoxes of freedom.</p>

<p>Acting the script for the role of the Jackaroo draws out of Gwyn
actions for which she did not even know she had the potential. What
the role begins to demand of her, however, leads to a stunning
perception. Riding as Jackaroo, she comes across robbers that have
killed a woman and her husband. Upon her arrival they flee into the
woods and disappear. Nearby she finds the couple's child in the
bushes where he was hidden. What was Gwyn, or the Jackaroo, to do?
The child needs a mother and Gwyn's older sister Blithe had lost
her son and spent the last year in irreconcilable despair. Riding
up to Blithe's cottage, Gwyn simply places the child on the table
and declares, "Woman, you will raise this child." Blithe protests,
"No&Eacute;I will have none but my own son." The Jackaroo commands
with the authority of a Lord, "You will take this child and he will
be your son&Eacute;. He has need of you, woman" (p. 200). The
command is obeyed and Blithe soon becomes firmly attached to the
child. The Jackaroo saw the best possibility in a needful situation
for the child, Blithe, and the Jackaroo and acted appropriately to
actualize the good. What she did was necessary, but hear the
irony?</p>

<p>Unable physically to confront the three robbers, the Jackaroo,
who succeeds by daring, deception, and cunning and not physical
prowess, contrives a successful plan for having them captured and
hung. The Jackaroo also helps Am, the pig herder, and his daughter;
but Am is a fool. By boasting about his windfall from the Jackaroo,
he is robbed of it and all the rest he owned. His situation, bad
before, is now desperate. His best hope is to find someone to take
in his children. On this occasion, "Gwyn had no pity for him. It
was his own loose tongue that had done this to him, and he felt
only pity for himself. The man was spineless. The two coins had
been wasted on him&Eacute;. It was little use to give him gold. If
she could find a fine, strong-tongued woman to drive him, that
might be of use to him" (p. 225). The voice of Gwyn's father may be
heard in this passage. Gwyn herself is often referred to as
"Strong-tongued" in the novel. When earlier in the novel her Da
offers to name her his heir instead of Tad, he nonetheless remarks,
"I would want you to have a husband, to govern you" (p. 215). It
becomes clear later that Tad will grow up sturdier than earlier
thought, so Da asks Gwyn for her advice. She agrees that Tad could
eventually learn to run the Inn well, but observes, "You must find
him someone strong and steady to marry, someone who can govern him
when he needs it" (p. 251). Here we start becoming trapped in the
paradoxes of freedom that embroider the second half of this novel.
These paradoxes are part of the fact that human beings do need each
other not only to live well, but to live at all. Da and Gwyn are
right, after a fashion, in what they say.</p>

<p>Negative freedom, freedom <i>from</i> constraint, obsesses us.
For many it is the only kind of freedom they know. To be free <i>
for</i> something, we must bind ourselves to it. If we answer a
calling, say to teach, we are bound by the virtues of the vocation;
we have no choice (although, to answer a call responsibly we must
annul it). We almost never ask ourselves what it is that we wish to
be free for. To be free for something, say our calling, requires
that we exercise practical reason and discipline ourselves to the
virtues of our vocation. Playing the socially constructed dramatic
role of the Jackaroo is an exercise in positive freedom. Gwyn must
become what the role demands, and one of the ironies of the
master-slave dialectic is that the master must do what the slave
will obey. The master has no choice. For the outlaw Jackaroo to
motivate "good" slaves to do what they ought to, he or she must
often exercise privileged authority and order them to obey. The
narrow social narratives of the slave make it difficult to imagine
alternatives, or act on them even if they do; that is one of the
true horrors of oppression, the oppressed can become so accustomed
to it that they often demand it. Remember how uncomfortable it has
been for Gwyn to abandon her habitual forms of slavish and feminine
conduct, as her cultural customs have constructed the roles. Once
we enter paradoxical situations, the dialectical reversals of
meaning begin to mount up. There is wisdom in <a href="#Voigt">
Voigt's</a> irony. Gwyn, and our, situation is quickly becoming
unpleasantly complicated.</p>

<p>Am is a fool; nevertheless his innocent daughter is in desperate
need. Gwyn ponders:</p>

<p>There were too many like Am among the people, too many who gave
up the fight. But what could you expect, when all of life was so
hard and hopeless? How could someone fight and know he never would
win? And who was the enemy? Could a man fight off a long winter or
a dry summer? No more than he could fight against the Lords. Aye,
the people could not manage without the Lords, they were children
unable to take care of themselves&#133;. Why should Jackaroo take
such risks, for such people&#133;. Aye, she had no choice in the
matter any more. (p.&nbsp;226)</p>

<p>For those of you, like me, who were expecting a typical young
woman's romance, things are getting surprisingly difficult. If you
assume a caring social role like teaching and if you play it well,
then you must do what those you care for need done. If you advance
the good of a calling, say teaching, then you must accept not only
that children are unable to take care of themselves, but that many
adults, including your colleagues and supervisors, cannot either.
You, like the Jackaroo, are often bound by the needs of others and
will have no choice. We are not talking about mere negative freedom
here; that is, the freedom to always do what you want. We are
talking about exercising positive freedom in a resistant and
imperfect world according to the virtues of your chosen vocation.
Those virtues bind you to the good your vocation seeks to secure.
There are no smooth hallways beyond conventional good and evil.</p>

<p>The reversals of self and identity begin to accelerate as this
novel moves toward its conclusion. When Jackaroo next rides, it is
with a double purpose: first, to disburse two more gold coins to
the fool Am; and second, to free Gwyn's uncle Win. Win is a
captured highwayman who had left many years before; Gwyn and the
family thought he was dead. Highwaymen are "journeyed" before
hanging as a warning to the people, and they had expected the
highwayman at the Inn for days. It was not until he and the escort
of soldiers arrived at Da's Inn that they knew who he was.
Distributing funds to fools presents no problems; Win does. Upon
the Jackaroo's appearance, Win begins laughing uncontrollably and
with genuine joy testifies, "I thought I had laughed my
last&Eacute;. Oh, but life always holds one more joke. I thank you,
whoever you are" (p. 231). He means it. Win had ridden as the
Jackaroo. It was a heavy burden upon him, so Win wonders,</p>

<p>"Did you know what it meant when you put on the mask?" Gwyn
shook her head, no. "Aye, you'll find it out. Maybe, if we knew,
we'd never dare to put it on, and maybe that's why nobody tells
that hated truth. Think you?" Gwyn had nothing to say. "Except
there is need now. That much, at least, is in your favor. You ride
in need. It'll make no difference in the end. Things will turn out
the same"&#133;. "Aye, because what changes putting on the mask had
begun, I had myself finished. So farewell to you, Jackaroo. I pity
you, with all that's left of my heart -- but that's not much&#133;.
"I'm out of the trap that held me, and it's that same trap you're
snared in Jackaroo&#133;." So she had no choice to claim her Uncle
Win. (p. 232-233)</p>

<p>Perhaps what one learns beyond good and evil is not so lovely.
Gwyn, though, is answering the call of authentic need; hers is a
prophet's vision. Both Hitler and Martin Luther King had the power
to create a vision. Prophecy, false or true, is usually a fatal
calling. So how do we distinguish true from false prophets? Both
Gwyn and Win are outlaws. Both have ridden as the Jackaroo and
performed outlawed actions. What is the difference when we are
beyond good and evil? It does matter that Gwyn rides with a
self-eclipsing sympathetic desire to respond to the genuine need of
others and not for glory, although she certainly had felt the
self-assertive exhilaration that entrapped Win. It also matters
that Gwyn's acts deprive her of the twelve gold pieces given her by
the Lord. Gwyn cares and is a kind, giving person who bestows her
bounty upon others in need. Finally, it matters that she grows
under the burden. Still, the outlaw fate of the Jackaroo begins to
close in and the paradoxes do mount.</p>

<p>The outlaw script for the dramatic role of the Jackaroo involves
real risks and places Gwyn in a vulnerable position. Embracing a
social role, responding to a calling, even responding responsibly
as Gwyn does, has an element of fate about it. To perform any
social role correctly we must do, feel, and think what the customs
of the culture require of the costume. To be a good teacher, we
must embrace the virtues of the vocation and strive to become, each
in our own unique way, what it is to be a good practitioner. The
demands of being a good teacher can often cause value conflicts. We
must make difficult, even tragic, choices. When the values of good
teaching and good practice, including the ethics of caring,
conflict with the rules of policy within a bureaucratic community,
or the ethics of justice, then good teachers must often go beyond
good and evil as "currently condemned or outlawed." Whether to
break the law or people is a tragic choice that arises because the
rule governed ethics of justice and the ethics of care are
sometimes incommensurable. Good teachers are often outlaws that
violate, at least the intent if not the letter, of laws,
regulations, and rules of policy to actualize the values of their
vocation. Many teachers have lied, or at least bent the truth, to
do the right thing by their students. The more oppressive the law,
the more imaginative must be the prophetic responses that create
alternative values. On such occasions the artful teacher is being
more moral than the moralities. Wisdom sometimes goes beyond an
exclusively rule driven ethics of justice; that is, it sometimes
goes beyond good and evil.</p>

<p>Win's words require Gwyn to reflect upon what she has become
through her acts:</p>

<p>He had been telling the truth, she understood that&#133;.
Knowing herself, she knew she could not&#133; hide the masquerade
away forever. She would ride as she was riding now, without any
joy&#133;. She would ride as she was riding now, in darkness,
because she was an outlaw. Jackaroo rode outside of the law, and
that was why the Lords wanted to take him. The law couldn't hold
Jackaroo. He would do what he wanted and that made him an outlaw.
Gwyn could never have chosen to be an outlaw. She hadn't chosen
that, she and only chosen to do what good she could, for people. It
was just as Mother said, she had too much imagination, too soft a
heart. She had not known what she was choosing. But even if she had
known, Gwyn knew that she would have chosen the same. This
knowledge was not sweet, not joyful....</p>

<p>Before the first dawn showed at the rim of the sky, Gwyn was
back in her own room with nobody -- except her -- the wiser. (pp.
234)</p>

<p>Gwyn has chosen to become her destiny. We each grow to the
largest limit we can attain without despair. There is only so much
disharmony, only so much destruction of personal identity that we
can take at any one time. Gwyn's losses are accumulating with her
wisdom. In losing herself she has grown wise. It is hard to move
agilely in the world when you are coming out of your skin, or when
you are caught between two worlds. Teachers need to remember this
when they tell students they must have the right values. Those
values may not be the values of family and friends, and how do we
know we have the right values? If <a href="#Emotion">Dewey</a> is
correct, then, altering habits means altering your identity and
that can be very difficult and very painful. How would you like to
live without support of family or friends? We are on treacherous
ground.</p>

<p>Part of Gwyn's fate, part of growing wise, is to understand the
larger pattern and rhythms of life. The Jackaroo can do what she or
he wants outside the law, but, paradoxically, with little choice.
Gwyn asks Burl, "Is there any reason&Eacute;why any one man should
serve another? (p. 248). Burl finds no reason; he only observes
that it is so. Gwyn ponders this:</p>

<p>"It's like a child's rhyme, Burl. The land serves the people,
the people serve the Lords, the Lords serve the Earls, the Earls
serve the King, and the King serves the land"&#133;. Even Jackaroo,
Gwyn thought to herself, fit into that circle. He served the
people. He served them outside of the law, but within the turning
of the wheel. (pp. 248-249)</p>

<p>Even in oppressive regimes everyone needs everyone else. That is
part of what makes the master-slave dialectic so vicious and
corrupting for all that participate. Without the hope provided by
the almost mythical Jackaroo to relieve their suffering, the people
might find it unbearable. They might either rebel, or lacking the
energy, just give up in despair and refuse to work. Besides,
without outlaws there would be less need for soldiers; and, without
soldiers it would be harder to create the fear necessary to govern
as the Lords see fit. Like adolescent rebellion, simply negating
oppressive laws is not real freedom. We are still bound by the laws
we negate. Real freedom requires prophetic and poetic creation.</p>

<p>Eventually, through her own fatuous daring, an innocent person
is falsely accused of being the Jackaroo. Events move quickly from
here as identities begin to change so rapidly that this reader at
least found it difficult to follow the action. For my part I felt a
bit of the nausea that must come to the Jackaroo in his, or her,
confused identity. Only an appearance by the "real" Jackaroo will
save the innocent individual; but Gwyn is caught unawares by the
swiftness with which the Lord will carry out the hanging. Just in
time someone appears as the Jackaroo. She recognizes that it is
Burl, although in a costume she does not recognize. Burl's getaway
is dangerous and difficult, so Gwyn must intervene in her own
masked costume. It is at this moment when she cannot reason out her
course of action carefully in advance that Gwyn realizes "exactly
how ill-prepared she was for the role she was playing" (p. 259). It
is rather like that first day in one's own class all alone.</p>

<p>Nearly fatally injured, Burl rescues her. We learn that Burl's
costume for the Jackaroo once belonged to Gwyn's Granda. In another
complicated turn, Gadrian's father, a Lord that in the aftermath of
the southern revolution had become one of the two Earls of the
Kingdom, appears himself as the Jackaroo. The demand is that the
Innkeeper convey to the Earl (the Lord that had become the Earl
that was now riding as the Jackaroo) the Jackaroo's desire that the
Innkeeper take "before his Lord [the Earl] the needs and requests
of the people and any of their quarrels that the Lord must settle"
(p. 271). These are glad tidings of better times.</p>

<p>If you find all of these rapid changes of the Jackaroo's
identity a farce, then you may have some haunting sense of what Win
found so frightfully funny. The tragic and comic masks are the
same; one is just the other upside down. On adolescent bodies
undergoing rapid growth, facial blemishes may appear suddenly
minutes before a date. Understanding these rapid and jarring
reversals provides us with a better idea of what it is like to be
young and still growing, where your identity changes so rapidly
that you cannot tell who you are, much less who those around you
are. Perhaps you also understand why most people stop growing so
early.</p>

<p>Gwyn wonders about the Lord, now the Earl of Sutherland,
appearing as the Jackaroo:</p>

<p>She had not thought that the Lords, too, would go outside their
own laws to ride as Jackaroo. What had Gadrian's father given up to
ride as Jackaroo? Unless it was only the Lords who could ride
outside of the law safely, and that was why any of the people who
did must pay -- for their high dreams, for taking a Lord's high
place&#133;. (p. 270-271)</p>

<p>It is significant that, according to the customary scripts of
this culture, any Lord or Earl who would do good by the people
would have to go beyond the law that they themselves make. What are
we to make of all of these Jackaroos? Burl realizes that the
costumes must be all over the Kingdom, and in any case easy to
tailor to fit anyone that has the potential to answer the call. The
role of the Jackaroo, the role of the outlaw that lives beyond good
and evil, seems to be a character that the land needs.</p>

<p>The novel ends with an irony that captures well some of the
paradoxes of freedom. The Lord has seen through Gwyn's mask; so too
has Burl and even her younger brother Tad. In the convoluted ending
of the novel, Gwyn must disappear. She is sent to the edge of her
world. The people assume that she ran off with one of her suitors,
Cam. That is their script for the vanishing of healthy head-strong
young women possessing gold pieces. Gwyn hides behind this one last
lie, and obeys the Lord's command that she live happily ever after.
The Lord commands Gwyn and Burl to live in and restore, with ample
funds provided, a hunting lodge at the frontiers of his lands. She
starts to object, but when she looks into the Lord's eyes she
reflects:</p>

<p>This was the man&#133;who had fled the intrigues of his father's
court to put himself under the protection of the King, letting his
brothers slaughter one another in their greed. Now he gathered up
their inheritance for his own. He was also the man&#133;who had
ridden as Jackaroo, for the sake of the people. He was a man to
respect and fear and trust. (p. 284)</p>

<p>Gwyn obeys reluctantly like a student obeying a respected
teacher. The last order the Lord gives requires that Gwyn marry
Burl. This is a romance after all. You probably had already guessed
it. Myself, I didn't until almost the very end. Yet I should have
remembered that Burl stood up for Gwyn when her family would not
because he knew her, and Gwyn overlooked the plain fact that Burl
saw the hanging man. Indeed, it was Burl that volunteered to her
why he was hanged without being asked because he knew she would
want to know. The Lord must command this extraordinarily perceptive
young woman to see what is closest and most dear to her, and the
man that by her own remarkable rules of policy she had said to
herself she would marry if he could be found. So Gwyn completes the
rhythm of her long journey only to return to that which is most
familiar to her, and to see it for the first time. She marries the
man of her dreams. In disciplining her to her own greatest good,
the Lord is Gwyn's friend. It is crucial of course that Gwyn see it
for herself. If teachers discipline their students in any other
way, then they have fallen short of realizing the best possibility
in the situation. Once we see our students' best possibility, we
have no choice. If we are free to do what we want, then the virtues
of the practice will demand that we do our best to help our
students see the possibilities for their <i>selves</i> and strive
to actualize them.</p>

<p>Freedom, I want to suggest, is the freedom to grow in healthy
relationship with others to the widest expanse we can obtain
without despair, and that we are most free when we are bound by the
greatest good that it is within our unique potential to obtain. We
are free if we can perceive the best possibility for ourselves and
others in any given situation, and if we act intelligently to
obtain it. Freedom is right action and the greatest weight to bear.
Teachers, especially language arts teachers, must have the
prophetic power to intelligently perceive a student's best
possibility and be willing to act poetically in a way that may
carry them beyond good and evil.</p>

<p><a href="#Experience">Dewey (1934, 1987)</a> concludes <a href=
"#Experience"><i>Art as Experience</i></a> by affirming the primacy
of the aesthetic encounter with these words from the poet
Browning:</p>

<p>But Art, wherein man speaks in no wise to man,</p>

<p>Only to mankind--Art may tell a truth</p>

<p>Obliquely, do the deed shall breed the thought.</p>

<p>The artifice of costume and theatrical masking are superficial
clues to the disclosive and transformative power of the poetic art
Gwyn took up, and the prophetic work <a href="#Voigt">Voigt</a> has
created. Good teachers must be both poets and prophets and go where
their calling demands.</p>
