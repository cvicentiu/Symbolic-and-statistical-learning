<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dead man's girly</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;font color=#CC0000&gt;She is the author of a large number of books which are usually considered &quot;young adult&quot;, but don't let that stop you from reading them!<br />
<br />
Her books inspired me to start writing. They're filled with wisdom and the characters are people you come to really care about. <br />
<br />
I can't say enough about the books Cynthia Voigt has written. From &lt;u&gt;Dicey's Song&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;Jackaroo&lt;/u&gt;, they have all managed to influence and guide me in some way. <br />
<br />
Anyone else out there read anything of hers? Any other fans out there?<br />
<br />
P.S. If you haven't read &lt;u&gt;A Solitary Blue&lt;/u&gt;, you MUST pick it up immediately. :)&lt;/font&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favorite quote from Dicey's Song: <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;&quot;You don't go reaching out with your hand closed up.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; - Abigail Tillerman<br />
<br />
Between the ages of 12-15, I managed to read all of her books and get my friend hooked on them too.  :e</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pelagia</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My 4th grade teacher read &lt;u&gt;Homecoming&lt;/u&gt; to us in class. It was awesome. I can't remember if she read &lt;u&gt;Dicey's Song&lt;/u&gt; to us also, or whether I read it on my own.<br />
<br />
Then I read &lt;u&gt;A Solitary Blue&lt;/u&gt;, which was also really good. And at some point, I also read &lt;u&gt;Izzy, Willy Nilly&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;u&gt;A Solitary Blue&lt;/u&gt; was my favorite of all of the books by her that I read.<br />
