Michele, Susie & Lisa<br>

<u>Some of Pam's Favorite 'Teen-Proven' Picks</u><br>
<br>

<font size="1">A sequel to <u>Jason's Gold</u> - a fun adventure that involves a kayak race entwined in an historical novel about the gold rush days in the Yukon.</font><br>
<b><u>Carolyn Meyer</u></b> - Carolyn Meyer is my favorite historical and periodic fiction writer. &nbsp; Her books are loaded with facts but not overly complicated with dates and super trivia of the times.<br>
<b>Where the broken heart still beats</b> by Carolyn Meyer<br>
<font size="1">A true story about Cynthia Anne Parker who was taken away from her family by Comanche Indians and raised with them. &nbsp; She learns to love their ways and has a terrific adjustment when she is once again returned to her 'white world' at the age of 34.</font><br>

<font size="1">After her father's death in 1547, thirteen year old Elizabeth must endure the political intrigues and dangers of the reigns of her half brother Edward and her half sister Mary before finally becoming queen of England eleven years later.</font><br>
<b><u>Richard Peck</u></b> - Mr. Peck has an incredible ability to speak 'teen'. &nbsp; His latest books are so humorous that there is no line drawn as to age level for entertainment. &nbsp; Everyone loves Richard Peck.<br>
<b>A year down yonder, A long way from Chicago</b> and <b>Fair Weather</b> by Richard Peck<br>
<font size="1">All follow the the down-home adventures of families in the late 1800s and early 1900s. &nbsp; They are written in an easy-to-read format. &nbsp; His chapters are short stories in themselves. &nbsp; They would make fantastic family reads.</font><br>

<u><b>Cynthia Voigt</b></u> - Ms. Voigt does interesting character development within her real life adventures. &nbsp; I recommend her titles to girls.<br>

<u><b>Gary Paulsen</b></u> - Paulsen's adventure and survival stories are so popular. &nbsp; He tells many of his stories around adventures that he has had both as a child and an adult. &nbsp; He is read by both young men and women with equal enthusiasm.<br>
<b>Sisters/Hermanas</b><br>
<font size="1">A uniquely told story about two teens. &nbsp; One, a wealthy, cheerleader type, the other a Mexican prostitute. &nbsp; Paulsen has written this story as a comparison, and how these girls dreams of their future intersect. &nbsp; He does very well writing in these female characters.</font><br>

<b><u>Robert Lipsyte</u></b> - Lipsyte was a sports reporter for the New York Times. &nbsp; He covered an Ali boxing match and was hooked. &nbsp; His Y.A. titles use strong minority youth as main characters. &nbsp; He is a favorite author of mine for what he doesn't say - he lets your mind fill in the story blanks. &nbsp; I recommend these to boys who 'don't like to read'.<br>
<b>The Contender, The Brave</b> and <b>The Chief</b><br>
<font size="1">These are about troubled youth who find their way into the boxing arena. &nbsp; They tell the stories about how these kids use their sport, are abused by their sport, and, in the end, how they see their futures. &nbsp; They are all just short enough to tell a good, long story.</font><br>

<b>Candidate for Murder</b><br>

<b>Playing for Keeps</b><br>
<font size="1">On a Caribbean cruise, Rosie meets a teenage Cuban baseball player seeking political asylum in the United States and tries to help him escape a charge of murder.</font><br>
<br>
