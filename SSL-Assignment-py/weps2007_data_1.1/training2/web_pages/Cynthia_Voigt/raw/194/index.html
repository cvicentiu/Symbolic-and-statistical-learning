        <p>This is a very good book. It is about a girl named Mikey who falls in lovewith the star of the 8th grade school play. Mikey has never felt this way before so she depends on her best friend, Margalo, to help her through this year. Mikey doesn't know what to do so she starts to smother Shawn with cookies and pushes through the crowd to get to him. Mikey soon learns that being in love doesn't mean changing your personality for a certain person,and she learns that the hard way. As you read this book you will fall inlove with the way that Cynthia Voigt gives each character their own voice.This is an awesome book that I would recommend for 6th through 8th graders. If you like this book as much as I did then you should check out more of          Cynthia Voigt's books such as, <u>It's Not Easy Being Bad</u>, <u>Homecoming</u>, and          <u>Dicey's Song</u>.</p>

        <p> My book, <u>Devils Night: And Other True Tales of Detroit</u>, is the best book I have ever read. It is told in third person narration, which makes the book seem like you are in the story. The author, Ze&#8217;ev Chafets, gives a very detailed story on how Detroit was in the past. He talks about the colors of burning houses and the way the smoke smelt. Like I said, it is a very good book! As soon as I read the first page of Devils Night, the author had me hooked, and that&#8217;s what I like in a book. What also makes the book fun is the author tells the story from when he&#8217;s 13 years old. I would recommend this book for people from the age of 13 to adults. </p>

She loved hanging out with her friends and talking about boys. She also loved to write in her new diary she got for her birthday. Unfortunately, all of that changed when she had to go into hiding because Adolf Hitler was a man who captured as many Jewish people as possible. Anne Frank was of Jewish descent. When Anne was in hiding, she wrote in her diary. This book was written as Anne Frank' s diary.

They let her live, but she is given a job that no one else in the community can accomplish. She then lives at a place where other people have special talents too.

But Harry was not perfectly normal at all, at least not by our standards. He was a Wizard, and attended a Wizard training school called Hogwarts. His parents had been Wizards as well and had been murdered by a powerful Dark Wizard called Voldemort. Harry lived with his aunt and uncle and their son. This made him severely mad because they were Muggles (non-magic folk) and because of his abnormalities they treated him like scum.</p>
        <p> Harry goes to his godfather's house after an infuriating summer and finds out about a group of Witches and Wizards fighting against Voldemort. Harry goes back to school after going to a trial for a false crime and not being convicted. There is a new teacher at his school that is reporting to the Ministry of Magic which is reporting to the public that Harry is lying about Voldemort's return to power. After telling the truth about the return of Voldemort in his new teacher's class, Harry has to bear a week's worth of cruel detentions. Harry has been having dreams about dark passageways and locked doors. In situations he can actually see what is happening at a certain time in the dreams. These dreams turn out to be both helpful and deadly.</p>

        <p>I truly enjoyed reading The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Ann Brashares. She is an outstanding author, and I would recommend the second book in this two-part series, The Second Summer of the Sisterhood. This is a story about four close friends who have spent every summer of their lives together! But now, they all have plans to be somewhere else over the summer, apart from each other. Lena flies to Greece to visit her grandparents, Bridget goes to Baja California, Mexico to attend a soccer camp, Carmen flies to South Carolina for a visit with her father, and Tibby stays home all summer. While on their separate vacations, each girl learns something about themselves. The girls keep in touch by writing, and by sending a magical pair of pants back and forth. You see, the day before they departed, Tibby found an old pair of pants stashed away in Carmen's bedroom, and asked if she could have them. Why did she want them, I do not know. When Carmen said yes; they were just some junky old jeans she had bought at a Thrift Store. Tibby decided to try them on. Tibby and Carmen were very different when it came to sizes, so no one expected the pants to fit Tibby&acute;s frail figure. When they (amazingly) did, all the other girls tried them on as well. When they saw that they fit everyone, the Pants were declared magical and that&acute;s how it all began. Anyway, this is a very bright, fun story. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. But mostly laugh. This book is paperback and 290 pages long, but the reading goes by very fast. If you enjoy books about love, friendship, and finding the true you, then you should read this book!!
