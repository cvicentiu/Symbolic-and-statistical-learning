    mother, her father, her older brother Nate, and her younger sister Diedre.&nbsp; Clothilde
    is only 8 years old when her father goes off to fight in WWI.&nbsp; As a result of her
    fatehr's enlistment, the family is forced to move from the grandfather's palatial estate
    to a small cottage on the coast of Maine.&nbsp; This land in Maine had been given to
    Clothilde by her grandfather's ill-liked sister when Clothilde was only a toddler.&nbsp; <em>Tree
    by Leaf</em> depicts Clothilde's growth and development from age 3 until she becomes a
    famous psychotherapist and mother as an adult.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp; <strong>Plot </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">After moving to Maine, Clothilde is saddled with many domestic
    chores.&nbsp; Sometimes she feels that no one seems to care about her future and
    education.&nbsp; She thinks that she is considered more of a servant than Lou, their hired
    servant girl.&nbsp; Times are hard for the family.&nbsp; Nate goes away to school, later
    choosing to live with the imperious grandfather rather than his immediate family.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">As an imaginative, curious child Clothilde often ponders that if she
    were God, she'd run the world differently!&nbsp; She loves the sea, the peninsula, the
    trees and revels in their beauty and mystery.&nbsp; On one of her forays across the
    peninsula, Clothilde hears a strange voice and she makes three requests of it. &nbsp;
    Later, still confused by the voice, she questions the wisdom of her earlier wishes and
    experiences feelings of guilt when some of her wishes are coming true.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Meanwhile, Clothilde's father returns to Maine, terribly disfigured
    by his war injuries, becoming an apparition seeking refuge in the boathouse away from the
    eyes of his loved ones.&nbsp; After a few years of estrangement, Clothilde discovers her
    father is a talented artist.&nbsp; Eventually, the walls between them come tumbling down
    and they come to love, understand and accept each other.&nbsp; The father returns to live
    in the house.&nbsp; He achieves recognition as a world-famous watercolorist.&nbsp; He is
    reunited with his family and friends.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The novel depicts Clothilde's growth from age 3 until she becomes a
    psychotherapist, mother, and the owner of the mitten-shaped peninsula that she loves.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">8. <strong>Evaluation</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">As a historical novel, <em>Tree by Leaf</em> gives a glimpse of what
    family life was like in Maine in the 1920s.&nbsp; Clothilde, the heroine, is an
    interesting little character with her reverence for nature and her love/hate relationships
    with her family and the girls at school.&nbsp; Her human foibles only make her more ture
    to life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Because of the unsolved mystery of the Voice, students will either
    like or strongly dislike the book.&nbsp; Because of the ambiguity of the persona of the
    Voice, some may find the novel appealing in the same manner that readers responded to <em>The
    Lady or the Tiger,</em> a short story written by Frank Stockton.&nbsp; In that classic
    story the reader determined for himself the outcome of the story.&nbsp; The reader of <em>Tree
    by Leaf</em> defines the identity of the Voice for himself/herself.&nbsp; </font></p>
