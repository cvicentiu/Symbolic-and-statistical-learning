My writing is my way of saying, 'Have you looked at this way?" <P><CENTER>Voigt's young-adult novels range from fantasy-romance to her latest and most controversial book, <U>When She Hollers</U>, a gritty story of sexual abuse.</CENTER> </b>

<H3>Her Life:</H3>Voigt was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Connecticut.  For many years, she lived in Maryland and taught school, and now she lives in Maine.  She loves to write.  She says that she begins a book with a character and a slight plot, and after that, she begins to see the theme.  
 “It's a razzle-dazzle kind of fun to have a story come out and do well.  That's wonderful.  But it's only when you're up there working when it's actually real: that's what the whole thing is rooted in, and that's the only thing that actually counts.”
<P><IMG SRC="voigt3.jpg"  ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="100 WIDTH="100">

Voigt was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the second of her parents' five children. Most of her childhood was spent in small-town southern Connecticut. It was in this atmosphere that Voigt began to develop an interest in books. She once recalled: "My grandmother lived in northern Connecticut, in a house three stories high; its corridors lined with bookcases." Voigt noted that she had already become an avid reader, with books such as "Nancy Drew, Cherry Ames, The Black Stallion, and the Terhune book(s)," when one day at her grandmother's house she "pulled <U>The Secret Garden</U> off one of her shelves and read it. "This was the first book I found entirely for myself, and I cherished it."
<P>
"There weren't any so-called 'young adult' books when I was growing up.  I started to read adult books, with my mother making sure what I had chosen was not 'too adult.' I read Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Camus, and many classics."
<IMG SRC="voigt1.jpg"  ALIGN="left" HEIGHT="200 WIDTH="180">

<P> By the time Voigt began high school, she had set her sights on a career as a writer. She began writing short stories and poetry, and while at Smith College, she enrolled in creative writing courses. After graduation from Smith College, Voigt moved to New York City where she worked for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. 
<P>
In 1964, she moved with her first husband to Santa Fe, New Mexico; though she had never planned to become a teacher, this was the work that was available and, as she once noted, "the minute I walked into a classroom, I loved it."
<P><IMG SRC="voigt5.jpg"  ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="100 WIDTH="100">
By the time of her divorce from her first husband, Voigt had settled in Annapolis, Maryland and eventually took a job at the Key School there. Though she had not written much during her first marriage, her literary interests were rekindled at the Key School. As she once explained, "I was assigned to teach English in second, fifth and seventh grades. The second graders were a kick and a half. I assigned book reports to my fifth graders. I would go to the library and starting with the letter 'A' peruse books at the fifth, sixth, and seventh-grade age level. If a book looked interesting, I checked it out. I once went home with thirty books! It was then that I realized one could tell stories which had the shape of real books--novels--for kids the age of my students.

The story takes her from age 10 to 15, following her from a youthful dancer, full of herself and her ambitions, to a wise and realistic young woman. The key to her growth is Tamer Shipp, a young pastor who drives her home from the station once she leaves the dance camp from which she has been dismissed, perhaps because puberty has harmed her talents, perhaps because she is black. When Tamer's honesty and understanding help her through the first pain, she begins to love him, forming a relationship which will be central to her perceptions of the world around her for the ensuing three summers
