The trouble is, typical, normal kids are what work in junior high, and if there's one thing Mikey and Margalo aren't, it's typical and normal.  Mikey's first attempt to crack seventh grade society ends, predictably, in disaster, but, undaunted, the friends persevere. They've got the will, they've got the smarts, and most importantly, they've got each other. What chance does junior high have against the Bad Girls?</font></td>

    <b><img border="0" src="images/bg4.gif" align="left" width="81" height="125"></b>Shawn Macavity. While this name may mean nothing to you, it means a lot to Mikey Elsinger. That's the name of a guy who's unbelievably cool and handsome, not to mention the star of the eighth-grade play, and Mikey wants him to notice her. While Mikey goes after Shawn full-force, like the bad girl she is, her best friend and co-bad girl, Margalo Epps, hides a secret crush on her teacher. With the school dance fast approaching and life growing increasingly complicated, will Mikey and Margalo ever figure out that funny thing called love? in this fourth book in her acclaimed Bad GIrl series, Newbery Award winner Cynthia Voigt tackles the ultimate experience: falling in love (sort of) for the first
    time.</font>
