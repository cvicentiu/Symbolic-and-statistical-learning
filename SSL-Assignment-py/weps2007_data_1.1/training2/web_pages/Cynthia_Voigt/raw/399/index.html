<TR> <A HREF="moct.html">October 3rd</A> is the birthday of English veterinarian and author James Herriot, born James Alfred Wight in Sunderland, England (1916). His two works were published together in the United States as All Creatures Great and Small (1972). The book became a bestseller, and Herriot became a famous author. <P>
 Growing up, he never wanted to be anything other than a veterinarian. After going to school in Glasgow he dreamed of having a cutting-edge and flashy practice. He instead wound up, in his own words, "sitting on a high Yorkshire moor in shirt sleeves and Wellingtons, smelling vaguely of cows." But he fell in love with Yorkshire and the challenging life of a country veterinarian. After over twenty-five years as a veterinarian, Herriot started writing. He said he wanted to tell people what it was like to be an animal doctor before penicillin and modern medicine, and also about all of the people and funny events that he met on his daily rounds. It took him a long time to decide to finally write down his stories. In the end, his wife challenged him. He was telling her about his day, and said that he would put part of it in his book. She said to him, "Jim, you are never going to write a book." She reminded him that he had been talking about it for twenty-five years and had never written anything. He protested. She replied that old vets don't just suddenly write books. Herriot said, "That did it. I went straight out, bought a lot of paper and got down to the job." His first book was If Only They Could Talk (1970). It took him four years to get it published. The publishers only made 1200 copies, and it was not a success. He thought that this would be his only book. But he still had more stories to tell, and so he wrote another book, It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet (1972). He suddenly became successful when these two works were published together in the United States as All Creatures Great and Small (1972). The book became a bestseller, and Herriot became a famous author.

<A HREF="moct.html">October 8th</A> is the birthday of <A HREF="http://www.scholastic.com/goosebumps/books/stine/">R(obert) L(awrence) Stine</A>, born in Columbus, Ohio (1943). He wrote a series called Fear Street and then launched the more popular Goosebumps book series in 1992-scary tales aimed at eight- to eleven-year-olds. The books in the series have names like Say Cheese and Die! (1992), The Cuckoo Clock of Doom (1995), and The Horror at Camp Jellyjam (1995). As a child he spent hours alone, was always picked last for the team and often got lost in an imaginary world. He wrote stories though, typing them with one finger, as he still does. He typed out jokes and stories and handed them out at school, even though his teacher kept confiscating them. He was inspired by horror comic strips like Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror. He read them every Saturday at the barbershop, when he got his weekly hair cut. His most recent book is The Sitter (2003), about a haunted babysitting experience.<P></TD>

It's the birthday of the woman who wrote about the adventures of a girl named Pippi Långstrump, or, as we know her in English, Pippi Longstocking: Swedish author <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~mfj/astrid.lindgren.html">Astrid Lindgren</A>, was born Astrid Ericsson on a farm near Vimmerby, Sweden (1907). One day in 1944, Lindgren sprained her ankle, and while she was stuck in bed she wrote down the Pippi Longstocking stories she'd been telling her children for years. She wanted to give a copy to her daughter Karin for her tenth birthday. Astrid Lindgren was so happy with her work that she sent it to a publisher, and in 1945, Pippi Longstocking was published. Pippi is a nine-year-old girl with no parents who lives in a red house at the edge of a Swedish village with her horse and her pet monkey, Mr. Nilsson. She has red pigtails, and she wears one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. She eats whole chocolate cakes and sleeps with her feet on the pillow, and she's the strongest girl in the world. The sequels to Pippi Longstocking include Pippi Goes on Board (1946) and Pippi in the South Seas (1948). Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books are her most popular, but she wrote more than 115 others, including detective stories, adventure stories, fantasy novels, and realistic fiction. Her books have sold 80 million copies and have been translated into Arabic, Armenian, Vietnamese, and Zulu. Lindgren died last year in Stockholm. She was 94. When she was asked what she wanted for her 94th birthday, she said, "Peace on earth and nice clothes

 February's Author of the Month is Cynthia Voigt. Voigt was born on <br>
      February 25, 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts as Cynthia Irving. Voigt first decided to become a writer when she was in high school because she liked books. When she was teaching, she decided to write books for young adults. She wrote short stories and poetry in high school and college. She attended Smith College. She worked as a secretary and as a teacher before beginning her writing career in 1981. According to Ms Voigt, & quot;I enjoy almost everything I do, perhaps because when I don't enjoy something, I don't do it.& quot; She has written many books and short stories, all with well-developed characters, interesting plots and authentic atmosphere. </font></p>
      <p>Cynthia has won many awards for her children's and young
      adult books. Among these awards were the Newbery Medal for Dicey's Song and, in 1990, the
      California Young Reader's Award for Izzy, Willy Nilly. Most recently, the versatile author
      turned to a more gritty, realistic choice of<br>
      subject matter in When She Hollers, a riveting novel about a teenager who decides to
      defend herself against her stepfather's abuse. <br></TD></CENTER>
