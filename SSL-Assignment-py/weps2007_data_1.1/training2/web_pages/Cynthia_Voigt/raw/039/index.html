			  Mikey and Margalo are friends. They both have the same initials --- ME ---
and they've been best friends since fifth grade. Now they're in seventh
grade, and all they've got is each other. Because nobody else likes them.
Junior high sucks that way. <P>

Mikey wonders what's wrong with her. Margalo could tell her, but she knows
that nobody really wants you to answer them when they ask you what's wrong
with them. Besides, she doesn't think there's anything wrong with Mikey.
Mikey is just Mikey. Just bossy, don't-back-down, never-listen-to-anybody
Mikey. She just doesn't fit in with the way everybody else is. But Margalo is
different from Mikey --- Margalo could fit in with the other kids. She's good
at reading people. She knows which teachers want you to raise your hand and
ask questions, and which teachers want you to just listen up. She knows how
to talk to people so they think you're just like they are. She could become
popular. But does she want to? Not really. She and Mikey just want to not be
unpopular.  <P>

Well, Mikey works at this problem in her usual way. She comes up with a plan
she thinks is brilliant, and she doesn't listen when Margalo tries to tell
her it's not so brilliant. She plans a Halloween dinner party. She thinks up
a really good menu she'll fix herself. Margalo can't come to the party
because she has to baby-sit at home, but Mikey gets her to help clean house
and she gets her dad to act as serving chef. Mikey sends out dinner
invitations that she makes up on her computer. And she asks for RSVP, Regrets
Only. Then she waits for people to show up. But nobody does. And they don't
even send regrets. They just all decided not to come, and to laugh at Mikey
when she goes back to school.  <P>

Mikey and Margalo plan to get even with everybody who blew off the party, but
that blows up in their faces, too. Mikey becomes a regular in the principal's
office. Mikey decides, after the party disaster, that she'll just put in her
time at junior high and not worry about being popular anymore. Can Margalo do
this? She doesn't want people to dislike her the way they do Mikey. Will kids
want to hang out with her as long as she's friends with Mikey? Just how far
will Margalo go to be popular? And Margalo knows there are lots of things to
admire and even envy about Mikey. Sometimes she wishes she could be more like
her. How will these two girls work things out for themselves? You will learn
a lot about being popular --- and unpopular --- and which might be worse, if
you read this book.
