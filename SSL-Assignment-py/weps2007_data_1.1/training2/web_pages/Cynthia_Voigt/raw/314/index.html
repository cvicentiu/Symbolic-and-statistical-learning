One of my favorite books that I read this year is, Izzy, Willy-Nilly.  The
reason is, I loved the story, characters, and moral.  It was sad and a little
upsetting, but it was still wonderful.  It was written very well and thought
out wonderfully. <BR>
Izzy, Willy-Nilly, is about a young girl who's life totally changes after
a car accident with a drunk driver.  She has to have half her left leg removed,
do to the accident.  The author, Cynthia Voigt, does a great job showing
the reaction of family and friends and their change in behavior.  But Izzy,
discards this and seeks comfort and friendship with a girl named Rosamunde.
 Rosamunde, being called ugly and a little over weight, can understand how
Izzy feels, for everyone has always treated Rosamunde as though she does
not belong because of her appearance.  They all think she is weird.  And
Izzy does at first too, but she learns that she is the only friend she has
that understands her pain.  Together they learn how to make people not feel
sorry for them, but instead look up to them,  It is a wonderful story, showing
how cruel people can and will be if your outside changes, even if your still
the same inside. <BR>
