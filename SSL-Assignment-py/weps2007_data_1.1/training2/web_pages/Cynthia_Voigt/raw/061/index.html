<p><strong>Autobiographical Statement</strong></p>
<p>I like to think of myself as a New Englander even though that's not strictly true. The true part is based on facts: I was born in Boston, raised in Connecticut, educated in Massachusetts. The not-strictly part is also based on facts: I live in Maryland, while real New Englanders live in Maine--I have never even been to Maine; real New Englanders are taciturn types who seem pretty clear about what they think--I am talky a lot of the time (although I do have a taste for silence and solitude) and am never as sure of things as I would like to be. </p>

<p>In my life, I have three jobs, all of which I like. I have the job of wife-and-mother, where you build relationships that you hope will last all your life long. I have the job of teacher, where you think about really substantial books, like Hamlet, and think also about who the students are and how they can make themselves better at being what they are. I have the job of writer, which is one of the world's strangest occupations, full of contradictions, intensely interesting. </p>

<p>I always wanted to be a writer, always from the age of twelve. Even earlier than that, I always was a reader. I love a good story, and I love to meet interesting characters, and I like thinking. I discovered children's literature not when I was a child but when I first taught fifth grade. I wanted my students to write book reports so I went to the library to make up a list of books for them to read. I started with the letter A and read my way through to Z, Alexander to Zindel. As a reader, I was delighted and excited. As a writer, it was as if somebody had opened a window for me, to show me a whole new landscape. </p>

<p>That is the inner biography. The outer biography runs parallel: I went to Dana Hall School, Smith College, and then, for education courses, to St. Michael's College in Santa Fe--while I didn't always like being at school I did always enjoy learning; I have had a number of jobs, in my early employment years, child-care, waitress, secretary; once I discovered teaching, that has been my favorite employment and I have taught every grade from second through twelfth (except for third, I've never taught third graders) as well as doing tutoring in remedial reading. I have been a single woman, a divorced woman head-of-household, a married woman--and there are good and bad things about all of those states, as far as I can tell, although on the whole I prefer marriage. My husband is a teacher of the classics, Greek, Latin, Ancient History. We have two children, Jessica who is twelve and Peter who is five. We live in Annapolis during the school year and go off to the Eastern Shore for the summers, to get away and to be by the water. We all like being by the water, to swim in or paddle around, to travel over and pull crabs out of, to have it nearby and watch the way the tides rise and fall, the way the colors on it change. </p>

<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>Cynthia Voigt was born in Boston in 1942 and raised in Connecticut. She attended Smith College, where she received a B.A. in 1963. For many years, Voigt worked as a high school English teacher and department chair at the Key School in Maryland. She now makes her home in Deer Isle, Maine. </p>

<p>Since 1981, Voigt has been producing beautifully written novels for middle schoolers and young adults with complex plots and character studies. She has thoughtfully addressed a number of serious issues related to children and growing up, including child abuse and neglect, emotional abandonment, and racism. Her books are favorites with young adults readers and librarians and frequently appear on school reading lists. Voigt's book are generally long but their stories are compelling; readers are carried through to the end of each book by their concern for realistic and sympathetic characters. </p>

<p>Voigt's stories about the Tillerman family and extended family include Homecoming which was nominated for an American Book Award in 1982. Its sequel, Dicey's Song, won the 1983 Newbery Award. Homecoming concern an enterprising thirteen-year-old, Dicey, who must keep her younger siblings together after their emotionally disturbed mother, and only parent, abandons them. In Dicey's Song, the family has moved to their grandmother's home in Maryland and must establish a relationship with their grandmother and new surroundings. A friend of Dicey Tillerman, Jeff, is the main character of A Solitary Blue. Jeff is a boy who lives alone with his father, a professor who pays little attention to him. Jeff's life is deeply affected when his mother, who has long ago abandoned him, suddenly reappears in his life and contributes further tension to his relationship with his father. </p>

<p>Voigt's books for younger adolescents include Building Blocks, a time travel story, and a mystery about a stolen Egyptian artifact, The Vandemark Mummy. The story is entertaining and exciting, somewhat of a departure from the thoughtful character studies of her books for older readers. TXT=Voigt has been recognized for her important contribution to contemporary literature for young adults. Dicey's Song was a Newbery Medal winner in 1983, A Solitary Blue was a Newbery Honor Book runner-up in 1984, and The Callendar Papers an Edgar Allan Poe Award winner in 1984. Voigt also received the Alan Award for achievement in young adult literature in 1989 and the California Young Reader's Award in 1990 for Izzy, Willy-Nilly. </p>
