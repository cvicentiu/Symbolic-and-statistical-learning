  ISAAC F. HUNTER <br>
  <br>
  ISAAC HUNTER, believed to be the son of Jacob, was born in Robertson County,
  Tennessee, on Sept. 14, 1798. He lived at Whites Creek, Davidson Co.,
  Tennessee, for nearly his entire life. The first entry of an Isaac Hunter
  buying land was recorded Aug. 22, 1831 at Whites Creek. He bought several
  tracts in the same vicinity during his lifetime. He is listed on the Davidson
  County census in 1830, 1840, 1850, 1860, and 1870. <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Hunter married Mary Marshall (daughter of James Marshall and Margaret
  Wilson) in Davidson County, April 17, 1823. She was born Jan. 13, 1803 and
  died Jan. 2, 1839, both in Davidson County. She is buried in the Marshall
  Cemetery on White's Creek. Isaac and Mary were the parents of five children:
  Mary Adeline, Gilbert Marshall, James Marshall, Margaret Jane, and Elizabeth
  Ann. <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Hunter married Mary Reding (daughter of Maximillian Reding and Mary
  &quot;Polly&quot; Love) on Oct. 29, 1839. She died Feb. 18, 1846. They had
  four children William Robert, Joseph Love, Isaac Christopher, and Nancy C. <br>
  <br>
  In 1845 he was named a co-executor of his brother Matthew Ryburn Hunters'
  will. <br>
  <br>
  By the mid-1840's, his eldest son, Gilbert Marshall, had moved to Texas,
  marrying there in 1847. He second oldest son, James Marshall, married in 1847
  and moved to Williamson County, Tennessee. Two of his daughters from his
  first marriage, Mary Adeline and Margaret Jane, were married on the same day
  in 1846; the first settled in Lincoln County, Tennessee, and the second in
  Graves County, Kentucky. <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Hunter married his third wife, C. Ellen Davenport, on September 3,
  1849, in Davidson County. Ellen or Eleanor had a daughter from a prior
  marriage, Elizabeth Davenport, born in 1840. Isaac and Eleanor had one child
  named Laura Watson. <br>
  <br>
  In 1852, his last daughter from his first marriage, Elizabeth Ann, married.
  About 1857, two of his sons, William Robert and Joseph Love, left home to
  join their half-brother Gilbert Marshall, in Robertson County, Texas. By 1860
  only Isaac Christopher, Nancy C., and Laura Watson were still at home. <br>
  <br>
  In June, 1862, he lost his first son, William Robert, who was killed in the
  battle of Cold Harbor, in Virginia. In February, 1863, he lost another son,
  James Marshall, at Fort Donelson. In April 1863, another son, Gilbert
  Marshall Hunter, died of illness in Robertson County, Texas. A fourth son,
  Isaac Christopher also died in the war. After the war, only one son, Joseph
  Love, survived. <br>
  <br>
  In 1865, his daughter Nancy C. married and left home. By 1870, his daughter
  Elizabeth Ann had returned, presumably after her husband died, with a
  daughter, Ida. Laura Watson remained at home. <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Hunter died Jan. 12, 1872. A will made by him has not been found, but
  the following was found in a Deed Book in Davidson County, recorded September
  15, 1870: <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I, Isaac F. Hunter, of the County of Davidson, in the State of
  Tennessee for and in consideration of the love and affection I have for my
  wife, Elener Hunter, and for one dollar to me paid, have this day bargained
  and sold and I do hereby give, transfer and convey to the said Elener Hunter
  as here in after stated, a tract of land in the county and State aforesaid on
  the north side of Cumberland River. (Description of the tract) containing
  according to survey of B. F. Woodward, of this day 66 acres and being a part
  of my home tract and including my residence. To have and to hold to the said
  Elener Hunter for her sole and separate use for and during her natural life,
  with remainder to my daughter Laura Watson Hunter, her heirs and provided
  that if my said daughter should die without issue before the death of my said
  wife, then and in that event said land to ? to me ? my lawful ? after the
  death of my said wife, and I agree and bind myself, my heirs, and to warrant
  and defend of the. title of said land as above conveyed against the, lawful
  claims of all persons whatever. Witness my hand and seal Sept. 23, 1865. <br>
  <br>
  Isaac F. Hunter (seal) <br>
  <br>
  2nd I also give, transfer and convey to my wife, Elener Hunter, one tract or
  parcel of land on the Ridge and on the head waters of Sycamore creek and
  joining the land of Mr. Green on the north and granted by the State of
  Tennessee to Francis McRay, containing one hundred acres by survey, 3rd I
  also give her one small peace or parcel of land, say twelve acres., more or
  less, joining the piece of land I sold to Mr. Green on the south, running to
  the top of the ridge and then with the ridge north to Green's corner on the
  top of the ridge. 4th I also give to my wife all the stock of all kind that
  may be on the place when I die. Also all the farming tools and all the
  household and kitchen furniture that may be on the place or premises. Witness
  my hand and seal this March 23, 1867.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Isaac F., Hunter (Seal) <br>
  <br>
  The death of his wife, Elener, or daughter, Laura, is not known. The burial
  place of Isaac or his last two wives is not currently known, but it is
  thought to be near White's Creek in Davidson County, Tennessee. <br>
