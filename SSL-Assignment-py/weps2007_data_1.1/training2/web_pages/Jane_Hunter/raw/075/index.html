<br>
 My Name Is JENNIEL NEILEN nee BAIRD, from Beerwah, Sunshine Coast Hinterland, Queensland, Australia.
about 1 hour North of Brisbane.<br>
<br>
 My link to the BAIRD'S is 4 generations the line starts from
 my father KEVIN LESLIE BAIRD b 8.2.48  m - JENNIFER MACKENZIE
my poppy ADAM JOHN "JACK" BAIRD b 30.6.1906 - d 14.9.1974 MELVIA JULIA KLEMM
 then ADAM BAIRD b 1862 - d 5.7.1946 m - ISABELLA PROCTOR
 then ADAM BAIRD b 1831 Scotland - d ? m - MARGARET POLSON.<br>
<br>
 This is where the BAIRD book has finished.
 
 ROBERT & JUDY FLOREY completed their research of the 
 BAIRD'S in Australia in April 1997.  But the last link is a bit vague. I would 
 like to find any infomation that could help me.<br>
<br>

NORMA,  I just dropped into your site its very interesting.  I have also found Irish BAIRD'S who were convicts to Australia.

I would like to ask if my web site could have a link on your site, and I will return the favour by adding your link to my site it is called
BAIRD History and Genealogy
at http://www.bairdnet.com<br><br>

I have about 60 pages from births, marriages, wedding banns from Scottish archives also immigration list to Australia, many family trees and heaps more, its designed so other BAIRD'S can do their own research using the resources.<br><br>

I will be doing a large Australian BAIRD section, but I don't have very may links to US which would be great.<br><br>
