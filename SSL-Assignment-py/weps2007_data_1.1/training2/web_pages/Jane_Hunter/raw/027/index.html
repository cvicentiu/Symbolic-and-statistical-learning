<p id="newsfeaturehd">Republican electoral defeat leaves religious right largely intact
<p class="pubdetails" id="newsfeature">By JewsOnFirst.org, November 20, 2006

<p id="newsfeaturep">The Republican defeat was hardly an unmitigated disaster for the religious right. Christian nationalists will continue to pose an extreme danger to the First Amendment's guarantees regarding religion.

<p id="newsfeaturep">Right-wing Christians control many of the state Republican parties and dominate state Republican legislative majorities. Given the loss of opportunity on the federal level, there will probably be more, not fewer, state legislative attacks on science, gay rights and reproductive rights. Additionally, there will probably be an increase in state legislation deliberately breaching the separation of church and state in school and public life. <a href="http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06d/election06_analysis.html">Continue</a>.

<p id="newsfeaturehd"><img src="update.gif" align=left>Complaint to IRS on churches named in Kansas Attorney General's memo as campaign operations.
<p id="newsfeaturep"><b>October 27, 2006.</b> The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service alleging that two churches named in Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline's strategy memo (posted <a href="http://www.jewsonfirst.org/kline_memo.pdf" target=_blank>here</a> last month) are engaging in partisan political activity in violation of their tax exempt status.

<p id="newsfeaturehd">Kansas Attorney General writes orders for a reelection campaign operation "in each church"
<p id="newsfeaturehd"><i>Memo shows Republican Phill Kline's detailed plan for a church-based political machine</i>
<p class="pubdetails" id="newsfeature">by JewsOnFirst.org, September 17, 2006
<p id="newsfeaturep">In a tough battle for reelection, Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline gave his campaign staff detailed instructions on how to use churches to raise funds, recruit campaign volunteers and collect voter contact information. He wrote the instructions in a memo obtained by news organizations and <I>JewsOnFirst.org</I>.
<p id="newsfeaturep">Kline writes that the "goal" of receptions, which his staff will organize to dovetail with church services, "is to walk away with contact information, money and volunteers and a committee in each church." He names three of the churches already involved in his campaign.
<p id="newsfeaturep">Kline's August 8th memo lays bare for the world (including Democratic Party leaders who might care to protest) the details of how at least one Republican on the religious right uses churches for electoral operations. There is no reason to assume that Kline just created this campaign model. <a href="http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06c/kline_memo.html">Continue</a>.
