Earliest record of John Mills in America is a grant of 400acres of alnd dated March 1, 1743 on Persimmon Run, later known asLapsley's Run, in what is now Botetourct County, virginia. By 1748 hewas living on the Roanoke River in what is now Roanoke County, virginiasouth of Botetourt County. He seemingly was involved in a number of landdealings and ofter changed residences. He was Justice of Augusta County,Virginia in 1756 and played an important role in building up the town ofBuchanan, Virginia His first wife was Anne or Agnes, maiden name unknown,second wife Mary Gilchrist, to whom he was married by of before 1773.John Mills, Sr. had at least three childrenwho lived to attain adulthood,John Mills, Jr., who married Martha Ewing; Jane Mills who married JohnBell; and another daughter, name unknown, who married William Beard.Anne/Agnes Mills was the mother of these three children.

I have seen him recorded with Sarah Beals on the Internet at ever so many sites, and I don't know where that information came from unless someone picked up the wrong wife for John Mills, Sr. and sent this incorrect information in to be recorded ona WFT, and others picked up the erroneous information and it snow balled from there.<br><br><br>Marriage 2 Annie Mills <br>Married: BEF. 1750<br>Children <br> John Mills , Jr. Capt.  b: 6 Mar 1749/1750 in Augusta County, Virginia <br> Jane Millsb: ABT. 1762 in Augusta County, Virginia<br></p>

I have done all of my own research (the old fashioned way since old habits are hard to kick!) in regard to the Ewings and my information basically comes from records found in "The Ewing Genealogy with Cognate Brenches", from records I have found in various history books and from a few obituaries furnished by Ewing descendants or obits from historical societies, obits in connection with later generations of the family, that is. That isn't too say the records are without error, but they are as close as I can get to the actual facts with the material there is out there to work with. So many of the Ewing men were prominent politicians, attorneys, etc., that there has been a lot written about them in the early history of our nation, but finding information about the women in the family is a whole different ballgame. The women present a real challenge and I hope to learn more about some of them in the future".<br><br>Robert Ewing, the emigrant ancestor was born at or near coleraine, in Londonderry County, Ireland and came to America with his older brother, Charles Ewing, about the period 1735-1737.

Located in the community of Henry, Virginia, it is situated on partof a tract of land originally consisting of approximately 4,400 acresacquired around 1750 and a decade or so thereafter by the pioneerShadrack Turner (ca.<br>1730-1783) and his wife Anne. A Royal Land Grant, from King George, II ofEngland (reigned 1727-1768), this portion has remained in thedescendants' possession continuously since then, now almost two and ahalf centuries, including the present owner, Dr. Harry Lee King, Jr., ofthe eighth generation.<br><br>Some of the early tract dates from 1781, a grant from the newly formedCommonwealth of Virginia to Josiah Turner, I, (born ca. 1751), forservice in the American Revolution. The original document, bearing ahandsome red seal and signed by President Thomas Jefferson (when Governorof Virginia), is<br>still in the possession of the King family.It is believed that thepresent house was built by one of Shadrack Turner's sons who latermigrated West or moved to a nearby county.<br><br>Constructed of thirty-foot-long, hand-hewn oak logs, from twelve tofifteen inches wide, with two stairways and nine-foot ceilings, the mainpart of the structure once had a A-roof front porch, a long dinning roomat the rear with another porch running its length to which was joined abreezeway and a spacious log-bodied kitchen. All the exterior was coveredwith white-painted clapboard and accented with green window shutters.Interestingly, among the many outbuildings (only the smokehouse remains),the smoke-house, corncrib and chicken house, identical log buildingsresembling the kitchen and located near the dwelling, all boasted thesame carefully crafted decorative moldings as the main house and thecorncrib had a basement. The sitting-room mantel revealed an interestingfeature: upon its being removed recently the top back panel was found toconceal the family's "safe", a hollowed-out log<br>in which money and valuables could be secreted.Historic associationsabound when one thinks back upon "Kings Grant".<br><br>William Turner (1753-1845), of the second generation, and his wife, JaneHunter (1759-1851), donated eight acres of land for Town Creek Church,constituted in 1775, one of Virginia's oldest Baptist congregations. Hisson, Captain George W. Turner (1776-1854), whose wife was Mildred Stone,<br>(1780-1854), of Henry County, was an officer in the War of 1812, as weretwo of his brothers; he later served as Sheriff of Franklin County, Sixof the brothers were Justices of the Peace ; two were Baptistministers.Although owning slaves, but known for their merciful treatmentof their servants, the family attempted to mitigate the rigors of thesystem. Remarkable in the social framework of the epoch, their willscarefully stipulated "my servants are to be purchased by me legateesonly", with one further enjoining the executors "suffer them not to besold otherwise".<br><br>Kings Grant's most stirring, momentous two days occurred in April 1865,just as the doomed Confederacy was drawing its dying breaths with GeneralRobert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House: Stoneman's raid!Swarms of blue-clad Federal troops under command of General GeorgeStoneman, units largely of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and the 10thMichigan Cavalry, suddenly appeared and spread out over the premises andsurrounding territory. Enroute from Salem, Virginia to North Carolina,burning and looting, the soldiers came one day and left the next, buttheir searches, confiscations and depredations were so thorough as toproduce shock and dismay to last a lifetime and beyond. One eyewitnesssaid, "The house hill was blue with Yankee uniforms; they stoleeverything!" Another said, "The reason they stayed overnight is they hadthree or four badly wounded soldiers, laid out in the front yard, withthe ladies of the house and the servants helping attend them." One storywas the troops were bushwhacked near Bedford; another was they werebushwhacked at Ferrum, instead. I vote for Ferrum! Still another, "Thelast soldier to leave paused in the yard, looked back through<br>the kitchen door and spied something hey hadn't stolen; a fox hide tackedto the wall! So, he came back, took the hide and rode slowly off down theroad toward Martinsville." Thus Stoneman's raid ended for the HenryCommunity.<br><br>Of recent generation, those who have resided the longest at the houseare: Stephen Turner (1806-1884), of the Civil War Period, and his wifeRuth (Prillaman) Turner (1813-1884); their daughter Martha Jane (Turner)Turner (1852-1935) and her husband James Alexander ("Cap") Turner. Theirdescendants<br>although scattered geographically, still visit the area."Kings Grant",(or the Old Turner Place), after some recent restoration, continues itsdignified existence . One prays that the Civil War's tumult andindescribable loss will never be repeated; rather, as the old house andthe Henry Community embark on their third century, one earnestly praysthat the many happy days that both have enjoyed will follow<br>one another in unending succession.<br>Submitted by: Dr. Harry Lee King, Jr.........from DeCody Brad Marble<br><br>1.

<p style="margin-left:0.5in">General Notes: Robert’s father John Ewing was born in Londonderry about 1690 and had died in the first days of the trip to Virginia in 1741. Robert and his brother Charles had grown up fast on the edge of the wilderness. They buried their father near Lancaster Pennsylvania and turned the families west again. Their grandfather Charles Ewing had come to Ireland from Scotland in 1692 leaving his father John buried in home soil of Kilmore, Scotland. Grandpa Charles had died before Robert was born, and was buried in Ireland. After arriving in the area of the Peaks of Otter in 1753 Robert had written the Governor of Virginia with attachments and references given by his father-in-law and soon was qualified as a Justice for Bedford by King George II. Robert’s father-in-law was a native of Massachusetts who had settled first in Pennsylvania and then moved on with Robert and Charles to Amelia County in Virginia. His father and Grandfather were original settlers of the Massachusetts Colony, natives of England. Robert had taken a "preaching" job and moved on to the foothills in 1753 to the foot of the Peaks of Otter.<br>Findley Ewing <br>Surname: Ewing <br>Given Name: Findley <br>Sex: M <br>Birth: 7 Sep 1691 in Stirling, Scottland <br>Death: Jun 1787 in Peaks of Otter, Bedford, Virginia <br>Note: <br>-Captain Findley (Finley/Ffinlay) Ewing, (born about 650) father ofThomas Ewing Sr. was awarded a silver sword by his sovereign King Williamin recognition of his bravery during the battle. It is not known whatact of valor for which he was honored. But, the sword presented wassilver-handled and was in possession of the family in New Jersey when itwas stolen by a slave and the handle was melted for its metal. Beforeits theft, it war worn during the American Revolution by Dr. ThomasEwing, an army surgeon and great grandson of its original owner. FindleyEwing was a staunch Presbyterian and an ardent advocate of liberty. Hemarried Jane Porter in Londonderry, Ireland in 1694. Recent researchleads us to believe that their son, Thomas Ewing Sr. may have been bornin 1690 in Londonderry rather than 1695 as has been thought for manyyears. He became the first American immigrant of this Ewing line. Thereare several references to Captain Findley Ewing's father as being JamesEwing of Glasgow, Scotland born about 1630 however, the proof of thisfact remains to be found.<br><br>-From the Burt Congragation records, we also learn that Findley firstlived in Inch Island in Lough Swilley, then moved to Fahan on the eastcoast of Lough Swilley. Four of his children were baptized on the 10thof the month--reflecting the many superstitions of the time. The siegeof Londonderry played a part in the movement of some people during thistime. When looking at the American records in New Jersey, they indicatethat besides Thomas Ewing coming to America, his three brothers, William,James and Robert were also immigrants to America.<br><br>Father: William Ewing b: 1625 in Stirlingshire, Scotland <br>Mother: Elizabeth Milford b: 1660 in Dunbarton, Glasgow, Scotland<br><br>Marriage 1 Jane Porter b: 1696 in Of, Londonderry, Ireland<br>Married: in Londonderry, Ireland<br>Children<br> Robert Ewing b: 1718 in Coleraine, Londonderry County, Ireland<br> Charles Ewing b: 1715 in Londonderry, Ireland<br> Thomas Ewing<br> Jean Ewing<br> William Ewing<br> James Ewing<br> Mary Ewing<br> Finley Ewing b: 1694<br></p>

Benj. Longenecker, Recorder Recorded at Lancaster County Recorder's Office, Court House, in Record book B, page 577. CALEB BAKER, SR. Family tradition states that Caleb Baker married Martha Brooks in England, and as she had a grandson by the name of Brooks Baker; this would seem likely to be true. Caleb and Martha Baker reared a family of eight children, Samuel, Henry, Abraham, Caleb Jr., Ruth, Mary, Martha and Ester. It is not known by the writer to whom the three older sons, 1. Samuel, 2 Henry and 3 Abraham married, but Samuel's will probated in Prince Edward County, Virginia, March 16, 1782 mentions his wife Christian and Children: "Samuel, John, Glover, Robert, Caleb, Martha Ewing, Elizabeth Campbell and Sarah Crockett." 4. Martha married Charles Ewing, 5. Ruth married Samuel Johnston, 6. Mary married Robert Ewing, 7. Ester married Samuel Wallace of Amelia County, Virginia., 8. Caleb Jr., married Catherine Hodnett of Buckingham County, Virginia. William H. Whitsitt, of Richmond College, Virginia writing (1888) of the Baker family, states that Caleb Baker's will probated in Prince Edward County, Virginia April 9, 1755. "Is a clear and informing document, and is worthy of careful study, in every instance in the will and sometimes in the deeds recorded in Amelia County. He spells his name, not Baker, but Beaker; that appears to have been in his view an important consideration. His wife and children, and neighbors had no scruples about recording the name Baker; but the father could never be reconciled to that usage. The circumstances appears to indicate that the name was originally the German name Becher, which is the same as the Latin word, Bacar, and the English word, Beaker, and signifies a vessel for drinking wine. The ancestors of Caleb Baker were probably cup-bearers at some Court of high or low degree, and took their name from the function which they there fulfilled. The well known family name of blankenbaker, seems also to refer to the same origin; these who bore it feeling a special pride in maintaining their beaker in a condition of immaculate whiteness. But many a Blankenbaker has found by experience that people in general have small appreciation of the nicer points in philology. The descendants of Caleb Baker made a like discovery, and were compelled to submit when the name should be pronounced, and written Baker, instead of Beaker. They might have saved themselves in a measure if they had Anglicized the name in the form of Beecher, but few of those who employed it in that form would be enabled to make out its original meaning. It would be well, however, if all who bear the name of Caleb Baker, could be informed of these simple facts in connection with it. History is worth preserving for its own sake, and the truth of it should be duly honored." (The American Historical Mag. Vol. 9 pages 384-390). William H. Whitsett, named one of his sons William Baker Whitsett, born May 27, 1883 for Caleb Baker.<br><br>W I L L of Caleb Baker of Prince Edward County, Virginia In the name of God Amen, the 24th day of November, Anne Dom. 1750 I Caleb Baker, of Amelia County, being sick in body but of good and perfect memory, thanks to God for it, and calling to remembrance the uncertainty of this transitory life and that all flesh must yield unto death when it shall please God to call, do make and declare this my last will and Testament in manner and form following: First being penitent and sorry for all my sins, most humbly desiring forgiveness for the same, I commend my Soul to Almighty God, My Savior and Redeemer, in whom and by whose merits I trust assuredly to be saved and to have full redemption and forgiveness for all my sins and to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, and my body I commit to the earth to be duly buried at the discretion of my Executors hereafter named, Martha Beaker, wife of the deceased Caleb Beaker, and Henry Beaker, son of the same: and for the settling of my temporal estate and such goods and chattles and Dept. as it has pleased God to bestow upon me: I declare and give and dispose of the same in the manner and form following, that is to say: Imprimus, I give and bequeath unto my son Samuel Beaker 463 acres of land which is laid off of my own Amelia County, plantation along the spring creek, to him, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns forever; like wise I give and bequeath unto my son Henry Beaker 400 acres of land joining the foregoing piece of land, to him, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns forever.

They were located on the River Forth, nearStirling Castle, in the vicinity of Loch Lomond. Their religion wasPresbyterian. The reproduction of the coat of arms, above, wasrecognized by the Hon. Thomas Ewing family as coming rrom Scottishancestors. near the lower middle of the drawing is "Mask Ewing," shortfor Maskell Ewing.<br>During the min-1600's, there was great religious persecution of theProtestants in Scotland. According to the tradition of the Ewing clan,the Ewings of America trace their origin to six stalwart brothers of aHighland clan, who, with their chieftain, engaged in insurrection in1685, in which they were defeated, their chieftain captured and executedand themselves outlawed It is told that our Ewing ancestors first wentfrom their seat on the River Forth to the Isle of Bute, in Scotland andthen settled at or near Coleraine, County Londonderry, of Ulster, inNorthern Ireland. On July 12, 1690, members of the Ewing Clan took partin the Battle of the Boyne, fought on the river of that name in EasternIreland. In this battle, King James II was opposed by William of Orangewho was fighting for the Irish Protestants. The result of this battlewas the complete overthrow of James, thus forcing his abdication of thethrone and establishing the rule of William and Mary. The anniversary ofthis battle is still celebrated by the Orangemen, or Irish Portestants.<br>Who were these six stalwart Ewing brothers? Much research stillneeds to be done but at this point in time, the brothers might haveincluded John Ewing of Carnshanagh; Robert Ewing, father of Alexander;Findley Ewing, father of<br>Thomas; James Ewing of Inch Island; William Ewing, father of Nathaniel;and possibly an Alexander Ewing.<br>Change Date: 4 Feb 2002 at 17:32:43<br><br>Marriage 1 Elizabeth Milford b: 1660 in Dunbarton, Glasgow, Scotland<br>Married: in Scotland<br>Children<br> John Ewing b: 1648 in Carnashanaugh, Parish of Fabian, County Donegal, Ireland<br> Findley Ewing b: 7 Sep 1691 in Stirling, Scottland<br> Robert Ewing b: 1654 in Stirling Castle, Scotland<br> William Ewing II b: ABT. 1665 in Sterling Castle, Scotland<br> James Ewing Capt.<br> Alexander Ewing<br><br><br></p>

This later became Lancaster Co., PA. Here he purchased 500 acres of land lying on the Susquehanna River from Col. John French. Robert Baker and his son, Caleb Baker paid the taxes on this property from 1719 until 1727. It was here that Robert baker and his sons were gunsmiths. They were commissioned by the King of England to make firearms for the Colonies. At the time of the Revolution the Bakers joined with the Colonies, against England.<br>On 15 Aug 1719, Robert Baker petitioned Jacob Taylor, surveyor for William Penn, for permission to erect a gun boring mill on Pequea Creek. In Feb. 1721, iron ore was found near the site of the Baker land. Robert and his son sought and received permission to mine the ore for commercial use. The ore they mined was reduced to bar-stock available to gun manufacturers. This was the first discovery of ore in the county and predated later gunsmith operations closer to Lancaster.<br>Robert Baker and his father before him were gunsmiths, credited with inventing the Baker Long Rifle.<br>"...a report given to the Kentucky Rifle's Association in 1972. It seems that the Association had employed Mr. Dyke to do some research for them. They wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes called the "Kentucky Rifle." Mr. Dyke in his report states; "We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chaster, Pennsylvania, or New Castle, Delaware, from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop for making guns." He goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August 15, 1719 and asked permission to erect a gun foring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land. Permission was granted. Robert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gunshop and operated it until 1728."<br><br>Provided by: Patty McNary Greer<br><br>Robert Baker Sr. born 1660/1665 some say in Virginia, other records say in Pennsylvania, died September 30, 1728 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Robert was the first to get land in Chester County, Virginia. Wife unknown. Born about 1664 in England. I need to add this in some of my very old records that a Frances Jones had written to my Grandfather Edward McNary back in the 19501's stating that these boys of this family was made to fill the bullets for the Revolutionary War. Even though they were not for Elgland and wanted to do away with taxation. Patty's source: The LDS Library's IGI files and Jean Wood Vore.<br><br><br> Robert Baker, Sr. was granted land and a gun bearing mill formanufacturing of firearms, the PA rifle, by the King of England. RobertBaker was the first man in recorded history to design and manufacture thePA rifle. At his death his son Caleb kept up the tradition and laterused the rifle to great effect in the American Revolution. The rifle waslater known as the Hog Rifle and the Kentucky Rifle in Daniel Boone's day.<br>They were commissioned by the King of England to make fire arms for theColonies. Later the Bakers would join the Colonies against England inthe Revolutionary War.<br>Three of Robert's sons, Samuel, Robert and Douglas married sisters,Elizabeth, Mary and Jane Thompson.<br><br> <br> <br></p>
