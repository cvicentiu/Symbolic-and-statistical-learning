<blockquote>
  <p>The Hunter families of Northwestern Pennsylvania are of Scotch-Irish
  ancestry, a hardy race in which the Scotch stability, shrewdness, mental vigor
  and physical energy are blended with the geniality, warmheartedness, ambitions
  and versatile genius of the Irish. These Hunters come from County Tyrone and
  County Down in Ireland. Poland Hunter , born in 1760 in Ireland, arrived in
  Westmoreland, Pa in the latter part of the eighteenth century. His wife was
  Jane Simpson , an English native, who is reputed to have married Poland
  against her family's wishes. It is said that this is the same Simpson family
  from which Ulysses S. Grant is descended.<br>
  <br>
  Poland and Jane were of true pioneer stock and with all the hopefulness of the
  Irish and the determination of the Scotch blood, built a rude cabin cleared a
  field in the forest and thereby supplied the wants of their growing family.
  Sixteen children were born to Poland and Jane, twelve of which grew to
  maturity. In 1795 Poland Hunter and his family moved to Tionesta and as a
  squatter appropriated the Island which bears his name, located at the mouth of
  the Tionesta River. Here he built his permanent home, farmed the island and as
  a permanent settler obtained from the state a patent establishing ownership.
  Poland and Jane lived on the island most of their lives, although in later
  years Poland moved to the west side of the river. At the base of the hill
  known as Hog Back near Hunter Run he built the first grist mill in Forest
  County. When he died Poland Island was left to his son William for taking care
  of him during the last years of his life. Ownership of the island remained in
  the Hunter family until 1864 when the heirs sold it and the land bordering it
  on the river shore for $14,500. Later owners include: R.J. Harmon, Dan Mullet,
  the Pioneer Material Company, Jamieson Lumber and Supply Company, Frank Ellis
  and F.R. Lanson. Jack Sherman purchased it in February 1953 and established
  the Tionesta Sand &amp; Gravel Company.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to farming, Poland engaged in lumbering, kindred pursuits in those
  days.. The History of Warren County related the following anecdote about
  Poland Hunter, &quot;About the year 1810 while Henry Kinnear was acting in the
  capacity of constable in Venango County, he had a warrant for the arrest of a
  notorious ruffian and desperado named Polen Hunter. Against the threats of the
  criminal, Kinnear attempted his forcible apprehension, when he received from
  Hunter a wound in the hip from which he never recovered. It is said that he
  succeeded in obtaining pecuniary redress for his injury.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The History of Forest County, published in 1868, tell the following story, “Poland
  Hunter was a pretty rough specimen of Irish humanity. He would sometimes take
  on more tanglefoot than he could walk straight under and staggering against a
  stump would say , 'H--l agin a stump and Poland agin that.' Poland Hunter shot
  a man by the name of Kinnear who had a warrant for his arrest. Hunter peppered
  him with shot about the legs. The wound was not mortal. Hunter said that
  shooting him had made him a storekeeper and if he would let him shoot him
  again he would make a wholesale merchant out of him. William Hunter was a chip
  of the old block. Whenever he got too much crooked whiskey his temper got the
  best of him and everybody was in his way. He and a man by the name of Groff
  always fought when they met. Groff was small but full of grit. In one of their
  fights Hunter bit Groff's finger. The next day Groff was crossing the river to
  Hunter's grist mill. He hallooed to Hunter when half-way over the river, I'm
  bringing you another grist of finger nails to grind.”<br>
  <br>
  Though there are no historical records documenting the reason for the warrant
  on Poland Hunter, it is likely the result of legal dispute with John Range Sr.
  over the ownership of Hunter's Island. Chief Cornplanter was called in to be a
  witness and to testify that he had passed through the back channel in a canoe,
  thereby proving that Hunter's Island was indeed an island. Hunter won the
  first case ever tried in Venango County. Later on, Poland's son William would
  marry Lt. John Range’s granddaughter, Sarah Range .<br>
  <br>
  Poland Hunter prospered and survived the hard life of a pioneer until 1840,
  dying at the age of eighty. His wife Jane, companion to all his privation and
  success had died two years earlier. The party spirit ran high, both then and
  now and Poland Hunter and his children were stalwart adherents of the
  Democratic party. Burial was in the private Hunter cemetery on the west side
  at the approach of the hill from Tionesta to Oil City.<br>
