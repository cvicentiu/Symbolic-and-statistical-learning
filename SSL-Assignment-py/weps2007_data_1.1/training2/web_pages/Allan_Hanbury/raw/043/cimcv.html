<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div id="paragraph"><p align="justify">
Vision data represent huge technical challenges to
computer interpretation because of:
<ul><li>    complex semantics; as an
example, despite considerable effort, no general satisfactory
method of automatic object detection in images exists;
<li>    their
very large size, a problem further compounded by the need in many
applications for "real-time" computation.
</ul>
Addressing the first challenge adequately often requires complex
modelling which in turn requires computation intensive
implementation, which in turn conflicts with meeting the latter
challenge. <BR>

This one-day workshop, will bring together researchers to address
computational issues that arise in the analysis of computer vision
data. It is organized through the Network of Excellence
<A href="http://www.muscle-noe.org"> MUSCLE</A>. The objectives of the workshop are to:
<ul><li>Present research on state of the art computation intensive methods
for management, retrieval and knowledge discovery for vision data;
<li>Discuss future directions for research;
<li>Encourage collaboration
between research groups in these areas.
</ul>
</p></div> 

<a name="topics"></a>
<h3>General Topics of Interest</h3>  

<div id="paragraph"><p align="justify">
There
will be invited and contributed talks and a round-table discussion
on future directions. Paper submissions for contributed talks are
sought in the areas of the following topics as they relate to
vision data analysis:
<ul>
<li> Monte Carlo methods, including Markov
chain Monte Carlo, sequential approaches and convergence issues; 
<li> dimension reduction and re-parameterization for faster computing; 
<li> the use of distributed (clusters, grids) computing;
<li> real-time image and video applications; 
<li> optimization (annealing, variational,...) methods and PDEs for computer
vision; 
<li> vision applications implemented by computation intensive
methods; 
<li> indexing and retrieval in large image and video databases. 
</ul>
</p></div>

<h3>Paper Submission</h3>
<div id="paragraph"><p align="justify">
Two types of paper are sought:
full papers and short papers for presentation as posters. Both
completed work and work in progress are encouraged. Full papers
should follow the length and format requirements for submission to
the main ECCV conference (see <a href="http://eccv2006.tugraz.at/"> 
http://eccv2006.tugraz.at/</a>). Short
papers should not exceed 3 pages, again using the
format of the main ECCV meeting. <br>

Submission should be made by sending a pdf version of the paper by
e-mail to <a href="mailto:simon.wilson@tcd.ie">simon.wilson@tcd.ie</a>.  The name of the paper should be in
the format CIMCV_FirstAuthorNameFirstAuthorSurname.pdf e.g.
CIMCV_SimonWilson.pdf. <br>

The final camera-ready paper should follow the same template as
ECCV. <br>

All accepted papers will be published on an
accompanying ECCV 2006 Workshops CD/DVD, which will be given to
all participants attending the workshops. <BR>

All inquiries should be addressed to <a href="mailto:simon.wilson@tcd.ie">simon.wilson@tcd.ie</a>. <BR>
