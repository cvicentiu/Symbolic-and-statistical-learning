Dear Colleagues,

Numerous requests have persuaded us to grant an extension to the upcomming
ECDL main paper, panel and tutorial submission deadlines, shifting them to 

                 *** Monday, March 7 ***

In order to allow for some advance planning of review assignments we would,
however, appreciate it, if authors would consider submitting the
abstract of their paper via the submission system by the original deadline.


Best regards,

Andreas Rauber, Stavros Christodoulakis
ECDL 2005 PC Co-Chairs

*******************************************************************

ECDL 2005 is the 9th conference in the series of European Digital Library conferences. ECDL has become the major European conference on digital libraries, and associated technical, practical, and social issues, bringing together researchers, developers, content providers and users in the field. ECDL 2005 is jointly organized by the Vienna University of Technology (VUT), the Austrian National Library (OeNB), and the Austrian Computer Society (OCG).

ECDL 2005 invites original contributions focusing on research and development supporting information access and exploration both from a technology perspective as well as in different application-domains such as science, e-government, cultural heritage, etc.

Topics of contributions include (but are not limited to):

- Concepts of Digital Libraries and Digital Documents
- System Architectures, Integration and Interoperability
- Information Organization, Search and Usage
- User Studies and System Evaluation
- Digital Preservation
- Digital Library Applications

***************        Full paper submission          ***************
*********************************************************************


Papers (maximum 12 pages for full papers, max 8 pages for short papers in Springer LNCS format) should report on original, completed research, applications and development that have not previously been presented elsewhere and that make new contributions to the conference topics.

The full text of papers in English (no extended abstracts) is required at the initial submission stage for review, and must follow the format guidelines given below. In the spirit of digital libraries all papers must be submitted electronically via the conference web page.

The proceedings will be published by Springer in the series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), in hard copy and electronic form. The authors must follow the guidelines for the LNCS format provided by Springer (<A HREF="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</A>) already for the initial full text submission. (We recommend the use of LaTeX2e for best results and easiest handling of your documents (now and in the future), but Springer also provides a template for Microsoft Windows.) It is the responsibility of authors to ensure that their submission use no unusual format features and are printable on a standard Postscript printer.

For the initial full text submission for review, authors are requested to submit the paper as a single pdf-file. (If this constitutes a hardship, or if you have problems submitting the paper via the web-based conference management review system, please contact the program chairs by email pc_chairs@ecdl2005.org to arrange an alternative means of submission.) All papers will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program Committee.

Papers are to be submitted via the ECDL2005 Conference Management system by the submission deadline.

Final camera-ready submission:

If accepted, camera-ready versions of papers incorporating changes recommended by the Reviewers, are to be submitted both in PDF as well as in source format (LaTeX, Microsoft Word or RTF). Detailed information will be provided with the acceptance notification, and all final versions will have to be submitted by the submission deadline for final versions. Accepted papers MUST be presented by an/the author at the conference.
