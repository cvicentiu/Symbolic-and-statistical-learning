Boston kicks ass !!!!!!! Sound just as good today as they did 20 years ago.<BR>Keep it up and lets do another tour eh? How about come to Alaska this time around !!!!!! If your worried about air-play up here, don't. Boston gets awesome air-play up here in all the big and little cities/towns. Anchorage, Alaska has an arena that can hold up o 9000 people and Fairbanks has one that can hold up to 6500 people. Think about it please. Hope to see you soon...............

I've been listening BOSTON for about 20 years and its good to see that the band keeps going. The last CD was great specially the new songs. Keep going. We dont need CD every year, we need is good music. If anytime you're planning to go to Portugal please say something I'm responsible for a 28 acre biological farm and we're also starting a project with teenagers with certain problems finding jobs. We'll shape them here for 3 months and then we will try to put them in the job market. Bye.

I have devoted my entire life<BR>to music and would like to go into that field in the next few years.<BR>Do you have any suggestions?<BR>                                    Gary Johnson<BR>                Micky Billy

Well, there is this girl that I have a crush on and her name is Amanda, and this song is just perfect for her.  "A Man I'll Never Be"  is also a goo song for her.  N-E-ways...ROCK ON BOSTON!!!!!!

After reading the other submissions, I'm glad I live in the USA and can see all<BR>of Boston's tours! You poor foreigners; I feel bad for you! All I can say is come <BR>to the States and catch them here; it's worth it. The guys in the band seem to<BR>subscribe to the saying "There's no place like home."<BR>Since I live in the Boston area I also get to see Brad sing in his local <BR>band, Beatle Juice. Man, is he in his element! I think he enjoys singing Beatles <BR>more than he enjoys singing Boston. Plus, he gets to go home to his own bed <BR>after the shows!<BR>Brad, please be careful with that beautiful voice. Don't burn yourself out with <BR>those looong 'Juice' shows! By the way; nice hair cut. (Was that diamond stud<BR>always under there?) Your voice soothed me through my teens. Thanks.<BR>Tom, Boston's going to sound so great WHEN you start using real drums in the<BR>studio again. Love the first 2 albums best because of their "real-ness."<BR>Thanks for making my all-time favorite music.  <BR>Barry, I miss your presence. Love your 3 post-Boston albums; hope for more.<BR>See you next time........

<BR>Hey Boston. I wanted to get the most and newest info for this year. Although, I did get the greatest hits after the week and before the concert. The main musician I admire the most is Tom Scholz because he is an excellent musician and he is the band leader. Although, I think Brad should be the second band leader, if thats alright Tom. Anyways, I like to say that you ruled the concert stage at the Universal Amphitheater last year in 97, and I thought you guys kicked ass. Anyways, I'm a musician also. I play guitars,keyboards/piano, and bass. Well gotta go.  I am really going to be a #1 fan of you and Tom>

Brad, it was good to see you perform (with Beatle Juice at Sharky's in Nashua)<BR>You still have the electricity!!!  I will be there again in April.  As for BOSTON, I<BR>hope that you can keep recording with these guys as well as wrting for/with them.  Your writing style adds SO MUCH to the group, a distintive blues-oriented<BR>sound that makes it great. Go, Pats!  (next year)  When are we going to play<BR>b-ball??    -Marc

I really enjoy having access to the BOSTON-related information stored in the boston.org server.  I regularly quiz my dad on stats. about the group (he went to high school in the mid-70s when BOSTON was extremely popular).  I'm 16, which doesn't help my collection of knowledge about BOSTON, but this website gives me access to retrieve the facts about this band that I missed learning when BOSTON was the favorite band in America (before I was born).

This is in response to Marc Jackson and Pete Heilig's posts.<BR>I think that it's great that you guys like Boston,<BR>but you guys have crossed the line. Your views on vegitarianism<BR>and the band's beliefs are immature and closed minded. I don't know<BR>how you guys can say that you like Boston, but you deny all truth<BR>to their beliefs; you are very naive. I do see your point when you<BR>give your unwanted descriptions of animals being torn apart and<BR>the rest of your immature babbling; but that doesn't mean that<BR>vegitarians suck. It's their choice to put that on their albums;<BR>if you don't like it, don't look at it!<BR>You are a very childish; grow up.<BR>                                 Veteran Chaw

 Golly-gee Frederick, that's a real good point you <BR>don't have there. I find it amusing that people like <BR>you use the term "close-minded" to describe anyone <BR>you disagree with; that IS, by your own usage, <BR>close-mindedness. You're one of those fanatical types <BR>who link themselves to a band and suddenly every word <BR>that pours out of their mouths is "truth", as you put <BR>it; THAT's naivete', Fred my boy. C'mon, they're a <BR>rock band, not prophets. I don't recall using the <BR>actual terminology "vegetarians suck". On the contrary, <BR>vegetarians CAN'T suck--no upper body strength. Yes, <BR>it IS their choice to put vegetarian propaganda on <BR>their albums. It's also their choice to have a <BR>"guestbook". To use your words, "If you don't like it, <BR>don't look at it". Are you a vegetarian Frederick? Do<BR>you take "supplements"? I bet you have two, forward-<BR>facing eyes, don't you? Wait a second, you said that<BR>you "see our point", and then refer to it as "immature<BR>babbling"; That kind of puts you at ground-zero my<BR>friend.

My two cents:<BR>I haven't eaten meat for almost 20 years. I'm 5' ,11" and weigh 200 lbs.<BR>Plenty of upper (and lower) body strength here, I can assure you. Humans are<BR>lucky to be intelligent omnivores. We can eat plant or animal or both <BR>successfully. Meat eaters can make dietary mistakes the same as <BR>vegetarians can. It's an outdated idea that humans need meat. Tom, Brad and <BR>the rest of us millions are the proof. But for those of you who still like <BR>dead animals in your food, more power to you! Hey, if it doesn't bother you to <BR>have, for example, ground up pig vains in your stomach, it certainly doesn't<BR>bother me! Bon appetit! And I mean that simcerely.

 Nice message. "Rich Aucoin", where do I know that<BR>name from? <BR> I agree absolutely that humans are opportunistic<BR>omnivores, but we're not built to graze exclusively<BR>and we're psychologically predisposed to kill--even<BR>if some choose to deny that impulse. In fact, people <BR>who have never killed for food are missing an impor-<BR>tant part of their psychological development.<BR><BR> We're built like a meat-eater, and were never meant <BR>to eat such an innordinate amount of vegetable matter. <BR>I, apparently like yourself, believe in moderation. <BR>Too much of one thing is always bad. A person can eat <BR>too much of anything. <BR> Either way, I intend on ceasing this dialogue on this <BR>page.  It IS after all BOSTON'S page and I respect <BR>their right to spread their misinformation in peace. <BR>I DO like their music, though.

I have been an avid Boston nut since, like a lot of other people wasjust totally mesmorized<BR>and hooked on the group the first time I heard the song MTAF. Up until that time, I <BR>usually listened to my mothers music, mainly country (Loretta Lynn/Conway Twitty).<BR>The first time I ever heard the song, it was a K-Tel commercial and I absolutely fell in<BR>love with the song. It was the first 45 I ever owned. I finally got the album 2 years later<BR>and have probably bought the album (records, 8-track, cassette, cd) 10 times from wear and tear.<BR>I own all 5 on cd and they are always sitting ready in my cd player and when I do something,<BR>that I want to listen to music, I play random and jam out. I can do anything with BOSTON blaring in <BR>my ear. It is so hard to say what my favorites are. I have always had a special <BR>connection to "More than a feeling". I also love the "Don't Look Back/journey/<BR>It's Easy combo. Hitch a ride is one of my biggest favorites. The lead switching at the end<BR>of thesong is wonderful. Feelin' Satisfied is the best driving song I have ever heard. It makes<BR>me want to drive down the highway at 100 MPH every time I hear it. On the 3rd album,I love<BR>Hollyann and Cant'cha say. good rock. cool the Engines is very good as well.<BR>The walk on Medley is superb from their 4th album. Reminds me of Older Boston <BR>(except without Brad Delp :(. I also like the new songs from greatest hits.<BR>I am anctiously awaiting a 6th album and a live album would be nice. Can't wait to see <BR>them in concert again.<BR>BOSTON ROCKS THE UNIVERSE. <BR>

Boston rocks. Tom Scholz has been an influence on me from the start.  I have 2 albums out "Long Overdue" and "Eye Of The Storm", both of which are heavily Boston influenced.  In fact Rockmans were used for all guitar sounds!  I am currently writing for a new album, and an actively looking for a vocalist similar in vein to Brad Delp (if such a creature exsists).  If anyone should know of a vocalist interested in colaborating, please Email me @ mickeydoo@greenet.com.   Thanks......Looking foward to some new Boston... any in the works?

I first heard Boston as a high school junior in 1976. Went to my first concert in Charlotte, NC's tiny Ovens Auditorium. What a blast! I was totally hooked on what I still consider to be the best rock n roll ever made. From then on, I wouldn't even go out with a guy unless he owned the Boston album or tape. Needless to say, not even one person was weeded out. EVERYBODY had Boston's music. It's great that Boston is still around, putting out those too-too infrequent albums. Still, the integrity is still there. This is not a has-been group taking advantage of retro craze. What is so great about this band is Tom. He really seems to love the art of the music. Keep on rocking and all the fans will remain.<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Lisa<BR>

I first discovered Boston when "More than a feeling" came on the radio in <BR>San Diego (1992)and I could not get that great guitar riff out of my head.  As <BR>As soon as I returned home to Las Vegas, I bought "Boston", "Don't Look Back",<BR>and "Third Stage".  I got "Walk On" the day it was released; and was able to<BR>see them on the subsequent tour.  I saw them again in Dallas in 1997 and <BR>cannot wait to see them again.  Boston is THE best band in the world.<BR>Please keep touring and cutting new material.
