<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>From correspondents in London

 September 26, 2004

 BRITAIN was doing everything it could to try to secure the release of a British engineer held hostage in Iraq and threatened with execution, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today.

 "We'll continue to do all we can for Ken Bigley," Mr Blair said as he arrived in the southern coastal resort of Brighton on the eve of his Labour Party conference.

He also praised the "dignified" way in which the family of Mr Bigley, seized along with two Americans from his Baghdad home on September 16, were handling the crisis.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Even as late as the 1980s, that notion was universally accepted. Compared to wild Montreal, Toronto was a stuffy Presbyterian banking city that preferred to hide its dark side and wondered out loud what it could possibly do to contribute to Canadian culture. 

Those of us who visited regularly, however, knew that the image wasn't fact and, perhaps, never was. 

Whether we like it or not, Toronto IS Canadian culture. At least, English-speaking culture, and while that makes a lot of Canadians crazy, it's hard to dispute. 

Now, granted, you don't go to Toronto to sit in bars until four in the morning as you would on Montreal's Crescent Street.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

 Comedy is king at 2nd world film festival of bangkok

There are comedies where a good time is had by all until the credits start rolling. And that's it. There are also comedies where something lingers after people have stopped rolling in the aisles. These films provoke thought about the human condition, often puzzling or tragic. 

It's such "high" comedy, as the ancient Greeks called it, that the Kings of Comedy section will bring to the World Film Festival of Bangkok.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

Having twice stormed Cannes with his abstract intellectualism, Apichatpong Weerasethakul is stunning fans by tickling their funny bones with his hilarious action musical "The Adventure of Iron Pussy".

It's an instant camp classic.

Co-directed and starring Michael Shaowanasai, "Iron Pussy" is jaw-droppingly outrageous, with a transvestite secret agent on a glamorous, 007-style mission full of karate kicks and satiric humour, all sharply edited.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Sept 21, 2004 (AXcess News) Bangkok 

 - Thailand and Malaysia will tighten controls 

 over shipments of poultry across their border 

 in a bid to halt the spread of bird flu. The agreement 

 comes as groups opposed to animal trafficking 

 warn the trade may also lead to the spread of 

 diseases from animals to humans.

Senior agricultural officials from 

 Malaysia and Thailand, meeting in Bangkok Tuesday, 

 agreed to step up efforts to curb the movement 

 of poultry across their border.

Malaysian officials have blamed 

 smuggled Thai fighting cocks for an outbreak of 

 avian flu in Kelantan state.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

 to discourage deception and protect investors, 

 provide a pair of mechanisms that fuel fraudulent 

 stock schemes. Or, to put it slightly differently, 

 securities laws that are designed to foster transparency

One fundamental precept underlies

Tawhid wal Jihad, led by Jordanian

 BRITAIN was doing everything it could to try to secure the release of a British engineer held hostage in Iraq and threatened with execution, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today.

 "We'll continue to do all we can for Ken Bigley," Mr Blair said as he arrived in the southern coastal resort of Brighton on the eve of his Labour Party conference.

He also praised the "dignified" way in which the family of Mr Bigley, seized along with two Americans from his Baghdad home on September 16, were handling the crisis.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>A North Korean boy waves from a bus window after arriving in South 

 Korea in a secret operation via an unidentified southeast Asian country - Reuters 

The increasing flow of North Korean refugees into South Korea 

 is proving to be a real stumbling block to inter-country negotiations. 

The arrival in the South of 468 North Korean refugees via Vietnam in July, the 

 largest mass defection since the end of the Korean War, led Pyongyang to cancel 

 bilateral economic talks with Seoul, denounce authorities there as "wicked 

 terrorists'', and withdraw its ambassador from Hanoi.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>After a whirlwind tour of India last week, Prof. Richard Feachem, the executive director of the Global Fund Against AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) appears watchfully optimistic about the way HIV/AIDS control programme in India has progressed since his visit last year. 

Feachem was on a mission to revive ties with friends in the new government, especially with the recently elected Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who worked alongside Feachem at the Commission of Macroeconomics and Health (CMH) in Geneva. He hopes that his visit will bring in more intent and commitment in the existing governance and policy on HIV/AIDS.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Mike Jefferies and Stuart Ford are reported to be in talks with the club with a view to putting together a deal worth 100million. 

"We would like to be able to contribute to helping Liverpool become the most successful club in the world again," Jefferies told the Financial Times. 

Jefferies is the chairman of Los Angeles-based Milkshake Films, and is currently producing Goal!, a football movie trilogy to be released from next year. Ford is an entertainment lawyer and movie executive previously with Miramax Films. 

Their interest could spark a three-way battle for control of Liverpool.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

Airline ticket prices in Southeast Asia have fallen below bus fares, with a one-way ticket between Singapore and the Thai resort of Phuket advertised for as little as 29 Singapore cents.

But just as most people will never get to fly at such impossibly low prices because of an array of hidden costs ranging from airport taxes to service fees, some airlines trumpeting the deals ultimately may not survive the price war.

"Not everyone is going to make it," said Chris Sanda, an associate director of equity research at DBS Vickers Securities in Singapore.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

After his father died in 1833, Le Van Duyet's son, Le Van Khoi, rebelled and held Gia-dinh until the citadel of Phien An fell in July 1835. Among the 1,831 prisoners who were put to death was the priest Marchand.
