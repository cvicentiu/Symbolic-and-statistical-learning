<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Every athlete in every sport at every level has bad games from time to time. Even Jim Brown, Michael Jordan and Willie Mays had days they&#8217;d like to forget. 

So for Browns quarterback Jeff Garcia to have had a rotten day last Sunday in the 19-12 loss at Dallas is not so earthshaking that it&#8217;s going to move mountains. Neither is the fact it was especially horrific &#8211; arguably the worst performance Garcia has ever had on a football field going all the way back to his youth league days. To get a 0.0 passing rating pretty much says it all.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

"It's cool," said younger brother Bobby. "We know a lot about each other, so things go well on the court."

The brothers, while both tennis players for the past several years, are playing together at doubles for the first time. Bobby missed the first week of practice, so the pairing happened late but has a positive effect throughout the team.

"Sometimes we are reluctant to put siblings together because they can get into that bicker mode," said Head Tennis Coach Dennis Johnson. "They wanted to play together and they support each other so it has been a good situation.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>VIENNA - The UN nuclear watchdog is to send experts to Jordan to verify whether the ageing Dimona nuclear plant just across the border in Israel is emitting high levels of radiation, an IAEA spokesman said on Saturday. 

"We have received a request from the Jordanian government to assist them monitoring the radiological situation," said Mark Gwozdecky, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 

"We agreed to send a fact-finding mission in the coming weeks to help them determine whether there is any radiological incident.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>afrol News, 22 September - The European Union (EU) is consolidating its role as a major oil and gas customer in North Africa. In particular Egypt's vast gas resources are catching the EU's attention.

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Jefferson County will be compensated for the impact of the Pelton Round Butte Hydroelectric Project, it was announced Tuesday. 

 For over two years, Portland General Electric (PGE) and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS), owners of the project, have wrangled over terms of the agreement. 

 "The Tribes and PGE worked well with the county on this," said Mike Morgan, former county administrator and current city administrator. 

 "The credit goes back to when Janet Brown was commissioner," said Morgan, "She set the tone for the negotiations." Since then, Morgan has negotiated on behalf of the county."

 The agreement includes: $2.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Michael Jordan averaged 20 points and six rebounds for the Washington Wizards in the 2002-2003 season, the last time he suited up. Those are decent numbers by most standards, although the bar Jordan set is about 100 notches above "decent." 

Could Jordan, at 41, be a meaningful contributor to an NBA team next season? I certainly wouldn't bet against him. Teams could do worse than having Jordan in their rotation, providing 15-20 minutes per night at small forward, and a season-long presence in the locker room. 

There are rumors he's contemplating a comeback with Miami.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

Jordan said culture is more than just a word. Everyone will be able to showcase their work and demonstrate their skills from dying dance forms to contemporary music, from weaving to tapestry.

While Erickson waits for his next day in court, others in the Flathead Valley are preparing to take on a family court services system they say has gone wrong. Some 20 people in the valley - Erickson included - are banding together and preparing a class-action lawsuit against Family Court Services with the aim of changing the system.

Deanna Prouty of Kalispell is leading the charge. She has taken out ads in the local Mountain Trader newspaper, soliciting people who feel wronged.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

A landmark court hearing that pits organic growers against the makers of genetically modified canola has been postponed. 

Members of the Saskatchewan Organic Directorate were set to duke it out with Monsanto Canada Inc. and Bayer CropScience Inc. in a Sept. 14-15 trial that would determine whether the growers had the grounds to launch a class action suit. 

They are seeking damages from the two biotechnology companies for the introduction of GM canola, which they claim has destroyed markets for organic canola.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

 The sport's ringmaster, Bernie Ecclestone, was busy upsetting Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi, while Flavio Briatore, the Renault team principal, joined in with a scathing attack on the media, condemning them for negative comments about the health of the sport.

 It all started earlier this month when Ford put the Jaguar team up for sale, along with Cosworth Racing, which also supplies engines to Jordan and Minardi.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

Take Wallace's first touch of the game, which came on the Tigers' second possession. He charged through the line of scrimmage, found space, and sprinted 69 yards for his first score of the game.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Since Hamas suicide bombings killed 16 Israelis in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on Aug. 31, Israeli officials began focusing their warnings on Syria and the Hamas leaders like Mashaal who are based in Damascus. Hamas officials say all attacks are planned and carried out by operatives in the Palestinian territories.

In recent years, Israel has killed top Hamas leaders in the West Bank and Gaza. Just how effective these assassinations have been is not clear.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>SHANGHAI: Formula One is likely to continue with the same number of teams next season despite Ford's decision to quit, world motorsport head Max Mosley said yesterday.

 Ford owns the Jaguar team which is up for sale along with engine maker Cosworth - also supplier to struggling Jordan and Minardi.

"What I think is the most likely scenario . is that someone will buy Jaguar, Minardi will keep going like they always have and Jordan will find a solution in one way or another," the International Automobile Federation (FIA) president told reporters at the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix.

"And we will have the same 20 cars next year," he added.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

 Quote: Although I am not an expert in Israel's history, it seems to me that Israel was formed by people who were otherwise welcome in the region but then expelled Palestinians by force and created their own state, by religious motivation of "divine right" to the land, again, by force. 

 First of all, historically Jewish people have never been 'welcome' in the Middle East (nor for that matter in many other regions). Secondly, Israel was created as a result of the Balfour Declaration in which Briton intended to eventually create an Israeli state in their colony of Trans-Jordan.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Jordan seeks to protect its truck drivers in Iraq

 (AFP)

25 September 2004 

AMMAN - Jordan has called on the Iraqi authorities to ensure the safety of its truck drivers in the face of a wave of abductions in the strife-torn country, a Jordanian newspaper reported Saturday.

"Trucks taking the Baghdad international motorway still have no protection despite the fact that they continue, despite the danger, to deliver food and medicine to Iraq," Transport Minister Raed Abu Saud told the Al-Rai newspaper.

The minister said that an agreement had been reached concerning truckers' security with the Iraqi authorities, without going into details.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>By Alan Baldwin

 SHANGHAI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Minardi, the slowest team in Formula One, are seeking an exemption from next year's rule changes designed to reduce speeds on safety grounds.

 Team boss Paul Stoddart said he had written to all teams seeking agreement to his request after Ford announced they were pulling out of Formula One and selling Cosworth, Minardi's engine providers.

 The uncertainty over Cosworth threatens to leave both Minardi, some three seconds off the pace in Chinese Grand Prix qualifying on Saturday, and Jordan without engines.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

Then he spun and I was really shocked, because he does not do that very often. This is a phenomenal circuit with different lines through the corners which means it is easy to make mistakes. As for my lap, the balance of my car was good and worked well on new tyres. I was especially strong in the second section, as I have been all weekend and the first section was also good.

"We are in a state of alert and vigilance," he told The Associated Press this week during an unannounced visit to Cairo from his home base in the Syrian capital, Damascus.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>Cura could be out of Jordan mix

By David R. SmithMPG Newspapers

PLYMOUTH (Sept 25) - There's no end in sight for end of life care at Jordan Hospital. However, the agency responsible for administering home health care through Jordan will likely be shown the door.

Cura VNA (visiting nurse association) and Cranberry Hospice operate as a joint agency affiliated with Jordan Hospital. The two merged in 1998.

Cura's board of directors met Wednesday to discuss the agency's future following several years of financial problems with the agency and its subsequent inability to accept new patients in certain categories of care.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

The Castle quarterback nimbly tiptoed out of the way of Farrington pass rushers and connected with eight different receivers to lead the Knights past the Governors 34-19 in Oahu Interscholastic Association Red East Conference football last night at Aloha Stadium.

Mansanas completed 17 of 26 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns in front of 2,407. Many times, he waited until the last possible moment before letting passes go, leaving the Govs' defenders tuckered out and empty-handed.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE=2>The University of Northern B.C. Timberwolves men's basketball team got a little bigger a little faster and a little stronger during the off season and head coach Zane Robison says the style of the game will be different. 

"We have lots of size and athleticism. Our style of play is going to be very different. I think we're going to be a fast paced run and gun team because we got the athletes for that. In the past we've been a slower team we were good, but we weren't fast and athletic like we are this year. That's going to change and we are going to be more entertaining for the fans," said Robison.<BR></font></TD></TR></TABLE>
