This trio pops out with a fuzzy dynamic burst of rock that feels just right
while you're sitting outside, waiting for the springtime to really hit. The
vocals are very close to a Throwing Muses-style warble, while the guitar fills
in the space just right with a nice warm glow--sometimes slow and sometimes as
bright and fast as lightning. The drums keep everything on track and everyone
seems happy. Singers Jen Stavely and Teri Morris do a nice job of dueling and
dueting with each other, the twin female vocals wrap around the sonic acrobatics
like a melodic tightrope and the rhythm section keeps a tight safety net below.
There's nice shifting dynamics between songs, giving the CD a cohesive feel,
though the songs don't all sound the same.<br>

<b>From: <u>THE NOISE</u>, May 2002</b><br>
<br>
Down with the Furies is Tizzy's follow-up to 1999's Scary in Adulthood and with
these eleven tracks this Northampton-based trio explores a new pinnacle of
mediocrity. Some songs creep to the edge of interesting but fizzle because they
stick so stubbornly to a formulaic cookie-cutter pattern. Man, it's frustrating
as hell, like when you ALMOST unscramble the porn channel, but then the whole
things dissolves intoa distorted mess. &quot;Is that a booby? Yeah! Oh no...
it's just a doorknob.&quot; Down with the Furies is all doorknobs.<br>
<br>
The thing about Tizzy is that you genuinely want to dig their indie girl
tandem--vocal cacophony, their everyday trifling lyrics, and their chunky,
simple pop beats. Like on Scary in Adulthood, Tizzy's still doing the
&quot;let's sound like Sleater-Kinney&quot; thing. But without the trademark
Sleater-Kinney manic grit, it ends up sounding contrived. And that's just it.
Trademark. Sleater-Kinney is already Sleater-Kinney. Throwing Muses is already
Throwing Muses, and the Pixes...well, you get the idea. It's not that Tizzy
doesn't have anything to contribute, but we've all heard this kind of thing done
so much better. Everyone knows what happens when you make copies of copies of
copies.<br>
<br>
You're still thinking about boobies, aren't you. Aw yeah, baby.<br>

&quot;Down With the Furies&quot;, Vital Cog Records<br>
Tizzy's second full-length album, Down With the Furies, is an energetic indie-pop
record in the tradition of bands such as Tiger Trap and Fuzzy. The dual female
vocals ride atop fast-paced, familiar sounding tunes that make you wanna jump
around like the indie-pop geek that you are. (That wasn't meant to be
derogatory, I fall into that category myself.) This is a fun record guaranteed
to piss off your brooding, angst-ridden friends. (CL)<br>
<br>
From <u>the Valley Advocate</u>: by Michael Manekin<br>
<br>
Before indie rock went electronic (a la Tortoise), retro soul (a la the Makeups),
and fucking inscrutable (a log Mogwai), the Pioneer Valley was bursting with
indie pop bands, all dying to tour the country and make their band your life.<br>
<br>
And in the mid-90's, the Northampton trio Tizzy almost fulfilled the dream.
Formed by Jen Stavely nearly a decade ago, Tizzy eventually power-popped its way
into the hearts of indie kids as far away as Boston and onto the tours of more
successful, like-minded bands (Versus, Small Factory). Alas, even after
releasing singles on marquee indie labels like Pop Narcotice and SpinArt, Tizzy
never quite took their shit national.<br>
<br>
But if anyone still cares, Tizzy is alive, well, and actually better than ever.
Influenced by the smarty-pants, scrappy-ass sounds of girl-boy combos like
Scrawl, Tsunami, and the Throwing Muses, Tizzy has always been a cut or two
above the indie rocks hoi polloi, and their lates, &quot;Down With the
Furies&quot;, is the slap-happy sound of a punk band in its prime.<br>
<br>
In between the rapid tempo shifts, atop the three-chord chug, and beneath the
arty dissonance, bassist Stavely and drummer Teri Morris harmonize observations
about ennui, roads not taken- and relationships (relationships, relationships,
relationships!) The harmonies are hooky; the adrenaline surging; and the lyrics,
amusing- especially when sending up a certain kind of cool. (&quot;You
understand about me and Husker Du...&quot;).<br>
<br>
Whether or not YOU understand about Husker Du (not to mention college radio,
ringer T-shirts and such perplexing sights as a room full of white kids rocking
out with their arms crossed), please know that, after all these years, Tizzy is
still one of the finest bands in the Valley. And Down with the Furies- well
worth a purchase.<br>
<br>
Hey, it's only indie rocks... but it's also exquisite. 4 stars.<br>
<br>
From <u>The Hartford Courant</u>: Dec. 27th, 2001<br>
<br>
She's A Drummer, But So What?<br>
<br>
At 31, Teri Morris has been playing drums for years - and in rock bands for more
than a decade. But sometimes when she and her trio Tizzy play places,she still
gets approached by people who are surprised to see her back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still get a lot of: `I've never seen a girl play drums before,'&quot;
Morris says. &quot;I mean, it's 2001. How sad is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Still, she tries to keep optimistic about it. &quot;When a lot of guys say,
`You're pretty good for a girl,' you can either take it as an insult or as a
compliment,&quot; says Morris, over the phone from Baltimore, where she was
spending Christmas at her sister's house. &quot;I've tried to have a mindset
that since these people never saw a woman play drums before, next time it won't
be such a big deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
If she's opening doors for women in rock, that's cool with her. After all, she
didn't have that many role models to follow.<br>
<br>
&quot;We get compared to Sleater-Kinney a lot,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't
know how fair it is, since they're one of the only other bands with two women
kind of thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
There would be more female drummers, she says, but &quot;a lot of women are
never told they can play.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember in sixth grade auditioning for a marching band, and there were
too many drummers - there were 10 of us. I was the only girl. The music teacher
looked at me and said, `You're going to play flute.' I said, hey I've been
taking drum lessons two years. And, in a big mark for feminism, I started to
cry. So he left me alone. It's just that some people have an inherent sense that
drums aren't for women.&quot;<br>
<br>
Morris kept playing drums in marching bands when her family moved to
Connecticut. And it was while she was in the Tolland High School band that she
was told about a local band was looking for a drummer. As a teenager, Morris
played in Hartford's Crystallized Movements a couple of years before she moved
north to the Pioneer Valley to attend the University of Massachusetts after a
stint at Berklee School of Music. There, she played in a couple of bands before
joining forces with Jen Stavely, the lead singer who started Tizzy. With Tizzy
for the first time, she was encouraged to contribute more to the songs'
arrangements and sing a lot of background.<br>
<br>
The harmonies in Tizzy are now what helps set them apart. The threesome has
weathered a recent change when guitarist Joel Boultinghouse left at just about
the time the new album came out. The replacement is another Northampton
musician, Caleb Wetmore, formerly of the Mitchells.<br>
<br>
&quot;He definitely has a different playing style,&quot; Morris says.
&quot;Caleb is more precise, and very particular of tone and accuracy, while
Joel was more free-spirited. They each bring a lot that's definitely
interesting.&quot;<br>
<br>
From <a href="http://www.adequacy.net/reviews/12-01/12-10-01.shtml#tizzy"><u>delusions
of adequacy:</u></a><br>
Only after I was able to get over the fact that Tizzy is not and will never be a
death metal band (the dark and blurry cover combined with the album title…)
was I able to enjoy their music. With their dual female vocals, Tizzy shares
similarities with the likes of Sleater-Kinney's recent work. But compared to
that almost universally praised band, Tizzy is less focused, darker, and more on
the chord-poppy than finger pick-angular side. Perhaps the biggest contrast
between the two bands is Tizzy's use of bass and love for extreme tempo changes.<br>
<br>
Tizzy consists of Jen Stavely on bass and vocals, Teri Morris on drums and
vocals, and Joel Boultinghouse on guitar. The straightforward &quot;Reminders
for the Reactive&quot; starts off Down with the Furies with fast tempo.
&quot;Pushing Positive&quot; lightens things up with a harmless &quot;You're No
Rock 'n Roll Fun&quot; nature, &quot;A cold beer on a cold day / Outside in a
parking lot / I felt like a queen and not so mean / As I decide what I am and
what I'm not.&quot; Then comes &quot;Forgiveness is a Curse,&quot; which is a
little too punk, not sounding like the same Tizzy that I was introduced to on
the album's first two songs. Fortunately, the bass-driven pop/punk of that song
breaks into a pleasant vocal harmonization, reminiscent of That Dog. But the
song ends in the same punky way that started the song.<br>
<br>
Stavely reveals her frustration with the work life in the half slow and droning,
half fast and guitar-driven, &quot;Work Ethic&quot;: &quot;I feel driven as I
drive to work / To make good and earn my keep / But then I wonder why as life is
passing me by / What it's worth when my big reward is sleep?&quot; One of Down
with the Furies' more interesting songs is &quot;Turnstile Girl,&quot; which
alternates from the slowly spooky to the jagged, with dark lyrics like
&quot;Split like bone / Stick like skin.&quot; That bass-driven punk found in
&quot;Forgiveness is a Curse&quot; makes its return on the instrumental &quot;Econoline.&quot;
This song too detracts from the overall sound Tizzy creates with the other
songs.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Day Duran Duran Finally Came to Town&quot; pleases mainly because it
is about a subject that I can relate to: the 80s. &quot;Slow syrup songs and
sticky synth licks / I had to have my pubescent fix / Throw merchandise and
memories into the mix / Who was your favorite? / Mine was Nick.&quot; Although
it is among the album's more memorable songs, Down with the Furies' strongest
track is the ever-evolving &quot;Half Step Century.&quot; The song is dark and
aggressive, involving fractured vocalism for the majority of the song. But with
just over a minute of the five-minute song remaining, it evolves into an airy
dream. The album ends with &quot;Fighting in the Bookstore,&quot; which has too
many tempo changes to count on one hand, and &quot;Shopping Car Joyride,&quot;
the most accessible of the 11 songs that makes reference to Husker Du.<br>
<br>
Down with the Furies is not terribly innovative for being released in 2001. It
has a very familiar sound that fans of Sleater-Kinney and That Dog will take to.
And I recommend it to fans of those bands.<br>
<br>

&quot;Down With the Furies&quot;<br>
A band with two female vocalists? That's not unusual, but when one of those
females is the drummer then it's safe to say the situation is a little unique.
The dual vox of bassist Jen Stavely and drummer Teri Morris provides the strong
&quot;grrrl&quot; foundation for this cacophonous little trio, even though the
powerhouse guitar work is provided by a male in the form of one Joel
Boultinghouse. The key to Tizzy is dissonance. They specialize in a fuzzy and
muddy guitar/bass/drums mix that bounces along in a happy yet haphazard pop
fashion. Stavely and Morris blend their voices in blissful harmony, juxtaposing
their sweet sounds against the noisy background with perfection. I have to say
my favorite tune (mainly because I can relate to the 80s subject matter) is The
Day Duran Duran Finally Came To Town , a messy little song which ironically does
not belie the slightest shred of influence from the clean and neat boys of
double Duran. Tizzy's teen angst is conveyed in a most optimistic fashion, and
perhaps that is why they seem to get under the skin so quickly. MISH MASH

Steeped in the stylistic sisterhood of Throwing Muses, Swisher and The Rondelles,
Tizzy pushes all the key femme-pop buttons. The Massachusetts-based trio’s
1999 promising, recently reissued debut Scary in Adulthood often bounces from
bashing punk to minor-key melancholy within a single verse. The sudden tempo
changes go a long way toward establishing the band’s technical proficiency,
but they’re frequently distracting. More impressive is the range of subject
matter: Targets include bumper-sticker ideologues, corporate color schemes and,
in &quot;The Underground Eats Its Own,&quot; the annoying way &quot;Movie stars
prove their hipness/Talking about bands between their tips on fitness.&quot;
Drummer Teri Morris and bassist Jen Stavely’s vocal banter is swift and sweet;
the two trade lines in similar but separate voices. Recently departed guitarist
Joel Boultinghouse’s short and bitter vocal take on &quot;Snowman&quot; is
more head-scratching than thought-provoking, but his tangent is a nice touch.
Down With the Furies has fewer memorable melodies than Scary in Adulthood , but
benefits from more complicated vocal arrangements. Once again, the pacing is all
over the place. &quot;Half Step Century&quot; mixes a riot grrrl sensibility
with loping interludes, while &quot;Work Ethic&quot; peaks with perky pop and
sinks when it slows. &quot;Turnstile Girl&quot; stands out by picking a mood
(sensual) and sticking to it. The lyrics address more standard fare, but they
resonate when the band defends teen-pop fans in &quot;The Day Duran Duran
Finally Came to Town&quot; (&quot;Who was your favorite? Mine was Nick / Slow
syrup songs and sticky synth licks / I had to have my pubescent fix&quot;) and
flirting with a friend in &quot;Shopping Cart Joyride&quot; (&quot;You
understand about me and Hüsker Dü&quot;).</font></p>

November 2001<br>
&quot;Down With the Furies&quot; (CD, Vital Cog, Rock/pop)<br>
Smart, cute but not cutesy, provocative, and totally entertaining. Tizzy had
already caught our attention on the basis of their last release which was strong
indeed. Down With the Furies picks up where the band left off, and is an even
stronger album in terms of focused songwriting, playing, and production. As was
the case with the band's last album, these tunes are part pop and part
progressive rock. The band consists of Jen Stavely (bass, vocals), Teri Morris
(drums, vocals), and Joel Boultinghouse (guitar). The vocals on this album are
wonderfully on target...and those heavenly harmonies ought to have pop fans
floating up into the clouds. Tunes like &quot;Reminders for the Reactive,&quot;
&quot;Rushing Positive,&quot; &quot;Work Ethic,&quot; &quot;Econoline,&quot; and
&quot;Shopping Cart Joyride&quot; give us cool rushes of spastic glee. This is a
fantastic and...for the time being anyway...obscure band that is worth seeking
out. GREAT goddamn stuff...! (Rating: 5++) (out of 6)</font><font size="+1"><br>

<p><font color="#FFFFCC">Tizzy’s “Scary In Adulthood”, the first of the
three releases reviewed here from Western Massachusetts’ ever-fertile Pioneer
Valley, is a snappy cocktail of pop hooks, delicious harmonies, riff-o-rama
guitars, and inventive drumming. Tizzy’s power-pop roots and fuzzed out mid-fi
sound create a sound equally reminiscent of Pavement and American Thighs-era
Veruca Salt. Jen Stavely shines on vocals, while Joel Boultinghouse’s guitar
work and Stavely’s nimble bass nicely complement Teri Morris’ consistently
inventive drumming. Their unique sound works best on the storming “Cut Down
Fight” and “A Quarter &amp; Counting”, the undeniably pretty “Green
&amp; White”, and the fuzzed-out chaos of “Snowman”. Too many nondescript
mid-paced tracks tend to bog down the middle of “Scary”, though. That said,
Tizzy displays plenty of talent and they’ve got their chops down cold – just
a couple of more rockers and one or two fewer mid-tempo songs are all that’s
keeping “Scary In Adulthood” from being a great little record.</font></p>

a punk-pop trio from Northampton, have spent the past seven years on the
well-traveled road to indie-rock respectability, slowly working their way up to
this, their first full-length, by touring behind half a dozen assorted singles
and EPs on labels like Pop Narcotic, Darla, and spinART. Scary in Adulthood
splits the difference between the feminist punk of Sleater-Kinney and the more
innocuous commercial power pop of Veruca Salt. The disc’s best tracks — the
raucous &quot; Cut Down Fight &quot; and the more melodic and contemplative
&quot; Charmed Life Girls &quot; — demonstrate the knack bassist Jen Stavely
and guitarist Joel Boultinghouse have for combining crisp female vocals with
distorted guitar sounds and lots of feedback; and drummer Teri Morris
contributes some pleasant background vocals. But the group’s limitations
surface on &quot; Bumper Sticker Town, &quot; a plodding and joyless indictment
of Northamptonites who view putting political bumper stickers on their cars as
some kind of rebellious act; the song is about as potent as a &quot; No Nukes
&quot; sticker on a brand new Saab. Tizzy have figured out how to get the grrrl-punk
sound without losing the infectious spirit that come with being a young and
restless indie-rock band. They just haven’t had enough practice filling a
full-length album to keep out the clunkers.<br>

&quot;Charmed Life Girls,&quot; &quot;I Hate Football,&quot; and &quot;The

readers like to read a bit more about the Riot Grrrls scene.&nbsp; That's a bit
difficult, 'cause there'</b></font>s <b>not
that much stuff available at the moment to review in our magazine.&nbsp; A lot
of bands are pulling themselves back from the scene or have disbanded
already.&nbsp; Maybe TIZZY is something for you.&nbsp; They hail from
Northampton,&nbsp; MA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The band members got together after playing
in several separate bands.&nbsp; With these separate bands they toured with
bands like BIKINI KILL,&nbsp; PHRANC and TSUNAMI (no not the metal
band!!!).&nbsp; Now they got together and formed TIZZY.&nbsp; TIZZY consists of
Jen Stavely on bass and vocals.&nbsp; Terri Morris on drums and vocals and Joel
Boultinghouse on guitar and vocals.&nbsp; The music they play can be described
best as a good mix of punk, rock and pop music. Think about the Riot Grrrls
sound and you come close.&nbsp; Twelve songs are on this forty minute
disc,&nbsp; which opens with a fast track called &quot;Cut Down
Fight&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Charmed Life Girls&quot; show us the more poppy side of
the band.&nbsp; But with songs like &quot;A Hand Grenade In A Hair
Salon&quot;,&nbsp; they sure know how to create a more heavy sound,&nbsp;
too.&nbsp; Same goes for the real girls song like &quot;I Hate
Football&quot;.&nbsp; If you're into this mix of pop, punk and rock, I suggest
you have a listen to &quot;Scary In Adulthood&quot;.&nbsp; It won't do you any
harm.&nbsp; Sometimes, the vocals do sound a bit like Deborah Harry
(BLONDIE).&nbsp; Except for &quot;Snowman&quot;,&nbsp; which has distorted
vocals by the only male member of the band.&nbsp; The band already played live
with bands like MAGNAPOP,&nbsp; HALF JAPANESE and TRIBE 8.</b></font></p>

&quot;The future is bright after all and its' name is Tizzy. Not since D. Boon,
Mike Watt, and George Hurley set the standard for power trios with the Minutemen
in the early 80s has any band come up with a better combination of great songs,
raw yet melodic riffing, and creative intensity that Tizzy on &quot;Scary in
Adulthood.&quot; Every song on the 12 song, 38 minute CD is great, and great
fun. The band shifts tempos with great ease. Keep making great music and working
us into a Tizzy.&quot; -- Music Revue</b></font></p>

&quot;…Well on their way to kicking some ass. Their sound is pure rock-n-roll
in a contradiction of styles that become a great release of energy. The album
ends with &quot;A Quarter and Counting.&quot; This song is why rock-n-roll was
invented. One of the Top Ten local CDs of 1999.&quot; -- The

&quot;…. another sonic homerun. The disc is launched with heavy power chords
minced through fuzzed guitars and tempos that change like mood swings. Stavely
reminds us that angst is still cool if it is real, not forced by some trend. A
throwback to the true alternative sounds of bands like the Throwing Muses,
Pavement, and the Pixies, this band counters its' retro influences with clever,
vibrant songwriting. One of the top ten local CDs of 1999.&quot; -- The

&quot;This record is loaded with hooks and it is easy to see why this album is
so much fun. But Stavely's unique voice brings a certain importance to standard
girl topics. The more you pay attention to the lines around the hooks, you see
they have lots to say.&quot; -- Detours (FL)</font></b></p>

&quot;They were excellent. The dual female vocals were superb and overall they
put on an energetic show. The songs are true pop with a of punk and definite

&quot;Performing a strange mix of punk and pop, the trio come off raw and
unpretentious. As far as screaming goes, Stavely seldom needs it to show her
passion. She shows her anger in a more disciplined fashion. Emotional delivery
works within the framework of their songs captivating melodies. Here's a band
with a DIY attitude, and who still pack a powerful punch.&quot; -- The
