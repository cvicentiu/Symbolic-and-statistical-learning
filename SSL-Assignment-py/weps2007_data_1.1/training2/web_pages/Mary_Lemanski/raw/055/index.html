<font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">If you judge a disc by it's cover, you might think Shane Ashley's My Emotions is little more than drippy love songs, pitifully lamenting lost romance.  Thankfully, this disc has much more to offer than an excuse to reach for the kleenex box.  It just so happens that Ashley has a firm grip on passionate songs that move and groove with empathetic power, While these tunes may deal with lost love, they do it with a sense of strength and resolve.
Lovers We Can Never Be sets the tone with it's slow groove and Latin guitar feel.  It's  a world pop blend which touches on Sade and Lisa Stansfield, always relying on the absolute dominance of the rhythm. The renewed attitude of I Can Love battles with the hardened-heart stance of Hurts 2 Much 2 Love. In the end, Ashley has reminded us that this love thing is usually unpredictable at best, with multiple layers of joy and hurt rolled into one. MISH MASH MANDATE: Cry tough.</font>

Reviewed by Sheldon T. Nunn<br><br>As we all know, jazz comes in many textures, flavors, colors, and can even be camouflaged at times.  In addition, what is often meant to be jazz, can and may be lost in translation.  The release "My Emotions" is one of those "camouflages" I have spoken about. This is a compilation colored and flavored with pop & R&B influences. If one wants a fresh new vocalist to get acquainted with, Shane Ashley may be the voice that suits your listening palate.</font>

<font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">The lines separating R&B from Jazz have become increasingly diluted over the last decade, and Shane Ashley's musical style adds yet another flavorful shade of grey.  Sounding like a mix of Sade and Anita Baker, this funky single mom shows she's capable of making it BIG if she should decide to take her career in that direction.  I for one applaud Shane for keeping her priorities straight while pursuing her musical interests. Shane's aptly-titled CD "My Emotions" showcases her writing, arranging, and performance prowess while at the same time serving as an avenue of expression of her past.</font>

I was wrong though, this is actually a really interesting album vocally and musically.  "Lovers We Can Never Be" is a standout and even gets a remix at the end of the album, while songs like "Hurts 2 Much 2 Love" and "In This World" had me entranced.  I have to admit that this is a welcome change of pace for everyone.</font>

Shane is from my hometown of San Jose, CA and quite honestly upon hearing this excellent Jazz/R&B album, it made me want to jump on a plane and fly back to book a show with her, just to say I had.  This is one extremely talented vocalist and this CD shows it.  She writes, composes, and arranges her own music.  Drawing on influences from Teena Marie, Phyllis Hyman, and George Benson, Ashley's sound is highly original and limitless. On the CD cover, it marks the songs that radio music directors and reviewers should listen to, it lists 5 songs. Well I disagree….I think every song should be played, this album is that good. - Michael Sullivan.</font>

Singer, composer, arranger, musical journeywoman - and single mom - Shane Ashley pours a lifetime of experiences, good and bad, into My Emotions, her splendid solo debut.  A stylish blend of contemporary jazz, R&B and pop, Ashley's music reflects the best in all those genres, while escaping all their snares.  Confidently accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, Shane gives heartfelt voice to true tales of love and loss with class and sass, avoiding the histrionic melismas that soooo many singers sadly feel obliged to trot out in the post-Whitney era.  Producer Peter Stanley wisely resists the temptation to gild this lily, keeping it real with understated polish and punch.  My Emotions is a mature work in the most positive sense of the term. Bravo.</font>

          <p><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">Rising star Shane Ashley embodies 
            all that is good and fine about contemporary vocal jazz: a profoundly 
            personal sense of deep soul, an gift for creating truly ear-catching 
            melodies and harmonies, and a tasteful avoidance of the cliches that 
            so often drag the genre down into cheesiness. From stem to stern, 
            <i>My Emotions</i> is a warm, touching, excellent document of a woman’s 
            life and loves. </font></p>
          <p><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">All the songs here were either 
            composed by Ashley or co-composed with multi-instrumentalist Peter 
            Stanley. It’s clear that these two folks have worked together long 
            enough to develop a magnificent rapport. Thankfully, Stanley uses 
            realistic keyboard textures and real instruments to evade the low-budget 
            electronic sounds typical of so much contemporary jazz and R&amp;B. 
            Instead of hogging the show, Stanley puts his formidable gifts into 
            full support of Ms. Ashley’s compelling voice. And what a voice it 
            is, consistently listenable and oh-so comforting. Shane Ashley wraps 
            herself around the audience, practically sitting in its collective 
            lap as she shares her innermost thoughts. </font></p>
          <p><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">By all rights, “Lovers We Can 
            Never Be” should already be a national jazz-radio hit. The ear is 
            grabbed right from the first acoustic guitar notes, and Ashley seriously 
            pours out the soul. “Pray”, written for Ashley’s daughter, simply 
            oozes love of God and family. Stanley reaches into the funk bag for 
            “I Can Love”, while the ultra-low bass of “If I Can’t Have You” draws 
            that tune closer to contemporary R&amp;B. “Heaven With You” is a bit 
            reminiscent of the slow, bluesy acoustic lopes that Eric Clapton has 
            favored for the past decade. </font></p>
          <p><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2">All in all there’s not a dog 
            to choose from here; each song is a pristine little gem. Many thanks 
            to Ms. Ashley for sharing her emotions on disc. This one is an absolute 
            must-hear.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

            released the first solo album via her own production company. Peter 
            Stanley's smart production and slick instrumentation skirts the dreaded 
            "smooth jazz" tag and keeps the vibe fresh throughout "My Emotions," 
            recalling younger acts like Brandy or Destiny's Child, balanced with 
            a jazzy maturity a la Shirley Bassey.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pop/R&amp;B

            mood. The strongest cuts here, "Lovers We Can Never Be" and "Don't 
            Let Go of a Good Thing," also exude a funky flavor redolent of the 
            genre's masters, like Chaka Khan, Tina Turner, and Stevie Wonder.</font></p>

            Ashley's widespread popularity may be based on her suave, sophisticated 
            vocals as she sings with the maturity, wisdom, ease and sass acquired 
            by experience. Her voice has touches of Phyllis Hyman with jazz contemporaries, 
            Diane Reeves and Anita Baker. My Emotions, is a stunning collection 
            of artistic creativity from this singer/songwriter. Throughout, Ashley 
            never ceases to deliver on the eleven dynamic original compositions, 
            including a masterful, upbeat, remix version of the first cut, &quot;Lovers 
            We Can Never Be&quot;. The musicianship on this recording is stellar! 
            Producer, Peter Stanley, intuitively complements the beauty, sensitivity, 
            heart and soul of Ashley's distinctive vocal style with instrumental 
            interpretation. My Emotion, a long awaited debut release, is undoubtedly 
            Ashley's brightest moment as a jazz vocalist. It is a passionate recording 
            filled with themes of hope, love and intimacy from the uptempo, &quot;Pray&quot;, 
            to the mid-tempo, &quot;If I Can't Have You&quot;, that illustrate 
            in bright bold colors. Absolutely delightful!</font> </o:p></p>

            what point did soul become R&amp;B? And when did the R&amp;B of the 
            '30s and '40s atrophy into the R&amp;B of the early '80s? At some 
            undetermined point, the bass and drums were illegally removed from 
            the mix, leaving a gaping hole in the music. Shane Ashley is modestly 
            trying to fill that hole -- not so much with a monster rhythm section, 
            but with smooth, well-written songs that you can sing along to. With 
            R&amp;B growing more and more innocuous, it's good to see that performers 
            like Ashley can still get a few vital emotions across. In "Lovers 
            We Can Never Be", Ashley laments the loss of a philandering would-be 
            suitor, cutting across a chorus of cascading guitars and a funky bass 
            line with all the confidence and nonchalance of Sadé. Indeed, nine 
            of the disc's ten tracks -- all of which were written or co-written 
            by Ashley herself -- are concerned with starting a relationship, losing 
            a lover or missing a lover. The exception is "I Can Love" which is 
            about the strength of Mrs. Ashley's love. The backing musicians here 
            aren't quite up to the Muscle Shoals standard, but that's a secondary 
            issue; the point of <i>My Emotions</i> is to make clear that Ashley 
            still has her groove on. </font></o:p></p>
