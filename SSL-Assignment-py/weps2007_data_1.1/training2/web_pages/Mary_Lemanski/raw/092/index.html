<tt>Man, this is basically the second anniversary of the shizz. I just now thought of that while I was typing this. Happy Birthday Shizz :) <br> We have some shows happening that will be out of this world. Tomorrow night will be a shizz new years at none other then the Hollywood Alley. This should be plenty of fun for all. <br> Thursday night at the brickhouse will be the Ballad of, with Andrew Lockwood and Jim Miles. This should be a cool night for sure. <br> I fortunately don't have to work on the first WOOOHOOOOOOO!!!!!

<tt>Hopefully Santa hooked all you guys up for the holidays, I got a sweater which will be perfect for this super cold weather we have right now. I had a great christmas and got to bed nice and early so I wouldn't be so tired when I got to work. Even thought I got plenty of sleep I still feel really tired. Must have been that crazy workout this morning. (I am trying to get back into shape so I can maintain my youthly figure). Hope to see you all at the new years eve show at the hollywood alley, should be some good times. Be safe during the holidays and don't drink and drive :)

<tt>Getting closer to the end of the year, we got some great shows coming up, and I have no idea what they are at this very moment but If you look on the calendar you will definitely see them. Things are looking better each day. I am really getting stoked on getting into some new things, I will keep that pretty much too myself, all I need to do is start blabbering about stuff coming up and then I will jinx it and that is never good. So to everyone I hope you all have a merry christmas and a wonderful new year. I will try and post a few more times before the year is out. TTFN

<tt>Tonight is the modified benefit show at none other then the modified, should be great. I saw AAA lastnight at borders bookstore and they rocked as usual. I really love that band, I think they just kick so much ass. I am still booking thursday nights at the brickhouse, and it is slowly starting to gain momentum. I have to say the brickhouse has been really cool to me so far and I feel as though they truly want to help out our scene as much as anyone. <br> I have other stuff coming up but can't really say because if I do, I will jinx it, and it won't happen. Thanks to you guys who keep reading this, I don't post on here as much, but should be on here quite a bit more. Currently I am sitting at a coffee shop trying to look cool drinking chai but it never works. It seems like whenever I am trying to act cool, that is when I make the biggest ass out of myself. I have since given up on it. I don't try to be cool anymore, but I still make an ass out myself quite a bit, so I am not sure where I am going with this but for anyone who wants to know. I am not cool, sometimes I am cold and freezing, and sometimes I am so hot I feel like I am gonna die from heatstroke but I am never cool. Except when I am by myself but nobody ever gets to see it except me. <br> GOD, what the hell did I just write? You guys should be happy I don't write in here on a daily basis. <br> Not yet anyways :)

<tt>I had so much food, I about exploded. I had a great weekend I saw so many bands it was horribly exciting. Some highlights were, an acoustic set by the World Class Thugs at the Ol Brickhouse on Thanksgiving. XOXOXO, and PeachCake at the modified for and electronic friday night at the modified. Ruby Lee at Nita's and Rum Tenor at a house party in Tempe on saturday and Wonderful Wednesday, Telegraph and the Album Leaf at the modified lastnight. <br> Now that I look back, I saw a ton of bands and this was definitely a great weekend. <br> I have noticed lately I have been getting approached more and more about the shizz and people wanting to be on it, or on the next comp. I will drafting some requirements soon, and will start getting all my shit together. Once that is done I will then focus on the next comp, I know I am already behind on getting started but, for those interested enough in reading this. You will just have to deal with it :) <br> I just had lunch, I am rested and feel great. Now all I need is some servants who will do my bidding!!

<tt>Only a couple of days till the big Turkey feast. It's about this time of year I feel sorry for all the vegans and vegetarians out there who don't know how wonderful it is to eat a dead bird. I have some friends who are going to deep fry their turkey, I think some will be eating a ham, I will be eating good old fashioned turkey with tons of cranberry sauce and stuffing. Oh god I haven't eaten lunch yet and I am making myself so freakin hungry right now. <br> Tomorrow night Okkervile River will be the highlight of the evening as The Winners and John G get to open up for them. Thursday is not only Thanksgiving but also an acoustic set with Wonderful Wednesday and A Winner, so if your bored and have nothing to do thursday night come check it out. <br> Have a happy thanksgiving and if you drink don't drive, likewise if you drive don't drink.

<tt>It's been awhile, damn, I have been so busy lately. I am slowly wearing myself thinner and thinner and thinner. Pretty soon I am going to need an assistant. Does anyone want to volunteer? I have alot of plans I just need the time to follow through with them. <br> been to some awesome shows and am hoping to see some more. Yeeeehawwww <br> No I am not crazy, I am just going through a few minor changes right now. <br> And remember EVERY thursday at the brickhouse a shizz band will be rocking your pants off.

<tt>I get down on myself sometimes and question what I do and what I am doing untill I get an email or an instant message from someone saying how much they really dig the local scene. I was talking with someone who bought a shizz comp from the minibosses in Virginia and he told me how much he dug the local scene out here and that he wished he lived in a place with as cool a local scene as Arizona. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Since I have been out here I have only heard complaints about it, and today it finally got validated by someone on the other side of the country. I am a very happy man today, so nobody better piss me off :) <br> Another shizz night in the bag, I had alot of fun, there were some cool costumes, I dug mario and luigi which was totally cool. More nights to come.

It's almost 4:30 and I a still in my PJ's :) <br> Tonight is Halloween so get out your costumes and let's party. There is a ton of parties going on tonight and maybe I will see some of you out there.

<tt>I have had a most bizarre week, but I am still busier then usual here at work. The work load is getting bigger, I guess it's a good thing becuase I still have a job. <br> This past friday was an amazing show, I got to see missouri loves company for the first time, very awesome indeed, as well as irradio which is from san diego. IHYWYP never fails to make every performance I have seen outstanding. The Minibosses, what can I say about The Minibosses. I have to say this is one of the best nights I have had in a long time. I had so much fun watching those guys, aaron was a drunk drunk man but he was still able to stand and play at the sametime so it still rocked :) <br> This thursday will be a most awesome night at the brickhouse. Minibosses, VinFiz, The Budget Sinatra, Underliner, and Missouri Loves Company. This should be a great night, it's a costume party, so bring all your friends and let's make this a night to be talked about for a longtime.

<tt>I have been so busy with work lately it has been insane, I have been working alot of 10 and 11 hour days and tomorrow and friday I am planning on pulling 12. I guess that is the price you pay for being paid salary. <br> I have been a little out of the loop lately because of work and have been trying to keep up with everything. Oct 30th is coming up and I am really excited about this show at the brickhouse. It will be one that won't be forgot. <br> I better get back to work but I will try to update this more than I have been lately.

<tt>Tonight the budget sinatra takes the stage with fatigo and some other bands. Isn't that nice, I don't even know the names of the other bands. I am horrible lately. Actually the other bands are Goodnight from Twilight and Second Gravity which are all playing tonight at Nita's Hideaway, I nice venue which I have seen some really cool shows at. <br> First Friday's last week was a blast, I saw quite a few people and had such a great time, it seems to get bigger and bigger everytime I go. <br> I missed the Hella show which I heard was so awesome, I was lame and stayed home to recooperate and save some energy for the remainder of this week. Playing tonight, working tomorrow night at the modified, and then recording all weekend, should be lots of fun, but very exhausting. <br> I can't think of anything else to say so I am just gonna stop typing.

<tt>I sadly had to take HFC off of the main site and in their place have put up a link to IHYWYP a one man band that not only has very catchy music but provides one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen. This is not a band you can simply say "oh I think I might have seen him before", you either have or you haven't. I could go on and on but I won't for the sake of boring you. <br> I am slowly realizing that this website is actually becoming known on a national level. I am surprised that arizona picked up on it, but hey I guess this is some good stuff. <br> I have been so tired lately, but I probably say that all the time, I keep falling asleep and waking up on my couch, and am starting to wonder why I paid so much money for my bed when I don't really use it that much.<br> This friday is the first friday of the month, which means ARTWALK!!! <br> I love the artwalk and will be there walking the streets hopefully very drunk. Enjoying music at Fate and at the Paisley Violin. Wowza!!!

<tt>I hate it when I don't post on a regular basis, I feel empty inside. I worked at the modified on sunday and in the beginning of the night things started to go bad, instead of 4 bands there was gonna be six, and the first band was late and it was just getting a little stressful, but then I saw this band called <a href="http://www.beyondanalog.com">Beyond Analog</a> and they totally rocked, they reminded me a little bit of the Mars Volta. Totally made my night. <br> Well The Shizz is going to be hosting thursday nights at the Ol' Brickhouse in downtown Phoenix starting Oct 30th. I will have more info soon, but this is going to be big! Let's all come out and have a great time with this!

<tt>Another day, another $1.23 <br> Well let's see, wednesday was awesome for the finale of the Shizz Presents.... at the emerald lounge, I caused a little bit of feedback but other than that it was awesome. I had alot of fun and am thankful for everyone that came out. <br> I am starving and writing this while waiting for friends so I can go EEEAATT!!!!!! I am gnawing on my arm as I type this. <br> I have gained alot more respect for Leslie who runs modified, that woman puts up with more crap than I think most people are ever aware of and she doesn't complain about a thing. <br> I am totally just throwing out random thoughts while I wait to go eat so please forgive me. <br> The shizz got a review in the NewTimes check this week, definitely check it out. I can't say I agree with the review (not that it was bad) but I don't think he listened to the same comp we did. It's kind of weird, like he played it in the background while he was doing something else and everyonce in awhile would remember he was reviewing the cd. But I guess I am a little protective of it, of course, and that's my review of his review <br> Tonight the Winners take the stage at Borders at the Biltmore at 9pm as well tons of great bands including HFC are playing at the modified tonight. This should be a great show. Damn I am hungry. When are they getting here!!!

<tt>I started this website over two years ago as a means to put links up to the local bands that I totally dug. It's amazing how much this website has grown way beyond my wildest imagination at the time. I am greatful to everyone who has helped support the website and all the wonderful bands. I guess I am feeling all sentimental and crap right now. Don't take advantage of my emotional instability or you will feel the wrath of the Shizz come down upon you like a lion on a harmless midget. <br> God I am in weird mood today, I swear I am not on any drugs, maybe it's sleep depravation. I don't know, it might be the reeses puffs cereal diet I have been on. That cereal is so good but I believe it has been effecting me lately. <br> The Budget Sinatra played a show at the Borders Bookstore friday. It was a blast, and I don't know if this is supposed to be a secret or not, but the Lovely Ms. Trixie Delicious is now engaged. Who would have ever thought :) <br> Lot's of cool shows this week, HFC is gonna be playing there last show friday at the modified, everyone please come out and support them for their last show. Wednesday is the Last of the Shizz Presents at the Emerald Lounge so definitely check it out as well (if your not doing anything too important of course) <br> I guess I better get back to work

<tt>It's always fun going out and checking out shows, drinking some brew, talking to girls, drinking some more brew, hanging out with friends, drinking some more brew and then realizing (at 1 a.m.) that you have to be to work at 7 in the morning the next day. This is something that has been happening to me for awhile now and lastnight was no exception. The Emerald Lounge, which happens to be where I was lastnight was one of the best shows we have had so far in the last month I have been doing the shizz presents there. Ahead of girl who came out to play, got the crowd pumping, as braeburn showed everyone that Joes' drums really can fit on the stage, they rocked as well and got everyone ready for the Rockers of the evening Boomin Betty. I still have that song "Do ya wanna touch me, do ya wanna touch me there" stuck in my head (as long as nobody here at work hears me singing it to myself I think I will be okay). It was a great night, too bad I couldn't sleep in, but that's life I guess. <br> Tonight a band I have been wanting to see for awhile is playing at the paperheart, they are called Arms of the Sun and I have only heard a couple of there songs but they sound good and from what I have been told these guys are awesome. (I feel like I use the word awesome too much and am going to look into using a better word, like intrigueing or awe inspiring, I don't know) <br> I need more sleep.

<tt>Wow, today is a sad day indeed. JR Cash (a.k.a. Johnny) died early this morning, this guy was a living legend and the 6 decades of his music will surely be remembered. I actually was just getting into Johnny Cash recently and started realizing what a great songwriter he was. <br> In other news, I am sick as a dog, I meant to go to a show at jugheads and when I got him I just collapsed, I am only here at work because I would rather be sick and at work then without a job and well a few days later. <br> There are so many shows tonight, Minibosses at the Hollywood Alley, Dalek at the modified, some rawkin at Joes' grotto, Del Toros and The Vinegar Sting at the Emerald Lounge. There is pretty much something for everyone tonight.

<tt>The day before the 2nd anniversary of 9/11. Not that I am all sentimental about that, but I do remember that day very well and that is something I won't forget. Not that I was there, but seeing it as it happened on tv and coming in to work seeing everyone all freaked out and other people thinking it was a big joke. Wow it was just crazy. Anyways back to better stuff...<br> Tonight VinFiz and RumTenor are taking the stage at the blessed Emerald Lounge on 7th ave and Mcdowell this place has become my new favorite place to hang out, I really like the dankness that it eminates and the dirty looking women that walk through those doors. It's awesome, but still not as awesome as the Hollywood Alley, and if I ever say otherwise you can hit me (not very hard mind you, but enough to bring me back to my senses)<br> It should be a great show and I encourage all you to come out tonight and check itout. <br> Have fun and use protection!

<tt>Wow, I haven't posted in awhile I guess, well it was a crazy weekend and I am still recooperating from the shizzfest last weekend. Whew I still can't stop thinking about that show, it was soo awesome. oh the memories... <br>This past weekend was amazing, friday night there were tons of shows going on, the Budget Sinatra played two shows that night one at chasers with Arms of the Sun and at the Brickhouse in Downtown Phoenix, I really liked both places but I will say the Brickhouse has amazing acoustics and the stage is awesome. It was alot of fun. <br>Saturday AAA opened up for The Life and Times and it was an awesome show, Allen Epley was the nicest guy and they were amazing to watch, AAA totally rocked (as usual). I haven't seen them play a full set in a long time and am really glad I got to see them. <br>Anyways, let's see, we have our weekly wednesday as the shizz presents VinFiz and RumTenor at the emerald lounge this should be alot of fun (as usual). Be sure to come out and say hi or grab a beer and enjoy some good music.

<tt>The Site was down for a few days because the powersupply on the server went out. Unfortunately this isn't a regular desktop computer that you can just plop any kind of powersupply into so it took Lucas a little while to the right part. I apologize for the inconvenience and we are working on plans to not let this happen again. Thank you for your patience.<br> The Shizz CD Release show was amazing. I can't thank everyone enough for making it such a great success, there was music, food, and plenty of beverage. It was truly awesome. All the bands were great and Leslie from the Modified was wonderful for letting us hold the event there. I want to thank all the bands that played, all the people that helped out and came out to the show. There are way to many names for me to list so I am not even going to start but I just want you all to know it was awesome and plan on doing this again for the next comp.

I am wore out but I need to start stocking up on hotdogs and condiments before next saturday. Aug 30th will the greatest show in the history of the world, okay maybe not the greatest, but it's definitely going to be up there at least for me :) <br> I am working again tonight and will finally get to see Missouri Loves Company, a band that I have heard alot of good stuff about. They will be playing tonight at the modified. <br> Tonight is also Braeburn, Posture, and The hair we like to consider life like, playing at the Paper Heart.

<tt>It's getting closer and closer to the big show. I am really getting excited about the showcase, unfortunately there is some bad news to come along with the good. Lulu In Hollywood has sadly disbanded. There are no juicy details, it just seems that people grow apart sometimes and unfortunately this happened to Lulu in Hollywood. I always thought they were a great band and I am glad that I got to play with them. Hopefully we will some good stuff come out of these guys in the future.<br> Friday I saw ahead of a girl at Fate which is right next to Modified, I meant to see HotFoughtCold, but I got caught up in stuff and didn't really make it. Sorry HFC, I hope you forgive me.<br> Sunday I saw Brodie Hubbard, The Squares, and The Chemistry Set. Very good show, Brodie Acoustirocked the house and the squares even though they ran into some technical difficulties sounded really cool, I wish they would have had more vocals but that is just my opinion, the Chemistry Set was pretty cool, I liked how they used a vocoder for their vocals. Very cool. <br> WOOOHOOOOOOOO

<tt>Damn, I missed a really good show AND practice lastnight. I got off of work early and decided to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. I get a call at 6:20pm from brian asking me why I am not at practice. I fall back asleep and don't wake back up till 5:47 this morning and was late for work this morning. I missed the MachJockeys, Fatigo, and Vinfiz show. I know it was a great time. AAAAAHHHHH <br> Tomorrow will be a couple of cool shows, Ahead of a Girl will be playing at Fate which is Johnny's (from the lucky dragon's) new place next to the modified. And HillbilleyDevilSpeak, HotFoughtCold, Replicator and Battle Scar Tarantula, will be at the modified, so I will be walking back and forth to each show.

<tt>Okay, this is what I get for going to a cool show, noooooo sleeeeep. It's hard to stay off the crack when your having such a great time. I went to the Paperheart lastnight and saw some coolio musica. First off was Boomin Betty, they rocked the stage with some catchy songs and cool harmonies. The drummer (Cameo Hill) is one of the nicest people I have ever met and has one of the most awesome voices. Next up was none other than Rachel Jacobs whose stage presence was amazing she had everyones attention and her music was amazing. Not just a good singer with good lyrics, but a good guitarist too. Headlining the evening was Ahead of a Girl, Jen is an amazing guitarist with an awesome jazz influence. The chords she was pulling and the licks she was playing were totally cool. The Drummer, like Jen has a real jazzy feel to her playing which adds to their sound considerably, I saw the drummer (Jessie) a few years before in a band called the anti-organics where she sang and played drums then too. Very cool stuff, we all hung out and Morgan was taking pictures the whole time. <br> Tonight is VinFiz, MachJockies and Fatigo, this should be an awesome show. After seeing the MachJockies on Sunday, you guys are totally missing out if you don't go to this show. And like Gil always says you can Mach the Jock, but you can't Jock the Mach.........or something. :)

<tt>I had a crazy week last week, I had the company pager the whole time so everytime I wanted to go to a show or wanted to go to sleep the pager would go off and I would I have to go into work. It's all over now I have handed over the pager to a fellow employee who can suffer in my place for awhile, Muahahahahahaha <br> Last night I was at the Emerald Lounge and met the guy who does booking over there. His name is Brian and he really dug the comp, I guess he is friends with Larry Mack from KUPD and will be giving him a copy. I am pretty stoked about the whole thing. <br> Tomorrow night Ahead of a Girl will be playing with Boomin Betty and Rachel Jacobs from New York. This should be a totally cool show. I have seen Cameo Hill perform solo and she is awesome. Cameo is on drums for Boomin Betty and I really want to check this out.<br> Now the nerves are starting to kick in on the shizz cd release show, this should kick some major ass, but I am still getting nervous. :)

<tt>So I missed the deerhoof show lastnight, what a bummer. I have the company pager and had to work lastnight, totally sucks but I guess this is what pays my bills so I can't complain too much. I heard it rocked, but I wasn't there to verify it. The board is just as crazy as usual, we got 1.9 million hits last month. It's pretty exciting and with the cd release coming, it's getting hectic but still fun. I have nothing left to say, I am bored, but I have alot of work to do, so I guess it's more laziness than anything. If nobody reads this anymore let me know so I can stop posting to this. Bleccchh

<tt>Well, I survived Las Vegas, just barely this time. Ben, Jesse and I left saturday morning but before we did we stopped at McDonalds and got some McGriddles. I didn't have one but Ben couldn't stop talking about them for the rest of the day, on how good they were. We started on our journey and listened to old Metallica and talked about the good ol' day of when they didn't suck. Jesse missed the exit to vegas so we went a different route, but we missed the Hoover Dam and missed all of that traffic. We got to Las Vegas and I started losing money quick, we got free drinks for gambling so I guess that made up for it. We found out where the minibosses were supposed to play so we moved the van over to the spot, unloaded and that is where all the major drinking began. The Minibosses set was awesome, Lkelley looked very super ultra hot, Aaron was wearing a miniskirt and all the minibosses rawked the house. The sound was awesome there and it was awesome. We all went back to aarons apartement got our stuff together and then, Matt, Kristin, Nate and I went to check out the Bellagio, Casino Royale, and some others I think, but can't remember. We all had alot of fun but coming back was a total drag. I was sooo tired and blech. But I am alive and have survived the minibosses playing in Vegas for the 3rd time.

<tt>I had a pretty good weekend, I worked on some new music, I moved a ton of bricks with the Lipfert brothers, Jim, and Leslie. We had alot of fun moving bricks, that sounds pretty sad, but it's true. I saw the acoustic singer Cameo Hill, I put a link up to her in the other links on the main page, she was awesome. I got to see Second Hand Emotion, which was pretty cool if you are into that kind of thing. The Keyboardist was in an amazing retro 80's outfit, was very cool. <br> Last night I saw Osama Bin Sars, very artcore. They had themes of a shark infested ocean, with a lifeguard, shark, and helpless victim. The Wrangler brutts were a good show to see, they were really cool and I dug there stuff. <br> I can't stop listening to the redponyclock and IHYWYP both completely different but I love listening to them both. I guess I am just sick I guess. :)<br> Tomorrow night is gonna be a good show at the Paperheart with The Budget Sinatra, Underliner and The Harps who are from Tucson.

<tt>I worked at the modified lastnight and got to meet some really cool bands, some of the hardest punk bands seem to be the nicest people, at least the touring ones are. I am totally tired. <br> Tonight Fatigo will be playing along with some others at the PaperHeart Gallery in Phoenix. It should be cool, and since it's within walking distance. Have I mentioned how tired I am.<br> Aug 30th, mark this on your calendar!!! It will be the shizzfest that will rock everyones socks off!! Tons of bands, food and lots of unmentionables, anyways this show will be the highlight of the year and if you miss it, you will surely live a miserable life.

<tt> Last night going to the argo was awesome I got to see a band called <a href="http://www.thesharpease.com">The Sharp Ease</a> and they were pretty good. The singer was so animated. She kept showing her crotch to everyone and sang a song about how she liked her ass getting licked. I must say it was pretty punk rock. Then The Minibosses played an awesome set, we were all dying of heat by the end of the night, but it was worth it. The girls from the Sharp Ease were really nice and totally cool. Definitely a good night.

<tt>It has definitely been a crazy fun filled week. I was fortunate enough to be the roadie for the minibosses, hauling their gear and helping them get setup for a couple of performances they did in San Francisco and Oakland CA. We all had a great time and made it back safely. Everyone survived my snoring, Fred survived seeing Ben's manhood, we survived being apart of a homicidal maniacs rampage in oakland, kristin survived driving all night to get back to phoenix at 5 in the morn, the band survived being on live tv for their first time and are alive to tell about. Everyone survived me being grumpy when we were searching for a place to eat for breakfast, we all survived Fred peeing in a ziplock bag so we wouldn't have to pullover. I guess we are all survivors in our own right.<br> The shizz was mentioned in the newtimes, if you want to read the article, you can pick up a copy or read it online by going too <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2003-07-17/music.html/1/index.html">http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2003-07-17/music.html/1/index.html</a> <br>Tonight is supposed to be a kick ass show at the argo.

<tt>Another show at the Emerald Lounge, I left at 1:00am and woke up at 5:00am so I could make it to work by 6. I am sooooooo tired.  Fatigo totally rocked, Freds mom was there. I got to meet her and she was really nice, and it was really cool listening to Fred talk to his mom in French. I thought that was awesome. I could keep going on and on about Freds mom but I won't. <br> World Class Thugs were amazing, They were in the clothes that made them feel the most comfortable I guess. With Dale wearing pimp daddy clothes from the 70's, and Jim wearing a shriners hat. The drummer must really be into dairy products because he was dressed as a cow, and I don't mean a hefty woman, he had an utter and everything. <br> anyways.........<br> The Minibosses will be in san fran later this week so you won't see me for awhile cause I will be their roadie on the trip.

I truly think it was one of the best shows I have been to for awhile, and lately I have been going to alot of shows. Other than you smell like an ashtray when you leave I really am starting to dig the Emerald Lounge, it is a nice place and the people seem pretty cool so far. <br> Tonight Mike from Fatigo is playing at Undicci Undicci, and Sunday World Class Thugs are playing with Fatigo and the very Reclusive Donald from the Winners and the Budget Sinatra will be playing an acoustic set to open it all up.<br> Have fun, have a great weekend, and remember, if your going to drink don't driveand if your going drive don't drink :)

<tt>Well, I missed out on the show at the Hollywood Alley lastnight, sorry Chad. Instead I went and saw a band near my place at the emerald lounge called The Lactating Beats. Very retro rock, I think it was the psychedelic colors they had too that might of had something to do with it. Tonight is the show of all shows, Minibosses, Lifelike Hair, and Vin-Fiz. Let's all try to support these guys tonight. I am pretty stoked to see them all. Anyone looking to get a shizz Comp should go to stinkweeds now, before they sell out, or go to the show tonight. :)

<tt>I went to stinkweeds and got the new Mars Volta album (which is awesome) and saw the shizz comp there. I was really excited seeing it there, and I asked Morgan the girl who was working their how many they had sold. She said they had just put them up that morning and she didn't think they had sold any. She then asked if I had heard it, and that I should because it is really good. I smiled and said I had already heard it. <br> I had a good birthday I celebrated it at Hollywood alley as I usually do and had a great time. Thanks to all the people who showed up. I even got to see Mike's little brothers who I haven't seen in years. It's amazing that they are all grown up now. I remember when they were all just little bratty kids. They still kind of are, but now they are all old enough to vote and most of them are old enough to drink.

<tt>Well, a new month, a new lease on life. I have almost got all the bands their cd's. Only one left, people seem to be pretty stoked about the cd, as well as myself. I was listening to it constantly, now I want to create another one. I feel like this one, even though it was hard getting everything and everyone together was alot of fun in the long run and would love to do another. It would of course be completeley different music by different bands, I don't want to have the same bands two albums in a row, I want to show diversity not narrow mindedness. I am starting to see myself getting ready to start babbling about a whole bunch of nonsensicles so I won't. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, love your mother, she is the only one you got, and if you don't have a mother, cry somewhere and think about how much it really doesn't matter. <br> Have a great weekend, go to the Hollywood Alley Sunday night, I have been there every year for the past 4 years now around this time and I just love it.

<tt>Dizzamn, I was a total loser in high school, well I was a loser in junior high and elementary too. I had braces, I wore glasses and had highwaters. It was very excruciating at times getting picked on. It was not fun at all. Now I am older, I no longer have braces and don't really get picked on by anyone unless I bring it upon myself. It's amazing how things change. I met this girl who is the same age as me, and she was missing most of her teeth, she had 4 kids, and looked like she was balding or was in some sort of haircutting accident. I felt kinda bad and she told me she used to be a cheerleader in high school, and how popular she used to be. I think she was trying to relive her past by telling me how cool she WAS. I couldn't help but feel some kind of justice had been served. That is a horrible thing to say, but nobody know's how much I used to get picked on back then, by jocks and what have you.

<tt>Allright, you might have noticed just a tadbit of a change on the shizz lately. The Minibosses are now on the shizz messageboard. It has been crazy, the traffice has increased and so far everything seems to be totally cool. The minibossies are definitely a breed of their own, and it's weird realizing that alot of them are not from arizona, which is totally cool. I have been to some cool shows and have met some really cool people but I am at work and gotta get my butt in gear before I get yelled at :)

<tt>Man, Friday was hella cool, Vin-Fiz Rawked the stage. Marty is usually the frontman, but Mike kinda held that spot on this particular evening and I got to look at the band from a different perspective. Fatigo, as usual did a most superb job of entertaining the crowd. Then After Any Accident hit the stage, I didn't get to see most of there set unfortunately because I was in a deep discussion with John DelaCruz, but what I heard was most beautiful to me ears and I cry knowing that I missed it. (okay I was exagerating here people, I didn't cry, it was more of a soft weeping). <br> so anyways....<br> LifeLikeHair hit the stage they played some cool original stuff, they played some EOTM and I thought they were playing a VinFiz song untill marty said it was Fugazi. <br> Saturday was booty shakin at Graham Central Station, there were alot of booties out there being shaked, Mike was cage dancing for awhile and the rest of us just hooped and hollered. It was pretty fun and they have some damn good burritos and nachos there too.

I have gone through stalkers, surgeries, fallouts, incestivals, compilations, breakups, defcon, and some other stuff I am too lazy to mention. Would one think I am content having done all of this?

<tt>Damn, it's already June!! I got back finally from my trip to the North West. Jesse and I drove up to Seattle and hung out in San Fran and Portland. It was totally awesome, we saw boobs, beer, books, B.O., bees, and even a few bums. I don't have all day to give all the details of the trip but. We went to san fran and met a crazy guy who hooked us up with some parking on this huge ass incline, when I tried to park on the street sideways, I thought the van was gonna rollover. We got pretty stinky not showering, We went to the coolest strip bar in the world while we were in portland. We saw an awesome band called Detachement Kit from Chicago, went to the largest bookstore I have ever been to in my life called Powells bookstore. Got harrassed by many a bum in portland. Jesse got stung by a bee while we were driving to Seattle. We saw where Kurt Cobain used to live under a bridge in Aberdeen, we burned our feet in the sand because it was soo hot while we were on a beach in Washington (yes, washington). I snored alot and Jesse kept kicking me. Jesse almost had us killed with his mad driving skills. We went to the aquarium in Seattle and hung out there for the day. I ate some russian food, which wasn't bad, went to the Crocodile in Seattle and heard a crappy band which I forgot the name of. We slept in the van most of the way and were really stinky, on our way back we got a shower a truckstop and it was the best shower I ever had for $5.  We went through L.A. and the smog was so bad we could barely see. A lady gave us an apple with roofies in it, and we barely made it back alive.<br> Hope you guys had a good week too!!<br> Dismemberment Plan Tonight at the Modified TONIGHT!!!!

I brought some friends and we all hung out to see them at this place called FatCats off of grand a couple of blocks south of the bikini lounge. It was really cool and I had a great time. Sunday I saw a band called "now we're cooking with gas" or something like that and they were a blues ish type band but were really really good. The guitarist had such an awesome tone that I haven't heard in years locally. This was over at the Hollywood Alley one of the cooler places I haven't hung out in for awhile. I love that place so much.<br> I am leaving for Seattle this Friday and will be gone for about 10 days. It should be alot of fun and hopefully the website doesn't blow up during that time.

I was working on new music drinking being merry and then woke up slobbering all over myself on the couch at 3 in the morning wondering where I was. It was a good thing I was home or I would have really had some issues. <br> I missed out on some really cool shows the last couple of weeks, seems like april is a big month for freakin birthdays. I can't believe how many birthday's and weddings have been going on this month. Very crazy. <br> Tomorrow night You Knighted Nations is playing at the modified, should be a very cool show, I will be there as long as I am not passed out slobbering all over my guitar again (it's very doubtful I will do that again, but you never know).<br> It feels good to write in the journal again, I should do this more often :)

I love First Friday's and highly recommend it to anyone who digs not only the art but the music too. There was a big crowd at Holga's and saw alot of people I hadn't seen in a long time. It was great. <br> Saturday The Budget Sinatra played at a friends graduation party. It was alot of fun, and we got to see one of franks friends with dog poop all over his overalls. He threatened to break my nose after I said something about Texas, but I told him that wouldn't be a good idea, I didn't realize he was from Texas. He left me alone for the most part after that, and could barely walk by the time we left. Sunday was Mike Montoya's birthday which was cool, I slept most of the day so was kind of out of it when I got to the alley.

<tt>Today is another day of war and chaos in the middle east. I must say that I have been pretty busy lately, I just built a dresser for my room, and feel a sense of accomplishment now everytime I put clothes or take clothes out of it. <br> I have really been out of the loop lately, and have been told that by some, I have been really busy and have MOST of the stuff for the comp done, It will be done soon. <br> I really hate hearing bad news and it's a terrible thing when you hear that a band that has been around for so long have one of it's member die. Ian McKay passed away from heart complications. I heard it on the radio and freaked out. It's like one of those things where you remember where you were when the space shuttle blew up. In case any of you don't know Ian McKay was in such notable bands as Minor Threat and Fugazi.

<tt>Ok, so after reading the message board there is probably going to be some mass hysteria because there have been comments about all the songs getting lost. This is not true and I am not gonna post anything on the messageboard about it, I am just gonna let people go crazy for awhile. <br> Last night was an awesome show at the emerald lounge. If any of you have heard of a band called Seven Story Mountain will also know how awesome of a band they were. Lance from Seven Story is currently in a side project called Grounded Heat, I saw them play lastnight and even though they had some technical difficulties, I think they really rocked, I urge you all to see them next wednesday at the emerald lounge again. <br> That's all for now untill I think of something witty to say.

<tt>Man oh man alive, I survived the rocky point spring break weekend!<br> Even if I didn't want to look at boobs all weekend, I wouldn't have been able to keep them away. They were everywhere. There was alot of beer, a friend of mine got thrown in mexican jail, there was very little if any talk of war with Iraq, lots of fun. The tacos were awesome. Unfortunately, all this fun came with a price. It's known by some people as Montezuma's Revenge. This is the term by which some people (myself included) pay back for all the fun they have in mexico. Was it worth feeling deathly sick and peeing out of my butt for a good day or two? Hell YES!!  And more than likely I will be back again next year for more!!  But next time I will not drink the water, although I don't remember doing that, there is alot of stuff I did there that I don't remember :)

<tt>Okay, it has been awhile since I last wrote, I have been very busy lately and have been in a totally different plane of existence, not in bad way it's just different. I saw a band lastnight called crash car star at the modified and I am realizing how much I hate bands that can't be original. I liked Jimmy Eat World's music but I don't like listening to every other band playing their songs but changing the words. (I will get off my soapbox now) <br> We are at war, I am not going to express my political views because that is not relevant, but this is a sad time to be in right now. <br> I am going to Rocky Point this weekend, we shall see if they let me back into the U.S. after I am there. Someone said I look kind of middle eastern and that I might have issues getting back. I never in my whole life thought that I looked middle eastern, sounds like there was a change in the matrix. <br> Well kids, don't do drugs, stay in school and do what your parents tell you and maybe santa will bring you something for christmas other than a lump of coal.

<tt>This past weekend was spent at the art detour and getting into my new apartement. On Friday The Budget Sinatra played at Holga's studio which I had alot of fun with later we saw a band called Shark Pants from tucson play which I thought was really cool, very punk. Afterwards Jesse and I walked all over getting drunk in front of Leslie from the Modified and having her introduce strange hot women too us. Later we moved on to other galleries and came back for more wine from Leslie, we then walked to my new place (because I couldn't drive) and hung out at the party there untill the cops came. I had a blast.<br> Saturday at holga's I got to see the Minibosses for the first time I think since Vegas, it totally rocked and they played soooooo much better than they did last year at holga's. Next was some belly dancing and the wonderful Fatigo with the new addition of Jesse on the trumpet. <br> This is a pretty full week again, tomorrow The Budget Sinatra is playing at the New Nita's Hideaway with ex members of The Make Up, Friday Vin-Fiz is playing at the Borders in Scottsdale. Saturday, Braeburn, Vin-Fiz, The Budget Sinatra, and possibly "The Ponies" will be playing at the paperheart. Sunday, You Knighted Nations will be playing with Amendmant 18 and Hollar at the Modified. Monday, will be The Locust and Moving Units with Other Voices at the Modified as well. <br> WHEW!!!

<tt>Whoa, I have been busy moving into the innercity this week. Next I get to do some painting this weekend which I am kind of excited about doing, all this is happening during the great Art Detour this weekend in phoenix. Many (if not all) of the local galleries open up for the weekend and will have bands, dj's belly dancers, spoken word, food and drink and not to mention alot of art. <br> Checkout the calendar to see some of the bands playing and a link to the art detour. Tonight Budget Sinatra is playing at Holga's studio. Tomorrow Braeburn and the Minibosses and Fatigo are playing at Holga's as well, which should be a fun evening. Also, for any of those interested my new apartement complex is near the paperheart and we will be having a downtown detour party, there will be a keg and donations will be happily accepted. Email me for directions if you need some :)<br> Hope to see you at the art detour!

<tt>Last night was an amazing show at the argo, I thought it was awesome, I don't remember the name of the first band, but the Levines came on next and got the crowd going in the middle of their set by throwing a plasma bowl in a microwave outside of the argo. It smelled funny and made cool lights in the microwave for awhile before someone unplugged it. I Hate You When Your Pregnant came on next. That guy is amazing, I think him and Ben Baraldi would make a great Duo. Next up was Neptune from Massachusetts (damn I hope I spelled that right) These guys played instruments that were all made from scrap metal. Totally cool, very industrial :) <br> I apologize to anyone I offended for notnosting about the argo show in my journal, I didn't realize people would get upset and start harrassing me. Sometimes I feel like I need a restraining order on certain bearded men with glasses. Speaking of restraining order as I left the show there were 3 cop cars outside the argo waiting to bust underage drinkers, I am glad I wasn't underage. I was a lamo and left because I was gonna get up at 3:30 in the morning and go to the paperheart but woke up at 5:15 and barely made it to work. So I can't tell you how wonderful the minibosses were.

<tt>Wow, I had a great weekend, I don't want to go into any details because then you will all get jealous at how great mine was and how bad yours was :) <br> Let's see, I saw the mason jar for the first time in years and not a whole lot has changed. it's a little bit nicer but not much. <br> Saturday went to the priceless inn, it's actually a cool place but they had no beer selection, the p.a. sucked ass, but I got really drunk and didn't really care by the end of the night, I had so much fun I almost puked. I woke up the next morning not knowing where I was, with one of the worst hangovers ever. It was AWESOME, I lost my keys, then found them in my jacket pocket, drove home took about a 45 minute shower and just sat there in the tub contemplating death. By the end of the day I was finally back to normal. Never again will I drink budweiser. They say it's the king of beers, but that stuff will kill you, or at least make you suffer so much you will want to die.

The second thing is that the shizz has for the first time ever has gotten over 100,000 hits in a single month. This is so awesome, I owe alot of it to John Lipfert, Jesse Maxwell, and all the others who are addicted to the message board such as myself. :) <br> A full weekend ahead and I am scared I won't survive it. <br> Tonight HotFoughtCold is playing at longwongs, AAA is playing at the mason jar, saturday is a show at the argo as well as the infamous priceless inn with The Budget Sinatra, Ninevolt, and AAA, I can't remember all the other crap that's going on but it's on the messageboard AND the calendar.

<tt>Man, I went to the alley after practice lastnight with Jesse to get some pizza. It was a wednesday night and it was filled with hotgirls, I couldn't believe my lucky charms, it was surreal. It seemed like a friday night but it was only wednesday, and then I saw this punk/reggae band come up and saw that this is what hot girls listen too. I have been listening to the wrong music!! I am gonna go to Zia and get the latest Blink 182/Jimmy Eat World/Sum 41 cd's and conform so that I may get hot women. Or do I just need to wear a baseball cap and a blink 182 t-shirt? <br> I guess we shall see.

Check this out if you can, or die trying. <br> The Comp is coming along. Next time I give Montoya a deadline it will be two weeks ahead of everyone else.

<tt>Saturday, I saw one of the craziest shows ever at the lucky dragon. Transgojobot was there and played a cool, two man set. Next up was the Levines which played a good set, but the crazy stuff was when the Stab City Slit Wrists from Flagstaff got on stage, they had more guitar and bass cabinets than God. They were a mixture of Black Sabbath and The Sex Pistols. It was awesome, and it was so loud I could feel my rectum shaking from the bass. After that After Any Accident played what I thought was an awesome set. I forgot the name of the song but it goes "You've got it made, your getting paid" that's one of my favs next to "Freshly Bled Cow" which I don't think they play anymore. I learned about the origins of the last song they played "Fire in the Hall" which is pretty cool to know. Last but not least was The Necronauts, those guys have a really great sound, they need to buy tuners but other than that, they were really good.<br> Sunday I went to the phoenix art museum. I got to see some stuff from Picasso, Monet, Goya, and even Van Gogh. It was a total experience and I didn't know people dressed up so nice to go the freaking thing. I think I was the only one in a t-shirt and sneakers. <br> Hot Fought Cold this friday at long wongs, and the budget sinatra with AAA, and ninevolt at the Priceless inn. Woohoooooooooooo

If you are saying you are bored and have nothing to do, you are either not reading this or dumb. <br> I went to the alley lastnight and saw a few bands, I don't remember the name of the first band but they were young (under 21) and were a cool blend of punk and speed metal. Pretty cool, Ross told me that before they started playing they were trying to describe their influences to him and asked Ross if he had ever heard of a band called Social Distortion, I thought that was kinda funny. The next band that came up was BrotherLush who I had found out about by chance. They all seemed really cool, and were really solid. I meant to checkout the whole show but Jesse wanted to go see the Girls Gone Wild over at Graham central station.<br> This was so bizarre, 10 bucks to get in, now in theory you would think this would be everymans dream, but for every woman that was there I would say there was about 30 guys. I got to see plenty of flesh but it would have been so much easier to just go to a strip bar. I think I am too old for that crap anymore, or maybe not :)

The headliners of the evening The Bangs rocked everyone out with their Olympia Washington songs of hopeful despair. I had alot of fun at that show and later Dana and I went to Ben's just to hang out and talk about it. That is how cool the show was. <br> Friday was another cool show at the modified. Fatigo opened up the evening and played a new song, (or at least one I had never heard before), Vin-Fiz rocked the stage and we got to see Mike Devine sing for the first time. Liberty School threw down some mean jams while someone threw rose petals all over the place. The Winners ended the evening in a drunken stupor and allegedly did pretty good. The feedback is that everything went well, so I will go with that. <br> This week there should be some good stuff going on, I know friday is a big night at the Hollywood Alley, with EOTM, World Class Thugs, Braeburn, and Fatigo.

<tt>Wow, I am writing in this thing everyday now. I amaze myself sometimes. I have noticed I am becoming more paranoid with people. People who I know have no idea about the message board or my journal will say stuff to me that blows me away. I said on the message board that I haven't had any hot chicks in my van, yesterday a girl that I work with just out of the blue (who is also hot by the way) said that she has been in my van. I didn't know what to say except repeat what she said and say "Yes, you have been in my van" and that was it! She started talking about other random nonsensical girl stuff and I was freaked out for the rest of the conversation. I know she doesn't check out the message board, but that is weird, and I didn't count her as being a chick I had in the van because it was just to go to lunch and we didn't do anything. Why did she randomly just tell me that she had been in my van? I have no idea. I think I am just being weird, plus I have nothing else to talk about. <br> Acoustic Mayhem is this sunday at the Hollyweird Alley, check it out and rock out acoustic style with the likes of Brodie Hubbard, Lonna, Matt Felix and more...........

He was INSANE!!! A band from Texas called The Bends played, good old school punk, pretty cool. I had to leave cause I wasn't feeling to good I wish I could have seen AAA, those guys always rock.<br> As I was leaving the party I went to give something to Marty and I shut the door to my van while the engine was on. This generally wouldn't be a big deal but there is a safety feature in the van that locks all the doors automatically when the engine is turned on. I locked myself out of my van, with the engine on. Marty called triple A (the car service not the band) it took about 40 minutes for them to show up so we waited out in the cold till they got there. Once the guy was there it took 10 seconds to unlock the van, I was on my way home by 11:58 and I got to see the fireworks in tempe while on the road. Although not the best, it will probably be the most memorable.
