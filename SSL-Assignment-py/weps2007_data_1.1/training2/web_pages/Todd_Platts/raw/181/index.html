						<p><P><span class="headline">President lays out Iraq plan</span></P><i><span class="bodytext">By JOHN HILTON/The Sentinel, Carlisle, Pa.</span></i><P><span class="bodytext">CARLISLE, Pa. -- President George W. Bush made a firm commitment to finish the job in Iraq Monday while also outlining a detailed exit strategy amid declining public support for the war.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">In a prime-time speech at the U.S. Army War College, the president provided details of a five-point plan to transfer power in Iraq June 30. The 35-minute address is the first of a series of speeches Bush will give in the coming weeks as he attempts to rally public support for the war.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">With the U.S. death toll at about 800 soldiers, Bush warned that the violence and chaos will not end soon. He made no promises to bring troops home, saying the United States would keep its troop level at the current 138,000 "as long as necessary."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">And "if they need more troops, I will send them," Bush said sternly. "We will do all that is necessary by measured force or by overwhelming force to ensure a stable Iraq."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Hundreds in the audience</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Bush spoke to about 450 guests in Thorpe gymnasium. The guest list was determined by the White House, and war college students were given priority, said Carlisle Barracks spokeswoman Lt. Col. Merideth Bucher</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; U.S. Rep. Todd Platts, R-19; Carlisle Mayor Kirk Wilson, and Dickinson College President William Durden headed a short list of invited guests.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card watched the Bush address from a darkened corner along a running track high atop the gym.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Five steps to Democracy<TABLE align="RIGHT" BORDER="0" WIDTH="281" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="6"><TR><TD valign=top><IMG border="0" src="/content/articles/2004/08/19/stories/top_stories/9ynews195.jpg"><span class="cutline"><BR><FONT COLOR="#800040">Great team effort by the Carlisle staff to advance the president's visit and then to cover it, including sharing stories with other Lee papers on an AM cycle, even though The Sentinel is a PM paper. -- DAVID STOEFFLER




 






























</span></TD></TR></TABLE></span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Bush outlined five steps that he said would help Iraq achieve democracy and freedom: transferring authority to a sovereign new Iraqi government on June 30, helping establish security in areas still gripped by chaos, urging broader international support, reconstructing the country and setting up national elections.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"Completing the five steps to Iraqi elected self-government will not be easy," Bush said. "There is likely to be violence before the transfer of sovereignty and after the transfer of sovereignty."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Bush's speech coincided with the unveiling of a new U.N. resolution by the United States and Britain endorsing the June 30 handover of political power in Iraq and authorizing a U.S.-led multinational force to keep the peace.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Although U.S. forces will remain a military force in Iraq following the June 30 transfer, Bush repeatedly shot down any notion he plans on a long "occupation" in the war-torn country. A recent poll said 82 percent of Iraqis want U.S. troops to leave.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I sent American troops to Iraq to defend our security, not to stay as an occupying power," he said. "I sent American troops to Iraq to make its people free, not to make them American. Iraqis will write their own history and find their own way."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The draft U.N. resolution urges nations to send troops for an international force - something the administration is anxious to see, with American troops stretched thin.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Other nations have not been stepping forward to make new pledges of military or humanitarian help. Still, Bush said, "Despite past disagreements, most nations have indicated strong support for the success of a free Iraq, and I am confident they will share in the responsibility of assuring that success."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Interim government</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is expected to put forward the names of the interim government this week. In addition to a president, two vice presidents and a prime minister, 26 Iraqi ministers will oversee government departments ranging from health to justice to defense.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The new government - to be advised by a national council that will be chosen in July by Iraqis - will exercise full sovereignty until national elections are held in January, Bush said. In what is being billed as the first true election in the history of the country, Iraqis will choose a transitional national assembly.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The assembly will draft a new constitution, which will be presented to the Iraqi people in a referendum scheduled for fall 2005, Bush said.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Many functions of government already have been transferred to the Iraqis, Bush said. Twelve government ministries are under their direct control.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">For example, the ministry of education has trained more than 30,000 teachers and supervisors for the schools of a new Iraq.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Bush noted the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib, saying the prison that was a symbol of death and torture under Saddam Hussein "became a symbol of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonored our country and disregarded our values."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">He vowed to destroy Abu Ghraib and build a new prison if Iraqi authorities give their consent.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Poll numbers down</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The speech comes at a pivotal time for Bush's drive for re-election as well as for Iraq's future. Five months before election day, his approval ratings have bottomed out, dragged down by the turmoil in Iraq.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The University of Pennsylvania's National Annenberg Election Survey, released Monday, found 64 percent of those surveyed did not believe Bush had a clear plan for Iraq.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">His job approval in polls by ABC News-Washington Post and CNN-USA Today-Gallup was 47 percent, near his lowest in those polls.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">In a CBS News poll released Monday, Bush's job approval was at 41 percent, with 52 percent disapproving.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The trip marked Bush's 28th visit to Pennsylvania since taking office and his third to the midstate this year. Bush lost Pennsylvania in 2000 and the state is expected to be a key battleground as he seeks re-election this year.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Platts, a staunch supporter of the war in Iraq, said he was pleased with Bush's remarks.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"It was very important for the president to lay out for the American people what our direct strategy is in Iraq," the congressman said. "Success in Iraq is a critical aspect of the global war on terrorism."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext"><b>The five-point plan</b></span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Here is President George W. Bush's five-point plan to Iraqi self-governance. The five points are accompanied by selected comments from the president during his speech Monday:</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Working with the United Nations in naming interim government leaders.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"By keeping our promise on June 30th, the coalition will demonstrate that we have no interest in occupation. And full sovereignty will give Iraqis a direct interest in the success of their own government.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Iraqis will know that when they build a school or repair a bridge, they are not working for the Coalition Provisional Authority, they are working for themselves."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Eliminating security threats and bolstering Iraqi police forces.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"Five Iraqi army battalions are in the field now, with another eight battalions to join them by July 1. The eventual goal is an Iraqi army of 35,000 soldiers in 27 battalions fully prepared to defend their country."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Rebuilding the country by focusing on reconstructing infrastructure.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"Our coalition has already helped Iraqis to rebuild schools and refurbish hospitals and health clinics, repair bridges, upgrade the electrical grid and modernize the communication system."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Broadening international support, primarily through a U.N. resolution that will detail the June 30 handover of power to a new Iraqi government and outline how much say Iraqis will have over armed forces in their country.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">A national election to be held in January.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"A United Nations team headed by Carina Perelli is now in Iraq helping form an independent election commission that will oversee an orderly, accurate national election. In that election, the Iraqi people will choose a transitional national assembly, the first freely elected, truly representative national governing body in Iraq's history."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The Associated Press contributed to this story.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext"><b>Carlisle tunes in to president</b></span></P><P><span class="bodytext">By TIFFANY PAKKALA/The Sentinel</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Pedestrians walked with upturned faces and drivers poked their heads out their windows as five massive helicopters descended just after 7 p.m. Monday.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The helicopters carried President George W. Bush, some of his staff, Secret Service agents and the White House press corps to Army War College at Carlisle Barracks.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">And within an hour area businesses and watering holes switched their televisions from the usual sports programming to Bush's prime-time speech at the war college.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"Everybody's been talking about it," said Dan Miller, manager of the Gingerbread Man downtown, in the minutes leading up to the speech. "This is as big as it gets."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">By 8 p.m. at Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 477, a television's volume was turned all the way up as the president's speech began.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Some patrons at the East High Street post sat mesmerized, listening carefully to the entire speech, while others soon returned to their drinks and conversation.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I think he's trying to tell everybody that he's keeping a focus ... that he does have a program," said David Martin of Boiling Springs, who served in Korea in the 1960s.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"There's one way to fight a war: Go in and do it," he later added. "What he's trying to do is win hearts and minds."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">President praised</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Sitting nearby, Augie Dietz of Carlisle pointed to Bush's image and said, "As long as that man's in office, I can go home and sleep at night and have no worries."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">After the president stressed that America's efforts in Iraq will continue, Dietz said: "He's not going to give in. He's going to fight to the end. I think that's the way it should be."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Norm and Cathy Walters of Boiling Springs also watched the speech at the VFW. Cathy Walters said Bush's words were "uplifting."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Her husband added, "With self-rule, (Iraqis) are going to have to start standing on their own legs. That's a nice bit of information for our troops, so they'll know they can get on with their lives soon."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Back at the Gingerbread Man, one pair of customers had a complaint about the president's visit. The couple "was annoyed that their last ballroom dancing class at the war college was canceled" because of Bush's visit, Miller said. "But they understood why."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Big night for cops</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Another customer told him "every deputy sheriff in Cumberland and Dauphin counties (had) to be within a mile" of the military post.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Local law enforcement officers were stationed on all the roads around Carlisle Barracks.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Middlesex Township police blocked off both sides of Post Road on the east side of the installation more than an hour before the president's entourage of helicopters landed, and North Middleton Township police added security to the already highly guarded south entrance on Claremont Road.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Carlisle police were stationed at the post's front entrance on Route 11 while Cumberland county's special response team was stationed on site at the barracks.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">By 9 p.m. Carlisle already seemed to be on its way back to "normal," without any major traffic jams as Carlisle Barracks emptied.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Dispatchers for Carlisle police and Cumberland County communications center reported their evenings had been very quiet.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext"><b>Crowd protests with 'joyful noise'</b></span></P><P><span class="bodytext">By LINDA FRANZ/The Sentinel</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Hundreds of people lined North Hanover Street near the entrance to the Army War College Monday evening to peacefully protest President Bush's policies.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The impromptu protest, organized after Bush's plans to visit Carlisle were announced Friday, drew diverse groups. Carrying signs and shouting slogans such as "Impeach Bush now," protesters encouraged people driving by to honk their horns in support.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">More than a dozen Bush supporters also showed up - but only one argument got loud enough to attract police, who quickly ended the confrontation between two Vietnam War veterans who had served with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. One is a Bush supporter - and the other isn't.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Otherwise the gathering took on a party atmosphere.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"It's kind of like making a joyful noise here," said the Rev. Sandra Mackie, a Lutheran pastor from Dillsburg.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I preach and teach peacemaking," she said. "I'm just here to voice my opinion that war is not the answer."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Teenagers Sophia and Natalia Van Doren of Carlisle calmly played their violins in the midst of the crowd.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I'm very happy to see so many people on such short notice," said their mother, Alaina Van Doren.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Signs evident</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Most of the protesters carried handmade signs with messages such as "Support the Troops, Bring Them Home Now," and "Not With Our Sons and Daughters."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The president flew into the post by helicopter and would not have had an opportunity to see the signs, but that didn't dampen the demonstrators' enthusiasm.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Carlisle resident Ken Albright attended with his wife to raise his voice in protest.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I think Bush has lied to us big time," he said. "The legitimacy of the war is completely in question."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Carrying a sign that read "We've Lost the Moral High Ground," Harrisburg resident Karen Lutz attended with her golden retriever.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I just so strongly oppose what this administration has done to the American people. We had the good will of the world with us on Sept. 11 and the president squandered it," Lutz said. "This administration had no real mandate and they've taken us to the darkest place in our history."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">She said protesters must get organized in November and bring other people with them to the polls to defeat Bush.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Victoria Sams and Susan Rose were part of a group from Dickinson College in Carlisle protesting against Bush and the war.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"We heard that Bush was coming here" and wanted to lend support to the protest effort, said Sams, a college employee. She called Bush's presidency "one of the most destructive administrations in my life."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Members of the "Carlisle Peace College," a group that mounts monthly protests at the war college, planned the 7 p.m. protest. Leader Ben Price said people began arriving shortly after 5 for Monday's protest.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"We do support the troops but we don't want them to come home in body bags," he said.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Richard Burrill, a peace college supporter from Stoverstown in York County, said he wants troops to come home.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"We're in protest to the president of the United States to come here to push his war," he said. "There's no way he can rebuild our reputation around the world."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Mary Ann Evans of West Pennsboro Township, who attended with her two sons and a friend, said "We made the effort to go to Washington and New York because we think Bush is wrong and the war is wrong. Certainly we're going to come to Carlisle to let him know what we think.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"He is lying. We're in a war and people are being killed."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Perry teens protest</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Seven Perry County teens, all students or graduates of Newport High School, called for the president's ouster at the polls.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"We don't want Bush to be in office anymore," said Alea Drain, 17. "A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">One of the signs the teens carried said "Register Green, Vote Democratic."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"The liberals need to come together for one (candidate)," said Tim Harper, 18, a senior at Newport High School. "Anyone would be better than what we have now. All the mistakes he's made -- when I'm 30 or 40, I'm going to be paying for it."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Joan and Bill Freeman traveled from Shippensburg to protest. "We've been against the war from the beginning. There weren't convincing reasons why we went to war," Bill Freeman said.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Instead, the United Nations should have been allowed to act, he said. "We didn't find any weapons of mass destruction; we're getting lots killed. We're making lots of terrorists."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">The country was "taken to war by a president who didn't receive the majority of votes in the country."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">They support president</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">About 15 to 20 Bush supporters showed up with signs sporting slogans such as "PA is Bush Country."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">John D. Stouffer of Enola said Bush's emphasis on homeland security impresses him.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"He said he wanted Osama dead or alive," Stouffer said.</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">At a time of crisis, you want someone to take action right away, he added. "You've got to protect your homeland."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Ron Murray of Lebanon carried signs that said "Support Our Troops" and "Deport Anti-War Protesters."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">"I want to keep this country safe and free for my grandbabies and my children," Murray said. "I care that this country stays as safe as it was when I was growing up."</span></P><P><span class="bodytext">Murray was willing to back up his views. He was one of the two Vietnam veterans involved in the shouting match near the war college entrance.</span></P></p>
