The only problem I see is this time of year most people's schedules are pretty hectic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leeleesmini</div><div class="date">Nov 26th, 2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i was thinking about having it in the spring so that the weather is nice and i have more time to plan...is that cool??!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bentley/cooper</div><div class="date">Nov 27th, 2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:)  :red: Spring sounds like a good idea. There are probably 15 or so Minis in the York area, but the hard part is going to be tracking down everyone &amp; letting them know about the event. As Cristo mentioned in another thread there are only a few of us on this web site. I'm sure between those of us on here we can find a few of the others. Keep in touch. I would be happy to help put something together. :)</div></div><hr />

 :red:  :) Hey sugarman, welcome to the York Mini family! I think I have seen Perky once or twice around town. I see in your profile that you work for a congressman. Is it Todd Platts? I've been a freind of the family for many years. Keep in touch. :)</div></div><hr />

Hey, Sugarman and Perky... good to see you got here after what I understand were <br />
some registration glitches.  I'd like to participate too if my schedule allows.  <br />
Happy Motoring to all in the York/Lancaster/Hburg area :D</div></div><hr />

 Thanks for the welcome...Yes, I am on Todd Patts staff....I think I saw you motoring around York.  It's great to be part of the Mini family in the area.  Todd's brother also has a Mini....light blue/black top. :yellow:</div></div><hr />

 :red:  :)  Cool! I had heard Mark was driving a Mini. Mark &amp; I have been freinds for close to 30 years. Let him know about our Mini gathering plans this spring &amp; maybe he can round up some Mini folks from Lancaster county as well.</div></div><hr />
