      Effective Members of Congress?</b></span></p>

    <p class="PrintableContent">Gary Quigley <a href="mailto:gquigley@cvschools.org">gquigley@cvschools.org</a><br>
      <br>
      I used the Power Index to rank my Senators from PA (Specter and Santorum) 
      and my Congressman Tim Holden(D) along with my students' Congressman, Todd 
      Platts(R).</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent"> When using the Power Index, the category for 
      exposure was left to your own discretion. I wanted something my students 
      could use so I created a system to measure exposure using the web. For each 
      legislator, I went to three sites.... Washington Post.com., New York Times.com., 
      and CNN.com. In the Post, you can search a name for the last week in the 
      news. For each 4 hits, I gave 1 point. Then at the Times site, you can search 
      the Times for the last month. For each 4 hits, I gave 1 point. My thinking 
      is that in the Post, names are more frequent where as in the Times, they 
      may not cover Washington in as detail as the Post. Thus 1 point for every 
      4 hits although one is a week and the other a month. Lastly I wanted to 
      look at the News branch of the Web so I used CNN.com. I searched each name 
      in CNN.com only, not<br>
      the whole web. For every 30 hits, I assigned 1 point. I added all these 
      points together a used this number in the exposure category. I realized 
      these numbers were very high (up to 40 points) compared to the high score 
      of 5 for each category in the other areas AND that news about a Congressman 
      isn't always welcomed but Name in the press can be better than no press 
      at all in these matters. </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent"> Using the Power Index<br>
      In the Senate - Arlen Specter has 28 pts<br>
      Rick Santorum's 21 pts<br>
      Bill Frist 41 pts<br>
      Tom Daschle 64 pts</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Using other Power ratings on the web, these rankings 
      were very<br>
      consistent..... Frist and Daschle were very low using only the Power<br>
      Rating because their lack of committee leadership positions but their<br>
      exposure moved them to the top.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent"> Using the Power Index<br>
      In the House - Todd Platts (PA) - 12 points<br>
      Tim Holden (PA) - 0 points<br>
      Denny Hastert - 44 points<br>
      Dick Gephardt - 56 point (exposure backfired because of his announcing Presidential 
      run - a lot of exposure = power?)</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">I adapted the Power Index to use in my classes. 
      I teach 12th grade American Government in a semester time frame. We are 
      just an overview course so time is vital. I structured the Power Index for 
      my seniors because I want to use this assignment as an introduction to their 
      Representatives and Senators. When they get this assignment, they will know 
      a little about leadership but not a lot. That's why I structured the index 
      so much. They still have to find all the info on a Webquest, but I help 
      them in the evaluation of the Info. I also wanted them to get more familiar 
      with voting records. I added a category of Party Support and Presidential 
      Support. This forces the students to look at the voting records and synthesize 
      the Power? / Good Soldier mentality of<br>
      their Representatives. Do their Representatives support (if the same Party) 
      their President or if the opposite Party are they consistently opposed? 
      These may not be valued in measuring power, but they are areas that I wanted 
      to incorporate into my class.<br>

    <p class="PrintableContent">Lynn Gresser <a href="mailto:Lynn.Gresser@anoka.k12.mn.us">Lynn.Gresser@anoka.k12.mn.us</a></p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">My House Representative is Jim Ramstad, a Republican 
      first elected in 1990. He represents the 3rd Congressional District which 
      is made-up of cities to the north and west of Minneapolis. His district 
      includes parts of at least two counties and multiple school districts. Small 
      parts of his district are &quot;all built up&quot; and have been for a number 
      of years. Much of his district includes cities with undeveloped space, growing 
      almost faster than the cities can handle. The number and complexity of issues 
      facing city and county governments continues to expand. </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Redistricting, after the census, made a difference 
      in the shape of most metro districts. <br>
      A web site you provided allowed me to print a city by city map of the 3rd 
      District. Ramstad's district includes constituents from some of the most 
      wealthy (and white) parts of the metro area. In other parts of his district, 
      the number of free and reduced school lunch counts continues to grow and 
      affordable, decent rental housing is difficult to find. Significant disparity, 
      on a multitude of topics, is reflective of his district.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Reading &quot;The Task for Learners&quot; and 
      &quot;The Process&quot; sections of the student materials entitled: WebQuest: 
      How Influential is Your Member of Congress? overwhelmed me. I think students 
      would be as well. Success with the activity requires understanding the task, 
      finding required information on the sites provided, and determining whether 
      the information found matches the questions asked. The activity requires 
      sophisticated, higher level reading and writing abilities as well as task 
      and time management. Skilled, motivated students who excel at research and 
      application tasks would be best served by breaking down the assignment into 
      more manageable chunks.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">I don't think this activity will work well with 
      either lower level or &quot;regular&quot; groups of students. With significant 
      modification and a much reduced assignment, these two groups of students 
      could work with limited parts of this activity and not all at once.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Congressional Power Index results:</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">1. majority party member: 3<br>
      2. formal party leadership: 0<br>
      3. chairs a big five comm. / ranking member: 0<br>
      4. chairs other comm. / ranking member: 0<br>
      5. chairs a subcommittee: 1 (see below)<br>
      6. seniority: 2 <br>
      7. margin of victory: 2 (I'm guessing, could be a 3)<br>
      8. campaign funds on hand ? see below<br>
      9. exposure in national press: 1 see below<br>
      TOTAL: 9</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">5. Ramstad serves on the Ways and Means Committee 
      and on two of its subcommittees, Health and Trade. He co-chairs the bipartisan 
      House Law Enforcement and Medical Technology Caucuses.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">8. I'm not sure what &quot;campaign funds on hand&quot; 
      means. The only financial information I was able to find online includes 
      these 2001-02 figures, reported 11/25/02:<br>
      receipts $2,040,613<br>
      spent $ 761,949<br>
      cash on hand $ 923,755<br>
      debts $ 17,792</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">9. Ramstad's national press exposure is hard to 
      measure without doing an exhaustive online search. Instead,I looked at legislative 
      work reported at home but of national concern as well. Some of these issues 
      include anti-crime bills, DARE, food banks, violence against women, insurance 
      coverage of chemical dependency treatment and missing and exploited children. 
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Minnesota's state-wide teachers' union endorsed 
      Ramstad. A piece of campaign literature, paid for by the National Education 
      Association, hailed Ramstad's work to provide more resources to schools, 
      support federal funding to renovate and repair school buildings, reduce 
      class size, provide staff training and early and higher education initiatives 
      and his opposition to vouchers. This package of issues could fit just about 
      anywhere in the nation. Their applicability elsewhere and the national press 
      Ramstad receives for backing them probably aren't too important to his constituents. 
      So what's important? That voters believe Ramstad has made our issues his 
      issues. That he deserves our support because &quot;...He works for Us, Children 
      and Public Education&quot;.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Other notes:</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Insurance coverage for chemical dependency treatment 
      is a priority of Ramstad's. He speaks openly about being a recovering alcoholic. 
      Minnesota has a national reputation for its treatment programs and facilities. 
      Ramstad's actions and words on this topic certainly make a connection to 
      anyone who has ever had to deal with health insurance coverage for alcohol 
      or drug treatment. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">A third to about one-half of my students do not 
      have Internet access at home. Some have parents who will take them to a 
      nearby public library to sign-up for and take their turn at the library's 
      computer; some have parents who are unable or unwilling to do so. Computer 
      lab time at school is shared by about 2700-2800 students. Students would 
      be more successful if the teacher preselects and limits students to a small 
      number (or maybe parts of) web sites. Doing so will also increase the chances 
      the teacher will leave the computer lab, at the end of the day, with some 
      sanity still intact. </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent"> I found the Power Index confusing to use. If 
      you chair a committee<br>
      (question #4) the member earns four points. What would merit a score of 
      five? If the member has no campaign funds on hand, she or he rates a -5. 
      What amounts of money correspond with the remaining negative numbers......and 
      all the positive numbers for this category? Perhaps I just don't understand 
      how the Index should be implemented. Maybe fewer numbers would help students 
      and teachers work with the Index. Expanded and more detailed scoring directions 
      would be much appreciated as well.<br>

    <p class="PrintableContent">First, let me say that my representative scored 
      very low on the &quot;Power Index.&quot; Jim DeMint is a Republican completing 
      his second term in the House. He does chair a subcommittee of the Transportation 
      and Infrastructure Committee. He was re-elected in 2000 with 77.6% of the 
      vote, not a surprise in this heavily Republican district. He has little 
      money on hand at this point (approximately $10,000), despite the 2002 election's 
      being only a few weeks away. However, his true opponent this election was 
      in the Republican primary in June. That was where he expended his funds.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">DeMint receives little exposure in the national 
      press. For the most part he enters their radar only when trade issues surface. 
      Our district is one where textiles used to be king. For quite a few years 
      now, textile mills have been closing as that industry has moved to other 
      countries. The district has done a good job attracting new industry, much 
      of it international. Thus we have the North American headquarters of Michelin, 
      a BMW plant that continues to expand, Hitachi, and others. DeMint broke 
      with some of the major Republicans in the district (Roger Milliken comes 
      to mind) over MFN status for China and trade promotion authority for the 
      president. He did negotiate with the administration for some protection 
      of the textile industry (its value remains to be seen), but voted a free 
      trade position on the key votes. As a result, he received some national 
      press. He also faced opposition in the Republican primary from a protectionist 
      opponent supported by Milliken et al. I decided to score him a 1 on &quot;exposure 
      in national press&quot; because of this.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Rating in the National Journal was included as 
      the final variable on the Power Index. My community college does not subscribe 
      to it, but I did find it at a local four-year college. However, the only 
      ratings I saw in the past couple of years related to &quot;most&quot; and 
      &quot;least&quot; liberal and conservative so I was not able to score this 
      one. DeMint received 3 for being in the majority party, 3 for chairing a 
      subcommittee, 3 for his margin of victory in 2000, and 1 for national press 
      exposure. In sum, DeMint scored a whopping 10 on the Power Index by my calculations!</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Thoughts on this --- first, DeMint ran for Congress 
      as an ardent term-limit supporter. He followed on the heels of the former 
      congressman, Bob Inglis, who had also been a disciple of term limits. Inglis 
      promised to run for only three terms and honored that promise (though he 
      did run unsuccessfully for the US Senate the very next election after his 
      third term in the House and rumor has it that he plans to run for his old 
      House seat in 2004, after DeMint completes his third term! Can you tell 
      that I am not a term limit supporter?). While I understand the philosophy 
      that drives term limits, its implementation has guaranteed no power for 
      the representative from the 4th district in South Carolina. </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">I would love to discuss term limits more with 
      colleagues, but will move on since that is not the topic of this lesson! 
      I leave it to you to ponder a state that currently has two senators who 
      collectively have served 84 years in the US Senate, but that also elects 
      representatives pledged to only 6 years in the House!</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Having read Barbara Sinclair's most interesting 
      article, I would like to raise another issue concerning the concept of &quot;representation.&quot; 
      Sinclair defines representation as an effort to reflect the views of the 
      district. She tempers this (potential for equating it with that &quot;delegate&quot; 
      approach to representation) by noting the need for representatives to build 
      trust with their constituents, which provides them with more leeway in their 
      policy-making (somewhat of the &quot;trustee&quot; model). I quite agree 
      with her that most members do not follow through on the need to educate 
      their constituents on the complexity of the policy-making process. As she 
      says, they take just the opposite position &quot;by running against Congress.&quot; 
    </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">I would like to ask where provision of constituent 
      service might fit in to the concept of representation. I would argue that 
      some members of Congress define representation to include helping their 
      constituents navigate government bureaucracies. Though this is not an issue 
      of policy-making, it can certainly contribute to a representative's or senator's 
      ability to get reelected, a function of their power. Perhaps I am more sensitive 
      to this than others because of my state's legendary Senator, Strom Thurmond! 
      Thurmond built constituent service into an art form and provided a model 
      others have followed. </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">As I pondered the relative lack of power of my 
      current congressman, I wondered what he hoped to accomplish in just 6 years 
      and what the folks who voted for him expected. Certainly, all members cannot 
      be leaders, but my impression is that he does little more than provide a 
      steady vote for the Republican majority in the House. Perhaps this is enough. 
      However, I would hope that he ran for Congress with at least a few burning 
      issues he wished to pursue. There is little present on his website concerning 
      issues and legislation he has initiated. The issues section is &quot;under 
      construction.&quot; He does list ten bills in the 107th Congress that he 
      sponsored. But of course that doesn't really indicate the extent of his 
      influence in their creation. Interestingly, there is a page devoted to &quot;services,&quot; 
      which reflects the constituent service issue.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">All of this leads me to two questions concerning 
      the Power Index. Is there some way that the power index could reflect a 
      member's influence on legislation other than by leadership positions? I 
      suppose that exposure in the national press would get at this. Perhaps the 
      ratings I could not find in the National Journal did as well. Also, is there 
      a way to factor constituent service into the index? If the notion of power 
      in the index only reflects power within the chamber, then perhaps constituent 
      service is irrelevant. However, as an element of representation of constituents, 
      I would argue it could be a major power factor. <br>
    </p>

    <p class="PrintableContent"><b>Basic</b></p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">For this assignment, I used the Power Index to 
      calculate the effectiveness of Louisiana's members of Congress. I feel that 
      they do a sufficient job, but it would be interesting to compare their role 
      in Congress to that of people from bigger, wealthier, and more influential 
      states. (i.e. New York)</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">According to my calculations, Richard Baker, my 
      district's representative, scored a 15. He does not have much exposure in 
      the national media, and, quite frankly, when I asked my colleagues who our 
      representative was, many of them did not even know. Ironically, they were 
      more familiar with representatives from other parts of the state than ours. 
      He does have minimal involvement in Congress, but considering he is in his 
      8th term, it seems he would have more influence!! However, Baker is in the 
      majority party of the Congress right now, and he did sweep the other candidates 
      in the last election.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">Mary Landrieu is our state's newest Senator. According 
      to my calculations, Landrieu's power index was tallied at 22. Although she 
      does not have seniority, it seems as if she has much influence in the Senate. 
      She is chair of Appropriations Committee, which is one of the most important 
      committees in Congress. She also chairs two subcommittees. Landrieu has 
      received negative exposure in the media because many people feel she has 
      forgotten about the needs of her home state. It should be interesting to 
      watch the results of the upcoming election.</p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">According to my calculations, John Breaux scored 
      a 19. He has seniority in the Senate and he (as well as Landrieu and Baker) 
      are members of the majority party. Breaux is actively involved as a Senator 
      for our state. He chairs the Committee of Agriculture, which is a bonus 
      for our state, and he chairs two subcommittees. Breaux is in his third term, 
      and I believe that his influence in the Senate will only continue to grow. 
    </p>
    <p class="PrintableContent"><b>Enhanced</b></p>
    <p class="PrintableContent">At first glance, I found the Power Index to be 
      confusing. I had difficulty tallying the information because I felt the 
      chart was unclear. As a teacher, I can just imagine the confusion this would 
      cause with a classroom full of teenagers. Once I began my research, however, 
      the chart began to make sense. On some of the questions I was unclear as 
      how to answer them. If this were to be assigned to a class, I would have 
      to be very specific as to where to find the information. I am unsure whether 
      or not my tallies are even accurate based on the material I used. For instance, 
      I did not know where to find information about how much funds each rep or 
      senator has remaining. I was able to find the numbers of funds for the last 
      election, but I was unsure where to find the present information. My power 
      index numbers are a very rough estimate.</p>
