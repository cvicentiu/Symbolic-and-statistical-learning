<h2>Between Iraq and a Hard Place, Again</h2>

The Bush Administration, backed obediently by Todd Platts and other members
of a go-along Congress, wants to invade Iraq. It is a stark and shocking
reality. We have come to a point in American history when a war of aggression
is openly proposed and defended by legislative appeasers of a regime without
shame or conscience. The rationalizations offered for an invasion defy
intellectual honesty. The arguments offered for aggression are naked assaults
on public fear, not appeals to reason.<p>

In the office where I work, a fellow employee has posted a clever quote from
General Norman Schwartzkof. Next to a photo of the helmeted firefighters
raising the American flag at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center,
the General is quoted as saying: "I believe that forgiving them is God's
function. Our job is simply to arrange the meeting."<p>

It's glib, vacuous and amoral, but able to amuse us because in one quick quip
it relieves us of moral responsibility, and more effectively than any of the
administration's arguments it brushes aside the petty details of who is
responsible for a monstrous disregard for human life. Instead, it invites us
to blamelessly participate in carnage that God will make right in the end.
What struck me was that the quote could just as easily have come from any one
of the terrorists. Believing in murder as a tool of justice and a God who is
served by it, both the General and the terrorists are able to rationalize
their inhumanity.<P>

The wonder is that in so moral a nation the administration's plans for a
preemptive war on Iraq, along with Representative Platts' uncritical support
for this kind of naked aggression have not yet been howled off the stage of
public debate.<P>

Apart from General Schwartzkof's dismissal of "forgiveness" for the murder of
thousands of civilians on American soil, the administration and the
congressman have just as glibly dismissed the idea of Justice.
The invasion of Afghanistan was rationalized with the argument that those
responsible for attacking American civilians were hiding in the Afghan
countryside. Never mind that the ringleaders were not found or that American
soldiers killed thousands of innocent civilians attempting to rout them. Not
even a convincing placebo for relief from skepticism about an invasion of
Iraq has been offered by the Bush administration. Military aggression against
a hypothetical threat is the best they can muster.<p>

It is an argument that Mr. Platts has no trouble swallowing. Obviously, he
has an under-active gag reflex.<P>

But the joke will be on us and the Iraqi people and the whole world if the
Bush plan for military dominance is not reined-in by the American people.
Finally, it is up to us to insist on democracy here at home before we pretend
to impose it abroad. It is time for the American people to refuse to be
represented to the world by leaders who intend to dishonor our constitution
and our national reputation with ad hoc jurisprudence and preemptive warfare.
Although the administration's arguments for invasion amount to nothing,
George Bush is clearly motivated by some strong desire to strike Iraq, depose
Saddam Hussein, and not take "no" for an answer. The American people deserve
to know the facts that motivate this obsession. Is it America's dependence on
oil, or rather the administration's grafting of oil industrialists onto the
policy making function of the federal executive that propels us into the
fray? Is it a personal grudge match, a generational bridge between Bush
presidencies?<P>

We know that it is not "weapons of mass destruction" or the flaunting of UN
resolutions that prompt aggression. If it were, then the list of targets
would be a long one, and our own country would be on it! Pakistan and India
have been threatening a nuclear holocaust over Kashmir. But U.S. troops have
not invaded the subcontinent and Mr. Bush remains curiously amenable to both
sides in the conflict. So what is the motivation for war on Iraq?
We know it is not justice that motivates the call to war. Terror suspects
have seen justice revoked, legal representation denied, appeals refused,
public knowledge of their detention forbidden here in our constitutional
democracy. The Bush administration mocks the International Criminal Court.
Congress, with the help of Todd Platts, passed legislation making it American
policy to launch military strikes against any nation holding accused war
criminals if they are American nationals. The world has been put on notice.
The American president will decide what justice is, and there will be no
American war criminals except those brought to trial by the administration's
personally overseen tribunals.<P>

It is easier to resist becoming a world tyrant when the military might is
lacking or when a powerful adversary is threatening retaliation for
aggression. It is a measure of character and commitment to justice for a
nation that has overcome these obstacles to avoid the forbidden fruit of
hubris and the lethargy of conscience that permits unreasoned and unjustified
wars of aggression.<P>

The people of the 19th district have been abandoned by their representative
and betrayed by an administration dazzled by its moment of power as it
attempts to steer the course of history without a moral compass. The only
power on earth able to turn us from disaster resides in the will of the
American people to command their government back to the path of peace and the
course of justice. There is no time to waste.<P>
