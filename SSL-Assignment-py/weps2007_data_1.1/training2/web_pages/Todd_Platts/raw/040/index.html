        <p class="regular">Congressional Candidate for the 19th district, Ben
        Price, calls for Todd Platts to mend his error in judgment and use his
        last opportunity to oppose Fast Track trade negotiation authority. Price
        referred to Fast Track as &quot;a job-killing, wage deflating,
        environmentally devastating and family farm bankrupting bonanza for
        international corporations.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The full text of Ben Price's statement follows:<br>
        <br>
        It remains a mystery to me that Representative Todd Platts continues to
        favor passage of Fast Track trade negotiating authority, which has now
        passed the House and Senate in different forms. Assuming a negotiated
        compromise emerges from the House-Senate conference committee, Todd
        Platts will have an opportunity to correct his error in judgment and
        vote against the bill.<br>
        <br>
        We need leaders in Congress who will stand up for our working families,
        the environment, family farmers, and not buckle under the pressure from
        corporate special interests. That's one reason why I'm running on the
        Green Party ticket to challenge Todd Platts for the 19th district
        congressional seat.<br>
        <br>
        Trade agreements like NAFTA and the World Trade Organization have only
        benefited large corporations that are well represented in the
        negotiation process. These agreements have checker flagged a race to the
        bottom when it comes to wages, public health, protecting the
        environment, food safety, and democratic representation in treaty
        negotiations.<br>
        <br>
        Fast Track is a legislative attempt to sidestep the American
        Constitution's commerce clause that makes negotiating international
        trade treaties a congressional responsibility. Fast Track would take the
        people's representatives out of the loop and let corporate CEOs meet in
        secret with the president to hash out the terms of international trade.
        We've already seen what secret negotiations between corporate honchos
        and the administration did for the petroleum industry and to the
        citizens in California and elsewhere. Do we really want the Enron model
        of profit over-all to dictate the parameters of trade throughout the
        Western hemisphere?<br>
        <br>
        Ignoring for the moment its undemocratic premise, attempts to amend the
        worst aspects of the Fast Track juggernaut failed in the Senate in large
        measure due to an abundance of congressional loyalty to the corporate
        agenda, which was nurtured by a flood of soft money contributions to
        both of the old parties. But even in their failure, the number and
        nature of the amendments offered made it clear that many Senators,
        including some who finally voted for the bill, knew and understood the
        devastating impact Fast Track will have on American workers, farmers,
        the environment, and even on our democracy.<br>
        <br>
        Fast Track and the treaties that would be ram-rodded through Congress if
        it is passed would be a job-killing, wage deflating, environmentally
        devastating and family farm bankrupting bonanza for international
        corporations.<br>
        <br>
        The Bush administration wants to expand the failed NAFTA model to the
        entire Western hemisphere. Todd Platts claims NAFTA was a
        &quot;job-maker,&quot; but it's really been a wage-buster. Using the new
        math of corporate &quot;go-figure&quot; accounting, forcing Americans to
        find a second job to make ends meet is what Fast Trackers like Mr.
        Platts mean by &quot;job creation.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Todd Platts' constituents are opposed to this kind of trade policy. It
        hurts our families and the environment. He should reverse his position
        and say NO to granting the president Fast Track. If he doesn't do the
        right thing, I will make it a top priority to undo the damage done once
        I am in office.<br>
