              - Bush Administration officials, federal agency managers, Congressional 
              staff, and good-government advocacy groups convened today for the 
              2004 Government Performance Summit to assess the progress in improving 
              management and accountability in the federal government under the 
              President's Management Agenda (PMA). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Now 
              in its third year of implementation, the President's Management 
              Agenda has become one of the most successful management reform initiatives 
              undertaken by the federal government in modern history. Nevertheless, 
              much is left to be done to achieve the ambitious goals of the PMA 
              to transform the operations of every federal agency to make them 
              citizen-centered, results-oriented and market-based. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">With 
              2004 an election year, many Summit participants raised key questions 
              regarding federal management reform: What can be done to institutionalize 
              the progress made under the PMA? Will Congress finally engage in 
              performance budgeting and use performance information to drive budget 
              decisions? Regardless of the outcome of the election, what's next 
              in federal management reform? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Presentations 
              at the Summit helped provide answers to these key reform questions. 
              Among the highlights:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Recognition 
              of Agency Successes </b><br>
              OMB Deputy Director for Management Clay Johnson and the initiative 
              &quot;owners&quot; for each of the five areas of the President's 
              Management Agenda each delivered updates on how agencies have progressed 
              in implementing the PMA and how they fared on the latest Management 
              Scorecard. In addition, agency officials presented some of their 
              best practices and most innovative management innovations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
              Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Energy received 
              specific praise for their exemplary success in implementing the 
              PMA. In announcing that the two agencies were being recognized by 
              the Performance Institute with &quot;Excellence in Management&quot; 
              awards, Carl DeMaio called their results thus far &quot;exemplary.&quot; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">&quot;OPM 
              and Energy have shown remarkable progress in implementing the performance-based 
              management reforms laid out in the President's Management Agenda,&quot; 
              DeMaio said. &quot;The hard work of the men and women at both organizations 
              deserves to be recognized and this summit, amongst an audience of 
              federal managers, was an ideal place to do it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Commitment 
              to Not Politicize Management</b><br>
              OMB Deputy Director Clay Johnson, delivering a keynote address, 
              cautioned attendees to the Government Performance Summit to keep 
              the year's electoral politics out of the management reforms they 
              are implementing. Johnson even floated the idea of renaming the 
              &quot;President's Management Agenda&quot; the &quot;Agency Management 
              Agenda&quot; to demonstrate the need for agencies to internalize 
              and personalize the management reforms in all five areas.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Johnson 
              expressed his delight with the government-wide progress made thus 
              far and reinforced the need for continued diligence - no matter 
              the results of the November election. &quot;The federal government 
              is in the process of becoming results-oriented,&quot; Johnson said. 
              &quot;It's not going to take one or two years and it's not going 
              to take 10 years. This is gonna happen.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Support 
              for Performance Budgeting Legislation</b><br>
              The legislation introduced last week by Rep. Todd Platts to codify 
              a performance review process modeled on the Program Assessment Rating 
              Tool drew praise from presenters and attendees. The Performance 
              Institute also formally announced its support for the bill, with 
              DeMaio saying, &quot;the PART is the first and one of the most important 
              steps in the long-term implementation of performance-based budgeting. 
              By making program assessment a Congressional mandate, an already 
              productive method of budget management will be sustained.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Additionally, 
              the Performance Institute announced its intention to circulate model 
              legislative language for performance budgeting with its &quot;Taxpayer 
              Bill of Rights&quot; - legislation that would combine a government 
              spending limit with performance assessments. The Institute is already 
              working with legislators in several states on passage of similar 
              legislation and will work with Congressional sponsors of a federal 
              spending limit to include performance in their proposed bill.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Support 
              for a Congressional Office of Program Performance</b><br>
              Recognizing the need to build congressional capacity for improved 
              oversight and review of federal program performance, the Performance 
              Institute announced its intention to propose a Congressional Office 
              of Program Performance (using joint resources of the Congressional 
              Budget Office and the General Accounting Office.) The COPP would 
              assume the responsibility for translating the reams of performance 
              and budgeting data produced by federal departments, agencies and 
              the White House into relevant, usable information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In 
              structuring its proposal for the COPP, the Institute is using the 
              Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability 
              in the State of Florida as an example. Dubbed as the &quot;monitoring 
              arm&quot; of the Florida State Legislature, OPPAGA's evaluation-based 
              recommendations have a direct impact on the budget decisions made 
              by the Legislature. Florida is but one of more than 40 states recognized 
              by the National Council of State Legislators as utilizing program 
              evaluation offices for program and agency oversight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Given 
              the exorbitant amount of data that flood Capitol Hill every year, 
              it is no wonder that members of Congress are reluctant to wade even 
              knee-deep into it. Efforts must be undertaken to assist Congress 
              in interpreting and subsequently using the extremely important data.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Combining 
              the investigative thoroughness of the GAO with the fiduciary expertise 
              of the CBO would create a systematic, methodical and streamlined 
              Congressional approach to Executive oversight - a critical aspect 
              of Congress' Constitutional responsibility largely neglected in 
              the last few years. The COPP should be charged by Congress with 
              conducting its own program assessments independent of the Office 
              of Management and Budget, whose Program Assessment Rating Tool has 
              paved the way for this style of evaluation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Proposed 
              Competitive Sourcing Language</b><br>
              Competitive sourcing-by far the most controversial of the management 
              reforms in the PMA-has attracted the attention state legislators 
              in Florida, California, Virginia and New York. PI is crafting model 
              legislation for those states that would formalize the competitive 
              sourcing process in a manner that emphasizes the intense evaluation 
              of both cost and performance, and requires a transparent reporting 
              process. The language would also demand from contractors a strict 
              accountability for results. Once this legislation is finished, the 
              Institute intends to promote similar legislation at the federal

              Congressional Committees and Stakeholders in Performance Dialogues<br>
              Although the PMA has stimulated an unprecedented level of discussion 
              about performance-based management reform within the Executive Branch, 
              the progress being made has been inhibited by the current lack of 
              engagement by Congress on the management reforms laid out in the 
              PMA. As a result, The Performance Institute will host a series of 
              Executive/Legislative dialogues throughout the year designed to 
              bring the performance management discussion to Congress. The first 
              two forums will be held next week, on March 10, and will be focused 
              on how performance-based budgeting and the Program Assessment Rating 
              Tool has been used and can be used in federal education programs, 
              and federal wildland fire programs. The Institute will host additional 
              forums throughout the year focused on other federal programs and 
              agencies. </font></p>

              Training for Congressional Staff</b><br>
              The very nature of checks-and-balances democracy necessitates a 
              commitment by Congress to exercise vigilant oversight of the Executive 
              Branch. The President's FY05 budget proposed a record $3.5 trillion 
              in discretionary spending, a proposal that translates to a tremendous 
              oversight responsibility.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Oversight 
              training for Congressional staff disappeared several years ago, 
              but today the Performance Institute announced its intention to host 
              free day-long training sessions on Capitol Hill beginning in May.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
              training will cover both day-to-day oversight and oversight during 
              the appropriations process, with a focus on how performance measurement 
              and management can be used to monitor federal programs. </font></p>
