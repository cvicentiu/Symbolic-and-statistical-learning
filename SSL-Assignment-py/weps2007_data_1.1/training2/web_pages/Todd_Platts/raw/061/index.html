    PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- A bipartisan group of
Pennsylvania's federal representatives are calling for increased funding of
the SBDC program in the next federal budget (fiscal year 2005).  The increased
funds would be used to expand the program to help more entrepreneurs start and
grow successful businesses.  Leading the push for boosting the SBDC program
are Senator Arlen Specter (R) and Representatives Joseph Hoeffel (D-13), Tim
Holden (D-17), Joseph Pitts (R-16), Todd Platts (R-19), and Curt Weldon (R-7).
    "The SBDC provides small businesses with the tools necessary to compete in
the global economy at minimal cost to the American taxpayer," remarks
Representative Todd Platts.  Furthermore, explains Representative Joseph
Pitts, "The small business sector is creating most of the new jobs in America,
and we should be doing more to help those Americans who want to invest in our
economic future."
    "Despite the obvious benefits that SBDCs accomplish in countless
communities, funding for the program has remained at the same level since
2001," said Representative Joseph Hoeffel.  Representative Tim Holden points
out that this means that, "Funding for our nation's SBDC network has actually
decreased in real terms since 2001."
    Representative Curt Weldon sums up the group's shared support of the SBDC
program by noting, "An investment in generating more small businesses will
create jobs, spur innovation and increase tax revenue."
    "On behalf of the 35,000 entrepreneurs assisted each year by the 16 Small
Business Development Centers in Pennsylvania, we are very grateful for this
strong showing of support from the state's elected officials in Washington,"
states Pennsylvania SBDC State Director Gregory L. Higgins, Jr.  "If we should
receive this funding, the SBDCs will increase capabilities to help start new
businesses and stimulate job creation all across the Commonwealth."
    As the largest statewide provider of entrepreneurial services, the SBDCs
play a unique and vital role in the Commonwealth's economic development
initiatives as the only organization that:

    -- utilizes the expertise and resources of 16 of the best colleges and
       universities in the Commonwealth;
    -- assists entrepreneurs in all stages of business, from prospective
       entrepreneurs to mature small businesses looking for growth
       opportunities;
    -- works with firms in all industry sectors, including the fast-growing
       service and retail sectors that comprise the bulk of the state's
       firms, as well as manufacturing, construction and wholesale;
    -- is nationally accredited as mandated by Congress; and
    -- can draw upon the resources of a national network of more than 950
       Centers.

    Since 1990, the SBDCs have helped Pennsylvania entrepreneurs:

    -- start more than 13,000 new businesses;
    -- obtain $1.3 billion in start-up and expansion funding;
    -- expand sales by $5.1 billion, including $1.4 billion of government
       contracts and $1 billion in export sales;
    -- create over 70,000 new jobs at an average cost of $926 per job; and
    -- generate nearly $500 million in new tax revenues.

    The Pennsylvania Small Business Development Centers are funded by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the
private sector and the host colleges and universities.  This support enables
consulting services to be provided at no charge.  SBDCs are located at
Bucknell University, Clarion University, Duquesne University, Gannon
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Kutztown University, Lehigh
University, Lock Haven University, Penn State University, Saint Francis
University, Saint Vincent College, Temple University, University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, University of Pittsburgh, University of
Scranton, and Wilkes University.

Centers, please contact Ryan Gonzales at (215) 898-1219 or
