Farewell for a fallen hero<br>Navy SEAL Neil C. Roberts was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in North York.<br>By SHAWN LEDINGTON<br>Quietly, beneath a cloudy sky, a fallen Navy hero in the war on terrorism was buried Tuesday at Prospect Hill Cemetery in North York. <br>A 21-gun salute punctuated the private ceremony for Navy SEAL Petty Officer 1st Class Neil C. Roberts, who was shot and killed March 4 by al-Qaida forces after he fell from a helicopter in the Kharwar Mountains of Afghanistan. <br>After a week of media coverage detailing the story of his killing, Roberts, 32, was buried with about 150 people in attendance. There was no viewing or funeral procession. <br>Roberts' widow, Patricia, chose to bury her husband in York "because York is Patty's home," said family friend Christina Kalassay, whose husband is also in the military. <br>Patty was born and raised in York County. She graduated from Dallastown Area High School in 1986. <br>Neil Roberts' hometown is Woodland, Calif., where he grew up one of 12 children and as a twin. <br>The couple, who married in 1998, had been living with their 18-month-old son, Nathan, in Virginia Beach, Va., where Roberts was stationed to work in Naval Special Warfare Group Two. <br>Roberts left California for the Navy when he was 18, Kalassay said. <br>"The Navy sends you wherever it wants to send you," she said. "Neil spent his childhood in California. But he spent his adulthood in the Navy." <br>What mattered to him is what Patty wanted, she said. <br>"He'd go wherever she wants him to go," Kalassay said. <br>Kalassay said she didn't know if Patty, whose maiden name is Page, plans to return to live in York with her son, who resembles his red-headed father. <br>"This is the worst thing that has ever happened to her," Kalassay said. "Time will heal some of it. Time will help, but it won't fix. Time can't replace what is lost." <br>Kalassay said Patty has two families to rely on to help her through this difficult time. <br>"She has her military family and she has her York family," she said. <br>Neil Roberts, too, had two families. He was close with Patty's parents, Gilbert Page Jr. of Dallastown and Lois Weary of Springettsbury Township. Despite the miles, they did everything they could to get together, whenever they could. <br>In addition to Patty's family, Roberts' relatives from California also attended Tuesday's funeral, said Lt. Cmdr. Denise Shorey, a Navy spokeswoman. <br>SEAL commander, Rear Adm. Eric Olson, presented American flags to Patty and Roberts' mother, Janet. The flag that had been draped over the casket went to Patty. Navy Chaplain Lt. Buck Underwood delivered the eulogy. <br>U.S. Rep. Todd Platts also attended the ceremony. He declined to comment at the request of the family. <br>About 40 uniformed SEALs attended. In the middle of the ceremony, one by one, each walked past the casket, stopped and saluted. <br>Shorey said the individual salutes are not always done at military funerals. She said it is a symbol of the SEAL family. <br>On March 4, a pair of Chinook helicopters tried to land high in the Kharwar Mountains to drop off Roberts and the rest of his team, Navy officials said. They were to intercept enemy soldiers. But unexpectedly heavy fire forced the team back into the chopper. It took to the air quickly, and Roberts somehow tumbled out. He survived the fall, and was shot by al-Qaida troops. Six Americans died and 11 were wounded during that attack and the effort to retrieve his body. <br>Kalassay said relatives are deeply saddened by the loss of everyone in the attack that killed Roberts. She said Patty is especially grateful to the people of York for respecting her privacy and supporting her at this time. <br>Roberts enlisted in the Navy in 1987. He joined the East Coast Naval Special Warfare commands in 1992. He spent the Gulf War in Guam, far from the action, working as an aviation technician. It was then, a friend told the Associated Press, that he vowed to become a Navy SEAL. <br>In a family statement, relatives said that Roberts "loved his family deeply and he loved being a SEAL. He loved his country and would want everyone to know that this is how he would have wanted to go." <br>"He made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that everyone who calls himself or herself an American truly has all the privileges of living in the greatest country in the world." <br>Neil Robert's love for his family and friends was evident at all times. <br>"He could lift your spirits instantly with a quirky quote or a catchy phrase or when he flashed that great smile of his," according to the statement. <br>"If you were one of Neil's friends, you were a lucky person," Kalassay said. <br>Before he went on the March 4 mission, Roberts wrote his wife a letter from Afghanistan, telling her a number of things, including that if he died, he died doing what he loved. <br>"I loved being a SEAL," he wrote. "If I died doing something for the Teams, then I died doing what made me happy. Very few people have the luxury of that." <br>At a ceremony Monday in Norfolk, Va., Patty was presented decorations that the Navy awarded to Roberts for his heroism: a Purple Heart and a bronze star, with the combat distinguishing device, Shorey said. <br>"We in the Navy consider him to be a hero, by his sheer essence," she said, "and the fact that he gave his life for his country." <br>Farewell for a fallen hero<br>Navy SEAL Neil C.
