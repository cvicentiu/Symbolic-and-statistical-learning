Association Health Plans (AHPs) have existed for decades, both multi-state and intra-state. However, while the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) preempts state regulations for most corporate and union health plans, it does not preempt AHPs - a critical difference that has led to the relative extinction of AHPs. <BR><BR>

As state regulations and mandates have proliferated in the last decade, AHPs have become increasingly difficult to operate. <b> In 1990, there were more than 1,000 AHPs. Today, there are fewer than 200. </b> <BR><BR>

The primary obstacle to creating and running an AHP today is state regulation. <BR><BR>

The simplest way to allow AHPs to prosper again is to extend ERISA to AHPs, allowing association health plans to operate like a corporate or labor union health plan. <BR><BR>

Following is a brief history of the effort to pass AHP legislation, starting in 1995 and continuing <a href="#1">today</a>.<BR><BR>

<b>104th Congress</b> <BR><BR>

When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Il.-13, introduced stand-alone AHP legislation that was approved by the House in 1996 as a portion of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). However, the AHP legislation was dropped in conference due to opposition from the Clinton Administration. <BR><BR>

<b>105th Congress</b> <BR><BR>

In 1997, Rep. Fawell again introduced AHP legislation in the House. At the same time, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., introduced a similar AHP bill in the Senate, with Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., as a cosponsor. The House bill was added to the Balanced Budget Act and approved by the House. However, the AHP legislation was dropped during the House-Senate conference. <BR><BR>

In 1998, the AHP bill was included in the House Republican version of the Patients' Bill of Rights (PBOR) before it passed the House. Then, significant changes were made to the bill in an attempt to stifle opposition from the National Governors Association. However, the Senate never passed PBOR legislation that year. <BR><BR>

<b>106th Congress</b> <BR><BR>

After Fawell's retirement, Reps. Jim Talent, R-Mo.-2, and Cal Dooley, D-Calif.-20 introduced AHP legislation in 1999, and the House approved the bill as a component of the PBOR. The Senate passed its equivalent legislation without AHPs, and the conference committee deadlocked in 2000. <BR><BR>

<b>107th Congress</b> <BR><BR>

In 2001, Reps. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky.-6, and Dooley reintroduced the association health plan bill - <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.1774:" target=new>The Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2001</a> - in the House, and Sens. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Kit Bond, R-Mo., reintroduced the bill in the Senate. The House approved the Fletcher/Dooley AHP bill as an amendment to the Patients' Bill of Rights on August 2, 2002. The Senate did not pass AHP legislation in the 107th Congress. <BR><BR>

<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.660:" target=new>The Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003 (H.R. 660)</a>, sponsored by Reps. Fletcher, Dooley, Sam Johnson, R-Texas-3, and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y.-12, would authorize the formation and multi-state operation of federally-certified association health plans (AHPs). AHPs would be regulated under a single set of federally-prescribed rules, and permitted exemptions from costly state regulations that large corporate and union health plans already enjoy under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).<BR><BR>

The Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003 (S. 545) was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, on March 6, 2003. The original co-sponsors joining Snowe include Sens. Kit Bond, R-Mo., Jim Talent, R-Mo., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C.<BR><BR>
