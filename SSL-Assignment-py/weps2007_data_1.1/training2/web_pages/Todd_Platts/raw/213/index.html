												<p><b>IN THIS ISSUE:</b><br>	-From the Director’s Desk: <i>The Quit Smoking Incentive and Opportunity Act of 2003</i><br>	-Research Update<br>	-Cessation and Mass Media<br>	-Other News: <br>		--<i> NCI Introduces New Web Site to Promote Smoking Cessation</i><br>-- <i>Innovators Award Recognizes Fiore’s Contributions to Tobacco Cessation</i><br>--<i>Open Call for Proposals (Smoke-Free Families)</i> <br><br><b><big>FROM THE DIRECTOR’S DESK</b></big><br><br>While the U.S. House of Representatives is now enjoying its summer recess, upon their return in the fall Representatives have waiting for them an exciting opportunity to help ease the burden of tobacco use. On July 24 U.S. Representatives Steven LaTourette (R-OH), Todd Platts (R-PA), and Marty Meehan (D-MA) jointly introduced The Quit Smoking Incentive and Opportunity Act of 2003 which calls for a refundable tax credit for the cost of tobacco cessation medication and counseling (up to $400) for smokers seeking to quit.<br><br>It goes without saying that our nation must improve the support it provides to help smokers quit. This legislation offers an interesting incentive, potentially a way to increase smokers’ motivation to end their addictive habits and guide them toward evidence-based treatments, including FDA-approved medications and behavioral counseling. Combined, medication and counseling can dramatically increase the chances of successful quit attempts.<br><br>By easing the expense of obtaining evidence-based treatments through a refundable tax credit, the proposed bill inventively helps to reduce smokers’ out-of-pocket costs for tobacco dependence treatments. Reducing out-of-pocket costs, a proven way to increase tobacco cessation rates, has traditionally been considered the domain of health care systems, employers, and insurers through improved coverage or reduced co-pays. As proposed, the measure will allow all individuals up to a $300 refundable credit for FDA-approved tobacco cessation products and up to $100 annually for counseling. <br><br>Passage of the proposed legislation is one way the Federal government can set the example for reducing the barriers to tobacco cessation treatments. Representative LaTourette reminds us that currently “the cost of over-the-counter products like nicotine replacement gum and patches is not covered by Medicare, and is rarely covered by private insurance.” Further, he said, “Medicaid coverage of these products is sporadic and current tax law makes it difficult or impossible to write off the costs.”<br><br>While we recognize the many hurdles that lie before the enactment of this legislation, any opportunity to discuss the benefits of removing barriers to tobacco cessation is a welcome one. We appreciate Reps. LaTourette, Meehan, and Platts for bringing a fresh perspective to the dialogue on tobacco cessation and for their commitment to helping all smokers who want to quit get access to the science-based treatments that give them the best chance of success. <br><br>Read the press release from U.S. Representative LaTourette’s office on his home page: <a href="http://www.house.gov/latourette" target=_blank">http://www.house.gov/latourette</a><br><br><b><big>RESEARCH UPDATE</b></big><br><i>Research Update highlights what’s new in tobacco cessation research:</i>  <br><br>Murphy JM, <i>et al.</i>  Impact of economic policies on reducing tobacco use among Medicaid clients in New York. <i>Prev Med.</i> 2003 Jul;37(1):68-70.  <br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> New York State (NYS) recently implemented Medicaid coverage for prescription pharmacologic adjuncts for cessation and a 55-cent excise tax on a pack of cigarettes. This study examined awareness and use of stop smoking medications and changes in smoking/purchasing behavior among Medicaid clients. Participants (n = 173) were English-speaking Medicaid clients, ages 18-64 years who currently smoked cigarettes and volunteered to be interviewed while waiting to reregister with the NYC Medicaid Office during early 2001. Data were collected using a brief (10-min) interviewer-administered questionnaire.<br><b>RESULTS:</b> Over 80% of Medicaid clients reported some desire to stop smoking and 40% intended to stop smoking in the next 6 months. Awareness of Medicaid coverage for tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy was 7% for nicotine replacement therapy and 13% for bupropion. Use of these stop- smoking medications varied across products but in general was low (<10%). Half of the Medicaid clients reported changing their smoking behavior as a result of the cigarette tax increase. The authors concluded that the majority of Medicaid clients report a desire to stop smoking, but these economic influences alone are insufficient to substantially reduce smoking in this population. These findings emphasize the importance of allocating a portion of tobacco tax revenue to promote both expanded awareness of this prescription benefit among Medicaid clients and to support programs to further assist low-income smokers in their attempts to stop smoking.<br><br><i>Pollak KI, et al.</i>  Weight and smoking cessation among low-income African Americans. Am J <i>Prev Med.</i> 2003 Aug;25(2):136-9.  <br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Concerns about weight gain have been a commonly cited barrier to cessation among white, affluent, female populations, but less is known about this relationship among minority smokers and those with low incomes. Although smoking cessation is strongly encouraged for this population, it often leads to weight gain. Cultural differences in weight standards and the high prevalence of weight-related health conditions (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) may influence concerns about smoking cessation-related weight gain. A secondary analysis of low-income African-American smokers (n=367) from a randomized intervention trial was conducted to explore the association of weight concerns with comorbidities and smoking cessation. <br><b>RESULTS:</b> Less than one quarter of participants were considered concerned about weight, defined as having high general concern about weight and high expectation of post-cessation weight gain. Those for whom weight gain could be riskiest-obese participants-were least concerned about gaining weight. Further, weight concerns were not associated with successful smoking cessation, quit attempts, confidence in quitting, or desire or readiness to quit. Because post-cessation weight gain may be a serious health threat for this population, but weight gain was not a concern for these smokers, smoking-cessation interventions for low-income African-American smokers may need to incorporate weight-gain education and prevention.<br><br>Klerman LV, Spivey C. Smoking-related activities in prenatal care programs. <i>Am J Prev Med.</i> 2003 Aug;25(2):129-35.  <br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> An exploratory study was conducted to determine what public and quasi-public facilities serving pregnant women were doing to assist pregnant smokers in quitting, the reasons why more was not being done, and what could be done to increase smoking-cessation services. Questionnaires eliciting information about pregnancy-related smoking prevention activities were mailed to home visitation projects, federally funded Healthy Start programs, CityMatCH members, and maternal and child health units in state health departments with a sub sample of local health units. Responses were obtained from 354 programs.<br><b>RESULTS:</b> Only about a quarter of the respondents thought they were doing enough to help pregnant smokers stop or reduce smoking, and most thought that the inadequacy was due to insufficient funds. Only about a quarter offered smoking-cessation classes or clinics. Almost all programs had policies restricting smoking in their offices. The nationally sponsored activity that the respondents felt might be most helpful in increasing their efforts was the provision of materials. Among the 313 programs that included home visits, 86% required the home visitors to conduct a needs assessment, and 97% of those expected the woman's smoking status to be recorded. Smoking status prior to pregnancy or by other household members was required less often. Less than half of the programs provided training on smoking-cessation/reduction methods to home visitors. Only 28% said smoking-cessation/reduction had a very high priority in comparison to other home visit objectives. Programs for pregnant women, including those with a home visit component, do not pay sufficient attention to the problem of smoking among their clients. Programs should make greater use of the evidence-based interventions now available.<br><br>Cox LS,<i> et al.</i> Nicotine dependence treatment for patients with cancer. <i>Cancer.</i> 2003 Aug 1;98(3):632-44.  <br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Cancer patients who use tobacco demonstrate characteristics of strong nicotine dependence and are at increased risk for future tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Continued smoking may contribute to poorer cancer treatment outcome and additional illness. In contrast, stopping smoking may improve quality of life and facilitate cancer treatment. Unfortunately, limited attention has been given to addressing tobacco use and treating nicotine dependence in cancer patients. The authors reviewed the current literature on smoking cessation and nicotine dependence treatment in patients with cancer. <br><b>RESULTS:</b> Nicotine dependence treatment in patients with cancer facilitates smoking cessation. Evidence that cancer patients are motivated and able to stop smoking support tobacco use treatment intervention. Research is needed to evaluate effective intervention to aid tobacco abstinence and evaluate related health benefits for this patient population. <br><br>Tonnesen P, <i>et al.</i> A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-year study of bupropion SR for smoking cessation.<i> J Intern Med.</i> 2003 Aug;254(2):184-192.  <br><br><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The objective of this study was to determine whether bupropion SR, in combination with counselling, is effective for smoking cessation in a multi-country study. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 707 smokers. A total of 527 received bupropion SR 300 mg daily for 7 weeks and 180 received placebo. A total of 11 clinic visits and 10 telephone contacts were scheduled, during the course of 1 year. Seven-week and 12-month abstinence rates were the study outcomes.<br><b>RESULTS:</b> Both continuous and weekly point prevalence smoking abstinence rates were significantly higher in the bupropion SR group compared with placebo. The continuous abstinence rate from weeks 4 to 7 was 46% in the bupropion SR group compared with 23% in the placebo group [odds ratio (OR) = 2.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-4.28; P < 0.001). At month 12, the continuous abstinence rates were 21% for the bupropion SR group and 11% for the placebo group (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.29-3.86, P = 0.002). For most nicotine-withdrawal symptoms small changes were measured. Adverse events were higher for the bupropion SR group compared with placebo (insomnia 24% vs. 15%; dry mouth 13% vs. 5%). The authors conclude that Bupropion SR in combination with counselling increased the abstinence rate compared with placebo, and was well tolerated.<br><br>Tobacco Control Supplement: Insights from Australia's National Tobacco Campaign: 1 September 2003; Vol.12, Supplement No. 2. <br><br>To access the supplement on line: <a href="http://www.tobaccocontrol.com/content/vol12/suppl_2/index.shtml?etoc" target=_blank">http://www.tobaccocontrol.com/content/vol12/suppl_2/index.shtml?etoc</a><br><br>The papers in this supplement demonstrate that “national campaigns are effective in changing attitudes and readiness to quit, and that these are cost effective interventions compared with dollars allocated to other health programs.” Key cessation-related articles in this supplement include: <br>·	T Carroll, Rock B.

Dr. Fiore, one of five recipients in the United States, was chosen for his national leadership in promoting tobacco cessation. <br><br>The Innovators Award recognizes past achievement and provides the recipient with a stipend of $300,000 for up to three years of future work combating substance abuse nationally. Dr. Fiore, who is recognized for his work in treating tobacco dependence and for helping physicians across America to view tobacco dependence as a chronic disease, will use the award to promote the recommendations of the National Action Plan for Tobacco Cessation, which he recently helped develop as chair of the Subcommittee on Cessation of the Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health (ICSH).  <br><br>Innovators Combating Substance Abuse is a national program of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that recognizes and rewards those who have made substantial, innovative contributions of national significance in the field of substance abuse.  The Innovators program is run by a national program office at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.<br><br><b>Open Call for Proposals: Smoke-Free Families: Innovations to Stop Smoking During and Beyond Pregnancy – Phase III</b><br>The current Phase III of funding will provide up to $3 million over a two-year period to support up to five observational studies, up to seven pilot studies, and up to five new investigator dissertation awards.  Researchers are invited to propose studies that will increase knowledge about behaviors associated with cigarette smoking and will lead to interventions to reduce smoking rates among women before, during and after pregnancy.  Of special interest are studies that test innovative interventions to help parents of young children quit smoking or substantially reduce the amount they smoke and to avoid exposing young children to secondhand smoke. Smoke-Free Families is a national program supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.<br><b>Brief Proposal Deadline:</b> August 26, 2003 (2:00 PM CT)<br>To access the complete Call for Proposals: <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/cfp/smokefreefamilies" target=_blank">http://www.rwjf.org/cfp/smokefreefamilies</a> or call (205) 975-8951<br><br><br><br><i>If you would like to join our mailing list, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ctc@cancer.org">ctc@cancer.org</a> with ‘add’ in the subject field and your contact information.
