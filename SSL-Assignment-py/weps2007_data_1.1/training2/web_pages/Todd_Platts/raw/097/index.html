                    Secretary of the Department of Banking, effective June 5.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">Bedekovic replaced James Kauffman Jr.,
                    who resigned to become Vice President of Compliance for

                    <p class="normalke">&quot;Fran Bedekovic has an impressive
                    background in the banking industry, starting as a teller

                    sales manager, commercial lender and eventually a senior
                    vice president,&quot; Gov. Schweiker said. &quot;Fran knows
                    and understands the needs of Pennsylvania’s financial
                    institutions and their customers. Her experience in the
                    banking industry and her dedication to the Commonwealth will
                    serve her well in this new position.&quot;</p>

                    The department also licenses more than 12,000 non-depository

                    <p class="normalke">Vice President Dick Cheney was in
                    Harrisburg on Friday, June 7 to lend his support to U.S.
                    Rep. George Gekas’ re-election bid. During the fundraiser
                    luncheon, Cheney devoted much of his 20-minute speech to
                    President Bush’s efforts to improve security in the
                    aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">Among the 300 people attending the
                    fundraiser luncheon were Congressmen Phil English, Joe
                    Pitts, Todd Platts, Don Sherwood and, of course, Gekas.
                    League staff attending included: Jim McCormack, League
                    President/CEO; Jan Hartman, Vice President, Governmental
                    Affairs; and Christina Dunn, Governmental Affairs
                    Specialist. The staff had the opportunity to speak with
                    Congressman Gekas, as well as Representatives Joe Pitts and
                    Todd Platts.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">Gekas faces a challenge from Democratic
                    U.S. Rep. Tim Holden, who is seeking a fifth term, in the
                    November 5 general election. Holden is now part of the newly
                    redrawn 17th District in central Pennsylvania, which has
                    been served by Gekas. The luncheon raised $200,000,
                    including money contributed by supporters who did not attend
                    the event.</p>

                    foundations and the National Credit Union Foundation (NCUF)
                    spent time in Hershey, June 5-7, networking with one another
                    at the State Credit Union Foundation Network meeting. The
                    meeting, hosted by the Pennsylvania Credit Union League, was
                    opened by League President/CEO Jim McCormack.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">The network facilitates communication,
                    creates and fosters partnerships and defines the role of
                    development through the sharing of resources among its
                    member organizations. The meeting provides Foundations with
                    an opportunity to network with one another and exchange
                    marketing materials. It combined peer presentations and
                    facilitated discussions, with topics ranging from marketing
                    and fundraising ideas, to regulations and foundation
                    accounting.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">The NCUF, through the Ohio Foundation,
                    issued a legal manual that provides the legal framework for
                    the establishment and the operation of a Foundation. Its
                    contents can be used as a legal reference to all fundraising
                    and grants-making activities.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">Joe Wambach, Executive Director of the
                    Pennsylvania Credit Union Foundation, found the discussions
                    far more sophisticated than in the past. &quot;The session
                    provided the most definitive accounting and regulatory
                    information I’ve ever seen. This will assure that State
                    Foundations are run efficiently and properly. I can’t wait
                    to see what the next meeting will be like,&quot; Wambach
                    said.</p>
                    <p class="normalke">The Pennsylvania Credit Union Foundation
                    continues to lead the way in Major Gifts Fundraising
                    Activities. Its annual Arts Expo and Raffle continues to be
                    a model for marketing the Foundation, as well as a valuable
                    fund raising tool. It is also apparent that the Foundation
                    continues to provide a greater number of grants to its
                    constituency than do other Foundations at this stage.</p>

                    <i>
                    <h4>Credit Unions Should Target-Market</h4>
                    </i></b>
                    <p>A recent study issued by the Filene Research Institute, <i>Life
                    Cycle Marketing for Credit Unions: Mid Age Households</i>,
                    suggests that credit unions don’t do enough to segment
                    their marketing strategies.</p>
                    <p>When targeting age groups, the study recommends that you
                    further segment by marital status and presence of children,
                    to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your
                    marketing campaign. Using age alone, the researchers found,
                    has significant shortcomings because age segmentation may
                    mask large differences within age groups.</p>
                    <p>The study examines the various aspects that define
                    financial service needs among households in which the head
                    is between the ages of 35 and 64 and is the second of four
                    studies on life cycling marketing for credit unions
                    published by the Filene Research Institute.</p>
