<p><strong>Republicans Appoint 6 New Members to House
Committee</strong></p>

<p>The House Education and the Workforce Committee had seven
Republican slots open at the beginning of the 107th Congress;
slots that were vacated by members who either retired, ran for
other office, or who left to serve in other committees. Six of
those positions have been filled by: Reps. Todd Platts of
Pennsylvania; Patrick Tiberi of Ohio; Ric Keller of Florida; Tom
Osborne of Nebraska, John Culberson of Texas (all freshmen
members), and Judy Biggert of Illinois (a second-term member).
One slot is still open, but it is not known if or when it will be
filled.</p>

<p>The Democrats have two positions to fill, but have not
announced those appointments as of yet.</p>

<p>If you live in one of the new Committee members' states, it's
a good idea to get to know them as soon as possible, before the
real work of this Congress begins. Contact them either in person,
by phone, or by e-mail through CEC's Legislative Action Center at
<a

Introduce yourself to your member of Congress, and offer yourself

<p><strong>Clinton, Edwards Added to Senate HELP
Committee</strong></p>

<p>After the November elections, the Senate was split evenly
between Democrats and Republicans, with the Vice-President
issuing a deciding vote should a tie occur. The Senate committee
and subcommittee structures have been adjusted to reflect this
new equality, and two new Democratic positions opened up on the
Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
Freshmen Senators Hillary Clinton (D-NY), and John Edwards (D-NC)
have been appointed to the Committee.</p>

<p><strong>President Clinton Releases His "FY 2002 Economic
Outlook"</strong></p>

<p>Although President-elect Bush is required by law to issue a
proposed federal budget by the first Monday in February, outgoing
President Clinton has issued a document that provides a current
services budget projection - essentially what is the cost of
maintaining current programs and policies after factoring in an
inflation adjustment for discretionary programs and mandatory
programs increases. According to information from the Committee
for Education Funding (CEF), of which CEC is a member, for FY
2002, the current services surplus is projected to be $277
billion, with an on-budget surplus (not counting Social Security
and Medicare) of $69 billion. The 10-year total (FY 2002-2011)
unified budget surplus is projected to be $4.996 trillion, with
an on-budget non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus of $1.914
trillion.</p>

<p>According to CEF, one interesting situation is that starting
in 2009, the amount of the surplus that is available to repay
debt held by the public will exceed the amount of debt available
to be paid, which will cause "excess balances" to build up -
essentially there will be a "surplus surplus." In reality this is
unlikely to occur, because most of the surplus will be used up
for tax cuts and spending increases.</p>

<p>The document also provides information on budget baseline
alternatives. If the baseline is adjusted to assume that expiring
tax provisions will continue, and adjusted for other anomalies,
then the 10-year on-budget surplus would decline from $1.914
trillion to $1.643 trillion. If discretionary programs grow at
the same rate as the economy, as opposed to just an inflation
adjustment, the surplus would be reduced by another $979 billion.
If population increases were factored into discretionary
programs, that would add another $362 billion in spending over
ten years.</p>

<p>In reviewing budget actions during President Clinton's term,
the document notes that for Function 500 (under which education
programs fall), total discretionary spending has increased from
$38.192 billion in FY 93 to $61.121 billion in FY 2001 (+60%),
while tax expenditures for education and related programs rose
from $21.855 billion to $59.450 billion (+172%).</p>

<p>Following is the portion of the Clinton document that
discusses special education:</p>

<p>Special Education: Under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA), the Education Department works with States
to ensure that more than six million children with disabilities
receive a "free appropriate public education." During this
Administration, Federal support for special education programs
authorized under the IDEA increased by more than 150 percent,
from nearly $3.0 billion in 1993 to $7.4 billion in 2001, and the
Federal share of special education costs increased from eight
percent to 15 percent.</p>

<p>In 1997, the IDEA reauthorization focused attention not only
on guaranteeing access to public schools, but also on ensuring
that students with disabilities receive a high-quality education
based on the same challenging standards as their nondisabled
peers. As of July 1, 1998, all States were required to have
performance goals and strategies in place for students with
disabilities aged three to 21, and to report their progress
toward meeting those goals on a biennial basis. By July 1, 2000,
all States were required to include special education children in
State and district-wide regular assessments or provide alternate
assessments to measure educational performance. Based on the
latest data available, during this Administration:</p>

<p>* The number and percentage of students with disabilities who
leave high school with a regular diploma has increased from
114,000, or 62 percent, of all students with disabilities in
1994, the earliest year comparable data are available, to
149,000, or 57 percent, in 1999.</p>

<p>* The percentage of students with disabilities who dropped out
of school decreased from 35 percent in 1994 to 29 percent in
1999.</p>

<p>The entire document, "FY 2002 Economic Outlook, Highlights
From FY 1994 to FY 2001, FY 2002 Baseline Projections," is
available at: <a

<p><strong>Early Head Start Shows Significant Results for Low
Income Children and Parents</strong></p>

<p>HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today released a preliminary
evaluation of Early Head Start showing that children in the new
child development program performed significantly better in
cognitive, language and social-emotional development compared to
children not participating in the program. Parents in Early Head
Start also showed more positive parenting behavior, reported less
physical punishment of their children and provided more help for
their children to learn at home.</p>

<p>Early Head Start provides high quality child and family
development services to pregnant women and infants and toddlers,
from birth to age</p>

<p>3, a time considered one of the most important in a child's
cognitive and social development. It was started in 1995 as a new
component of the Head Start program that serves children age 3 to
4.</p>

<p>"Early Head Start is about giving our youngest and most
disadvantaged children a chance to grow up healthy, to learn and
to prepare for school," said Secretary Shalala. "Everyone who
helped create the program, the providers who teach the children,
and the parents who are taking part can be very proud of what
we've accomplished in a very short time."</p>

<p>Major findings of the preliminary evaluation of 2-year-old
children in the program include higher scores in standardized
tests of infant and toddler development and reports of larger
vocabularies and the ability to speak in more complex sentences.
One-third of Early Head Start children were found to be at risk
of slower developmental learning compared to 40 percent of the
non-Early Head Start children. This indicates that Early Head
Start children may also be less at risk of needing special
learning intervention services in later years.</p>

<p>The results pertaining to parents present further evidence of
Early Head Start's ability to promote learning in the home, to
better prepare children for school, and to reduce family stress.
The preliminary study reports that Early Head Start parents were
more supportive of promoting learning, language and literacy at
home by reading more to their children and engaging in more
structured play activity than parents not in the program. Early
Head Start parents also set more regular bedtimes and read to
children before sleep. They spanked their children less and were
more likely to resolve problems by using distraction, explanation
or mild responses rather than physical punishment. Early Head
Start parents also reported lower levels of family conflict and
stress related to parenting. These findings indicate that the
program is equipping parents with strategies to cope with
conflict and to help break a cycle of parental stress and
potential harm to children.</p>

<p>"This study is enormously important for the future of Early
Head Start and all early childhood programs by showing that a
large national program that is well-implemented, maintains
quality, and focuses on specific child development goals for
children and parents can succeed," said Olivia A. Golden, HHS
assistant secretary for children and families. "There will be
more to learn, but we now know that the Early Head Start
blueprint of an early, intensive program can yield significant
results and brighter outcomes for children."</p>

<p>Early Head Start provides its full range of services in
home-based, center-based and mixed settings. The evaluation found
that the child development services provided directly by Early
Head Start programs were generally of high quality. Though there
were differences in results for children and parents among the
three program formats, overall findings regarding improvements in
children's cognitive development and parental behavior were broad
and substantial. Findings were strongest in programs that fully
implemented the Head Start performance standards. The preliminary
report covered children up to the age of 2. The study will
continue to assess their progress for another year.</p>

<p>Early Head Start was launched in 1995 based on recommendations
from the bipartisan Advisory Committee on Head Start appointed by
Secretary Shalala. There are currently 635 Early Head Start
programs serving 45,000 low-income children and their families.
Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. and Columbia University's
Center for Children and Families, in collaboration with the Early
Head Start Research Consortium, prepared the national evaluation,
which was begun in 1995. The evaluation studied approximately
3,000 children and families in 17 sites across the country during
the first two years of the children's lives.</p>

<p>The final report following children through age three will be
out next year. A copy of the preliminary study is available on
the ACF web site at <a
href="http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/news">http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/news</a>.</p>

documents, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education has
prepared a special document highlighting new programs in that
office.</p>

<p>Both documents provide basic information on Department of
Education initiatives and funding opportunities, as well as
application timelines and the name and contact information for a
person in the Department who will be available to answer
questions and provide information for the program.</p>

<p>We've included only those initiatives that we feel may be of
interest to the special education field.</p>

<p>NEW INITIATIVES</p>

<p>Urgent School Renovation Grant Program  -  $1.1 billion
Provides grants to local educational agencies to help them make
urgently needed repairs and to pay for special education and
technology-related technology expenses. Funds are distributed to
States based on Title I LEA grant shares. States distribute 75%
of their awards on a competitive basis to local educational
agencies to make urgently needed school repairs, such as repair
of roofs, plumbing and heating systems or meeting fire and safety
codes. The remaining 25% of a State's award is distributed
competitively to local educational agencies to use for technology
activities related to school renovation or for activities
authorized under Part B of the IDEA. School districts apply to
the State to receive funding for either purpose. For additional
information, contact Sylvia Wright at (202) 260-3778 or e-mail <a
href="mailto:sylvia_wright@ed.gov">sylvia_wright@ed.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Charter School Facilities Financing Demonstration Program  - 
$25 million Will support a competitive demonstration program that
will award one-time grants to three or more applicants. These
projects will demonstrate innovative credit enhancement
techniques that help charter schools meet the cost of acquiring,
constructing and renovating facilities by improving access to
private capital. Nonprofit agencies, public entities and
consortia of the two are eligible to apply for awards to
guarantee or insure debt or leases so that charter schools may
obtain or improve school facilities. Award recipients will also
use these funds to help charter schools identify and obtain loans
and to provide assistance in issuing debt, such as recruiting
bond counsel and underwriters. If possible, the program will fund
at least one project from each of the following three eligible
entities: a public entity, such as a State or local governmental
entity; a private entity; or a consortium of public and private
entities. For additional information, contact John Fiegel at
(202) 260-2671 or Sylvia Wright at (202) 260-3778.</p>

<p>Transition to Teaching - $31 million Helps local educational
agencies address their teacher shortages. The program provides
grants to encourage and assist talented mid-career professionals
working in other fields and recent college graduates with
outstanding academic records and baccalaureate degrees in fields
other than education to make successful career changes and become
licensed or certified teachers. Competitive grants will be
awarded to local educational agencies, state educational
agencies, educational service agencies, and nonprofit agencies
and organizations for recruitment, preparation, placement and
follow-up support activities conducted for this purpose. Some 72
awards will be made, including approximately 13 projects that
involve LEAs located in more than one state, 15 projects that
involve LEAs scattered across a particular state, and 44 projects
that involve a single LEA or a group of LEAs in a state in close
proximity to one another. Application packages should be
available in mid-January with an application deadline of March
20, 2001. For more information, contact Frances Yvonne Hicks at
(202) 260-0964, or e-mail Frances <a

<p>Early Childhood Educator Professional Development Program -
$10 million Will support high-quality professional development to
improve the knowledge and skills of early childhood educators who
work in early childhood programs located in urban or rural
high-poverty communities and serve primarily children from
low-income families. This training will be designed to improve
early childhood pedagogy and further children's language and
literacy skills to prevent them from encountering reading
difficulties when they enter school. These funds will be used for
competitive grants to consortia of one or more institutions of
higher education, State agencies for higher education, local
educational agencies, educational service agencies, State
educational agencies, and other public and private agencies,
organizations, and institutions such as child care consortiums,
and Head Start programs. The Department will award approximately
twenty grants, and the estimated range of the awards (per year)
is $300,000 - $700,000. The estimated average size of awards (per
year) is $500,000. Grants are available for up to four years
(dependent upon the availability of funding after 2001).
Applications should be available January 10th with a closing date
of March12, 2001. For more information regarding this program,
