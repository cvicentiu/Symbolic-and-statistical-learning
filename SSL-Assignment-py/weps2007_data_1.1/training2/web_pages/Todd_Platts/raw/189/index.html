<em>&quot;The scene in the Committee room was pretty amazing. I
have not seen anything like it on the Hill before. On one side of
the seating area in the Committee room were opponents of D.C.
school choice, all wearing stickers saying &quot;Stop DC Vouchers&quot;
handed out by a representative of the People for the American Way.
Ninety-nine percent of the voucher opponents were white. On the
other side of the room were supporters of vouchers. They were all
black, mostly women and children, wearing DC school choice t-shirts.&quot;</em>
-- From Capital Hillblogger<br>
<br>
The District of Columbia is ground zero for school choice. All
forces converge there. The District is home to the United States
Department of Education, the National Education Association, and
the American Federation of Teachers. The problem is very real
there. The Districts' students scored lower than all 50 states.
Seventy-two percent of black D.C. students read at below basic
level. The battle is dramatic and passionate. Congress is
debating funding of a pilot school voucher programs - only $75
million spread around the nation's troubled school districts; the
District of Columbia would receive $15 million. <br>
<br>
The debate has generated interesting intra-party battles. The
Wall Street Journal hammered two Republican congressmen for
opposing the D.C. voucher appropriation - they were justified in
the case of Rep. Todd Platts (R-PA) but less justified in their
condemnation of Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ.) Democrat D.C.
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton viciously reprimanded Democrat
Mayor Anthony Williams for supporting the measure. (Norton sends
her now-adult son to private Georgetown Day school.) And more
directly, African-American D.C. parents confronted essentially
all white opponents of D.C. vouchers in the House subcommittee
room (described above.)<br>
<br>
Sadly the case for expanding the use of school vouchers grows
stronger as more and more students fail. The distressing
statistics keep piling up, as various teacher union groups, the
ACLU, and the People for the American Way work to stop school
voucher experimentation. No where is that more apparent (or
transparent) than in the nation's capitol.<br>
<br>
Columnist Deroy Murdoch recently documented the District's
problems. He reported that the National Education Association
ranks the D.C. Public Schools above the 50 states in
expenditures, $13,078 per pupil vs. a $7,463 U.S. average. D.C.
has a 42 percent high school dropout rate, versus 31 percent
nationwide. Eighty-five percent of D.C. graduates at the
University of District of Columbia require remedial instruction.
On the 2000 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 6
percent of eighth-graders performed grade-level math, versus 31
percent nationwide. Ten percent of fourth-graders read at grade
level, versus 35 percent nationwide. Almost 37 percent of D.C.
adults read only at a third-grade level. Not surprising, four of
13 D.C. city council members have send their kids to private
schools. <br>
<br>
The pressure is on Congress to enact a school voucher test
program. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies
&quot;National Opinion Poll&quot; found that 57 percent of
African Americans support school choice and in the parenting age
group support rises to 70.4 percent of African Americans (between
the age of 26 and 35.) A 2002 Zogby poll asked a very specific
voucher question - that is, allowing &quot;poor parents to be
given the tax dollars allotted for their child's education and
permitting them to use those dollars in the form of a scholarship
to attend a private, public or parochial school of their choosing.&quot;
Overall, 63 percent supported the proposal with 72% of African-Americans
strongly supporting.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the District of Columbia's educational bureaucracy
languishes. Its school budget was increased to $922 million this
year, but the district is still over budget. The personnel budget
will be overspent by $31 million this fiscal year unless there
are layoffs. This year's budget calls for 10,691 employees, but
11,330 are on the payroll. (It took 18 months for administrators
to tally those numbers.) There are 71 school employees receiving
paychecks whose duties can't be determined, and no one is certain
if they are even reporting for work. The school district has paid
a financial consultant $280,000 over the past six months to
&quot;identify problems that have caused overspending.&quot; (Talon
News, Jeff Gannon)<br>
<br>
And then there's the corruption issue. The Washington Teachers
Union's labor bosses allegedly embezzled $5 million in membership
dues to purchase antiques, fine art, furs and more. <br>
<br>
The problem is at the steps of Congress, literally. Elsewhere,
there has been progress. Milwaukee has 11,000 students using
vouchers, Cleveland, 5,000, and Florida, 650. A newly passed
voucher bill passed in the Colorado Legislature, potentially
providing vouchers for nearly 17,000 students by 2007. <br>
<br>
It may take another year or two; the District of Columbia voucher
program may die in the Senate. That will mean another year for
thousands of the District's students to suffer. But at ground
zero, in the nation's capitol, another year will only increase
the urgency and intensify the need to act. Eventually, courageous
democrats like D.C. Mayor Williams will force Congress to take
control of its school district - the District of Columbia school
district - and save the kids under its care. <br>
