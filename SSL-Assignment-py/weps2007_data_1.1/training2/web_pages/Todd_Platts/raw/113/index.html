-  December 3 - Green Party officials extended a

blunt warning to three additional congressional

incumbents today, promising that Green Party

challengers will run aggressive campaigns against them

and six other incumbents based upon support for Fast

Track legislation currently before Congress.



<p>"Our message to these incumbents is clear:  You vote

for Fast Track on Thursday, you'll lose votes to us

next November," said Nathalie Paravicini, Secretary of

the Green Party of the United States.



<p>The Green Party released a new list of nine targeted

Democratic and Republican members of Congress against

whom they intend to run serious challenges:



<p>REPRESENTATIVE TODD PLATTS (R-PA, 19) - Coming from a

strong progressive tradition, Ben Price of Carlisle,

PA has taken on Platts, a Republican incumbent who his

critics in the labor movement accuse of betraying the

interests of working people with his support of Fast

Track.  Ben Price is the current President of the

Pennsylvania Consumer Action Network (PCAN), a

powerful statewide coalition fighting for universal

health care, electoral reform, the environment and

other issues.



<p>"My campaign is about justice, jobs, and peace, all

issues the old parties seem to have forgotten,"

declared Price, who is seeking the 

nomination of local Green Party locals, "Having just

elected 13 new Greens in Pennsylvania this November,

the Greens plan to win by vividly showing voters that

we are the party working on things people care about

in their everyday lives."



<p>REPRESENTATIVE BARON HILL (D-IN, 9) - Social

psychologist Jeff Melton has declared his candidacy

for the Green Party nomination in south central

Indiana, where he intends to take on incumbent "New

Democrat" Rep. Baron Hill.  The 9th District is home

to the Indiana University-Bloomington, a politically

active and progressive campus community that provided

heavy support to the 2000 Nader/LaDuke ticket; it is

also home to thousands of electrical, steel, and other

industrial workers who have suffered years of lay-offs

due to job export and corporate downsizing by Thomson

Electronics (RCA), General Electric, Otis Elevator,

and other major corporations.



<p>"The American labor movement may be wedded to the

Democratic Party, but it's an abusive relationship. 

So-called 'free trade' agreements supported by

Democrats like Baron Hill have been a black eye for

American workers, costing thousands of previously

well-paid union workers here in the 9th District their

livelihoods. Hill solicits campaign contributions from

labor unions by pretending to be a friend of working

people, but so far he's mainly been a friend to

sweatshops and corporate polluters, not workers," said

Green candidate Jeff Melton.



<p>REPRESENTATIVE VIC SNYDER (D-AR, 2) - Following their

recent first-time congressional race in a 3rd District

special election in which Green candidate Sarah Marsh

captured 1.8% of the vote, Arkansas Greens are now

considering taking on Democrat Vic Snyder in the 2002

elections.



<p>"It appears to us that Snyder is soft on Fast Track,

and that puts him at odds not only with the Green

Party but also with most of his working class

constituents.  So, with the right combination of a

candidate, organization and Snyder's vulnerability on

Fast Track issues, I am sure that Greens in Little

Rock will take long hard look at taking him on.  Of

course, if he's willing to "mend his ways" regarding

Fast Track and other core issues, they might decide to

focus their energies elsewhere,"  said Ed Tarvin,

Campaign Organizer of the just-completed Sarah Marsh

campaign.



<p>REPRESENTATIVE BOB CLEMENT (D-TN, 5) - Rep. Clement

faces a growing challenge from mathematics professor

Dr. Jonathan D. Farley, of Vanderbilt University in

Nashville. Dr. Farley, an advocate of reparations for

slavery and segregation, is a rising star who has been

featured recently in Essence Magazine, the hip-hop

magazine The Source, and Ebony as a "Leader of the

Future."



<p>"My opponent is a favorite of the corporate lobby, and

they are counting on him to deliver on Fast Track.

But, thanks to pressure from the Greens, he may oppose

it," said Dr. Farley. "If he doesn't, come next

November, Congressman 'Inclement' may just get

down-sized."



<p>REPRESENTATIVE NORM DICKS (D-WA, 3); REPRESENTATIVE

ADAM SMITH (D-WA, 9) - Prominent Greens in Washington

state, frustrated with the unresponsiveness of

Representative Dicks and Smith both to respectful

appeals and to picketing by Greens and labor activists

regarding their respective trade stances, have made a

public appeal for candidates to challenge them. Rep.

Dicks is considered a firm "yes" vote on Fast Track

and Rep. Smith is considered to be on the fence;

Greens consider both to be vulnerable in their

reelection bids.



<p>Washington Greens have reason to expect success: Last

year, Green Party candidate Joe Szwaja won 20% of the

vote in his challenge of Rep. Jim McDermott, and

political observers have noted McDermott's recent

leadership in questioning the bombing of Afghanistan

and fighting the passage of Fast Track.



<p>"Our message to Representatives Dicks and Smith is

crystal clear: You won't be able to take the

progressive vote for granted, we're going to speak for

the interests of workers, consumers, and nature, and

we will define the issues in this campaign," said

Szwaja, the most successful Green Party candidate for

federal office thus far in the United States.



<p>REPRESENTATIVE GERALD KLECZKA (D-WI, 4) - Greater

Milwaukee Green Party member Brian Merrill Vasquez

Verdin has announced an anti-war pro-democracy

campaign for the Green Party nomination for Congress.

Verdin is a member of the International Association of

Machinists union (IAM) with deep roots in the labor

movement and Milwaukee's Latino community. Verdin

expects to face incumbent Rep. Kleczka after

redistricting next year.  Although Kleczka has said he

may vote against Fast Track legislation, Milwaukee

Greens say he's failed to lead on the issue and will

be held electorally accountable for the outcome of the

vote.



<p>"I want to join Barbara Lee. I want to be one more

congressperson who will stand with Barbara Lee and say

'Hell No!' to war, Fast Track, and corporate

profiteering," said Verdin.



<p>REPRESENTATIVE MARK GREEN (R-WI, 8) - Rep. Green can

soon expect to face a serious Green Party challenger

in northeast Wisconsin, as his likely opponent will

announce her candidacy within two weeks. The Wisconsin

Green Party has committed to this race in the 8th

District, a region that is home to many Green Party

locals.  Rep.Green is currently considered to be a

fence-sitter on Fast Track.



<p>REPRESENTATIVE RON KIND (D-WI, 3) - Rep. Kind has

significantly angered western Wisconsin dairy farmers

and steelworkers with his past voting record on trade

issues, and is considered vulnerable in this

independent-minded district that gave the Nader/LaDuke

ticket some of its best percentages in 2000. Kind is

considered to be leaning in favor of a 'yes' vote on

Fast Track even though thousands of workers in his

district have lost their jobs at La Crosse Boot,

Heileman Brewery, Rayovac, Lands End, and other

factories due to trade-related job exports. The

Wisconsin Green Party is actively recruiting

candidates in the 3rd District and is committed to the

race.



<p>The above races are against congressional incumbents

considered key to the upcoming Fast Track vote. Greens

also have declared their candidacies for Congress in

California (41st) and Nevada (1st), and are gearing up

to run serious campaigns in hundreds of other

congressional and statewide races next year. Over 277

Greens vied for federal, state, and local office in

2001, and at least 55 of these won election.



<p>"Green Party congressional candidates will fight to

defend American sovereignty against anti-democratic

trade pacts, and we will campaign to hold

congressional incumbents accountable for their

betrayal of working people and the environment," said

Ben Manski, Co-Chair of 

the Green Party of the United States.



<p>H.R. 3005 would grant Fast Track trade negotiation

powers to the President and represents a substantial

transfer of Congress' constitutionally-mandated

authority over trade to the executive branch. Greens

join with the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, Friends of the

Earth, Public Citizen, and hundreds of other unions,

civil rights, environmental, student, farm, and

democracy groups in strongly opposing the bill. Greens

generally oppose the establishment of trade agreements

which undermine democracy and erode environmental,

labor, and civil rights protections. Greens

specifically oppose the granting of Presidential Fast

Track authority because of the perception that the

Presidency is insensitive to citizen concerns about

trade policy.
