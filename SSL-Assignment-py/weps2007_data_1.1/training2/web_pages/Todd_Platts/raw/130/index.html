      General and Mrs. Hagee, General and Mrs. Jones, General Myers, General Pace, 
      members of the Joint Chiefs, distinguished Ambassadors, members of the House 
      and Senate. I see Pat Leahy; thank you for coming. Former Senator Chuck 
      Robb. I saw the former Governor of California, Pete Wilson, here; there 
      you are; and Representatives Ellen Tauscher, Todd Platts, Stenny Hoyer, 
      John Kline, and others, if you&#8217;re here; Admiral Naughton. I am pleased 
      to be back here at the Academy. Men and women of the Marine Corps, ladies 
      and gentlemen. 
      <p>I am delighted to be here in Annapolis again at what some would like 
        to call not the Naval Academy, but the Marine Corps Academy. Quite a few 
        here today like that. Today we salute an outstanding commandant of the 
        Marine Corps for a job well done, and we celebrate the arrival of an exceedingly 
        well-qualified man to assume the leadership of the United States Marines. 
      </p>
      <p>These two men have spent a lifetime standing up for the Corps and standing 
        up for the country. Commandant James L. Jones leaves tomorrow to become 
        Commander of U.S. European Command with the NATO hat of Supreme Allied 
        Commander, Europe. And General Mike Hagee comes to us from the 1st Marine 
        Expeditionary Force, the new Commandant.</p>
      <p>Between them, I&#8217;m told they have some 70 years in the Corps. They 
        know the grave consequences of war. They have fought with energy and intellect 
        to keep America safe and our people secure. </p>
      <p>People from dozens of nations, of all races and religions, were attacked 
        on September 11th. We were attacked basically because of who we are, a 
        free people. And to live as free people in this 21st century, our country 
        must be able to defend our way of life against the forces of terror and 
        fear. We are truly fortunate to have men and women of courage who are 
        able to look over the horizon, and to see what is possible, and to help 
        in transforming our military to meet the new challenges that we face in 
        this dangerous new century.</p>
      <p>Jim Jones is a man of courage. His heroism in Vietnam earned him the 
        Silver Star. </p>
      <p>General Jones is dedicated to transforming the Marines for the 21st century. 
        He knows that the new military must be flexible, nimble and forward-looking. 
      </p>
      <p>To create a powerful force against terrorism, Jim reactivated the 4th 
        Marine Expeditionary Brigade; and with his colleague, Chief of Naval Operations 
        Vern Clark, he launched a bold plan to integrate Navy and Marine Corps 
        aviation -- including putting Marine fighter squadrons on the decks of 
        every Navy aircraft carrier. He&#8217;s also initiated a new bond between 
        the Marines and the U.S. Special Forces Command. Marines and the Special 
        Forces, both extraordinarily quick and agile, can be even more capable 
        when working closely together. </p>
      <p>General Jones has strongly supported the families behind the Marines 
        as well. He gave new life to the Exceptional Family Member Program. And 
        Diane Jones, thank you also for all you have done for Marine families.</p>
      <p>Jim leaves his position as Commandant to cross the Atlantic to become 
        the fourteenth Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, the first Marine officer 
        to hold this position. Indeed, he is the first officer from the naval 
        services to be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. He follows a long line 
        of great leaders: Eisenhower, Norstad, Lemnitzer, and most recently, Joe 
        Ralston. Jim Jones is in that fine tradition. </p>
      <p>As the top military official in NATO, General Jones will bring a valuable 
        perspective to this important alliance. Marines excel at expeditionary 
        operations, to swiftly project combat power over long distances, often 
        in difficult, austere environments. Our NATO allies are currently transforming 
        themselves, as we are, to become more relevant to this 21st century. <br>
        Indeed, transformation is as important to NATO as it is to our Department 
        of Defense. Jim, we wish you well on your trip to an important assignment. 
        Good luck and Godspeed to you and to Diane. </p>
      <p>And today we welcome General Mike Hagee. </p>
      <p>From the hills of southeast Texas in the 1960s, Mike demonstrated both 
        academic and athletic prowess here at this academy. In the 35 years since 
        then, we have seen what he can do. </p>
      <p>He showed dynamic leadership in Vietnam and served at the Central Intelligence 
        Agency and at the Pentagon, and has held every command at every echelon, 
        from platoon to Marine Expeditionary Force. </p>
      <p>With his superb background, I know he&#8217;ll build, shape and continue 
        transforming the Marines for the future.</p>
      <p>You know, unless you&#8217;re a Mozart or an Einstein, and you go off 
        in a room by yourself and do something terrific, all the rest of us, whatever 
        it is we do, we do it with other people. And the one thing I&#8217;ve 
        always considered among my most important tasks is to try to find truly 
        talented people -- people we can learn from, people with integrity and 
        energy, who are willing to think differently and take risks, and do the 
        kinds of things necessary to leave an institution better than they found 
        it. </p>
      <p>Over the course of my career, I have worked hard at trying to find the 
        most talented people. I&#8217;m proud to say that when I was -- back in 
        1969, I guess I was in my early 30s, and I was the Director of the Office 
        of Economic Opportunity, I hired a young graduate student in his 20s, 
        to serve as my special assistant, Dick Cheney. The same month I hired 
        another man, who also became Secretary of Defense, literally in the same 
        month, and that was Frank Carlucci. </p>
      <p>One of the most important things that the President and the Secretary 
        of Defense do during their tenure is to select the military leaders to 
        lead our armed forces into the future. So, it&#8217;s not surprising that 
        over the past 2 years, General Dick Myers, the Chairman of Chiefs, and 
        General Pete Pace, the Vice Chairman, and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz 
        and I have spent an enormous amount of time looking at the many, many 
        talented people in the Department of Defense, and looking for the very, 
        very best talent to fill the top 20, 30 posts in the U.S. Armed Forces 
        -- before making a recommendation to the President.</p>
      <p>The President has made an outstanding choice in selecting Mike Hagee 
        to lead the Marine Corps in this time of challenge and change. He has 
        a brilliant career behind him, and still brighter prospects ahead. </p>
      <p>The President has made a promise to our nation and the world. He made 
        that promise shortly after the September 11th attacks. He said, &#8220;We 
        will not waver; we will not tire; we will not falter. And we will not 
        fail.&#8221; </p>
      <p>You -- the men and women of the Marine Corps, along with your colleagues 
        in the other services, are the ones who will deliver on that promise. 
        You are the ones who will win the global war on terror. As our nation 
        fights the global war on terror, you need, and you deserve, the very best 
        possible leadership -- and in General Mike Hagee, you will have it.</p>
      <p>We are proud to welcome General Hagee as the 33rd Commandant of the Marine 
        Corps. Mike, we salute you, and we salute Silke, and we wish you well 
        in this critical assignment. Congratulations.</p>
