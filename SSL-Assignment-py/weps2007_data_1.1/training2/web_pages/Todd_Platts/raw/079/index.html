<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

As I sit here, I am having a difficult time writing this column, probably because I'm not sure that we as a community can really look forward to a happy new year. George Bush has won the election for president. He immediately began appointing some rabidly anti-gay people to positions of power in the federal government. If Bush is consistent, we can expect a similar mind set amongst his appointments to the US Supreme Court where Renquist and Sandra Day O'Connor had both expressed a desire to retire - but only if a republican was elected president. Because of the age of some of the other justices, Bush has a good chance of shifting the Supreme Court to the ideological right for many years to come. Since many cases are now decided 5-4, this shift would not bode well for the GLBT community. Closer to home, Congressman Goodling, who had a terrible record on gay issues, was replaced by Todd Platts. This is no improvement where the gay community is concerned - after all, Todd believes an employer should not have to hire us if that employer doesn't want to associate with homosexuals. He doesn't feel the same way about a Jewish employer who doesn't want to associate with Christians or a white employer who doesn't want to associate with blacks since he is not opposed to existing anti-discrimination laws. This is one reason I did not vote for Todd Platts - I don't believe any official who will not stand up for my basic civil rights is capable of representing me.<br>
Yet many in the GLBT community simply see this as an annoying setback and anticipate a brighter future as we continue to move forward. In Vermont we have gained the right to legally recognized unions. The voters reaffirmed that right in the same election that brought Bush to power. The number of states with sodomy laws is constantly decreasing. If this trend continues, we will soon be able to go anywhere in the US without fear of being arrested simply because we exist. Recently a group of activists went to Rome to confront the Pope on the Church's anti-gay attitudes and teachings. During their 4 day visit they were basically ignored but they still planted seeds which, hopefully, will someday blossom and bear fruit. Many more are continuing to work at bringing change and enlightenment within the various religious communities. In Lancaster, a 20 year old is starting a new group for gay teens. By helping these youth come to terms with their own existence, helping them avoid much of the pain many of us grew up with, the road is being paved for a future generation which will expect and achieve everything we are working for today.<br>
No movement ever achieved its goals without some setbacks. It seems for every three steps we manage to take forward we are forced to take two steps back. But as long as there are individuals and groups willing to take on the challenges of helping the GLBT community achieve its goals, the fight continues and the gay community will continue to move forward. And any year we manage to move forward should be viewed as a good year. So yes, I think we can look forward to a happy new year.

<h1><i>SOULFORCE</i></h1>
<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="soulforce.jpg">
<i>from the soulforce website, Jan. 2, 2001:</i><br><br>
As rain fell on the streets of Rome, the Soulforce - Dignity/USA delegation of 21 activists ventured out for a morning ritual at the Circus Maximus, where Christian martyrs met death at the hands of the Romans 1000s of years ago. As the sun broke through the clouds, a rainbow appeared, a sign of love and peace to begin 4 days of non-violent actions at the Vatican.<br><br>
 <b><i>What is Soulforce?</b></i> <br>
Soulforce is named for Gandhi's teaching of satyagraha, Gandhi's term for "truth force" or "soul force," which he defined as a plan of action that developed inner lives while working to transform society. These soul force principles guide many nonviolent justice movements, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s fight for racial equality.<br><br>
 <i><b> Soulforce Mission </b></i><br>
Determined to help end the suffering of Gods lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered children...<br>
Determined to help change the minds and hearts of religious leaders whose anti-homosexual campaigns lead (directly and indirectly) to that suffering...
Determined to be guided in our every action by SOULFORCE - the principles of relentless nonviolent resistance as lived and taught by M.K. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr...<br>
And in the process of bringing hope and healing to our society, find redirection and renewal for our minds and spirits.<br><br>
 <b><i> Soulforce Strategy </b></i><br>
Soulforce Inc. is a non-profit organization located in Laguna Beach, California, co-founded and run by the Rev. Dr. Mel White and his partner, Gary Nixon. Soulforce operates as an ecumenical network of volunteers committed to teaching and applying the principles of nonviolence on behalf of sexual minorities.<br>
 White believes he is called to work directly with religious leaders and bring the truth to them about homosexuality. "We must continue fighting the antigay political actions. We must continue helping those who suffer. But we must also work to cut off that suffering at its source. That's why we launched Soulforce," White explains. "The toxic rhetoric flows unabated, primarily from sincere but misinformed religious leaders. It is poisoning the national discourse, dividing homes and churches, ruining families and wasting lives. We must do our best to stop that flow of poison at its source, and the 'soul force' rules of nonviolent resistance show us how."<br><br>

On Wed., January 17th, Laura Montgomery Rutt, Soulforce Media Coordinator, will be appearing on Gay York Live! to discuss her experiences with Soulforce and the Vatican demonstration. Because it will be a live presentation, viewers will be able to phone in questions by calling 846-5067 between 6 and 7pm. You can also find out more about Soulforce by going to www.soulforce.org on the web.

<h1>GLBT Movie Night</h1><br><br>

Have you seen a good GLBT movie lately? You now have the opportunity to see one on the first Friday of each month. In December the Welcoming Committee of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of York began hosting a GLBT movie night. That first video was <b><i>The Truth About Jane </b></i>followed by <b><i>Rites of Passage </b></i>in January. On February 2nd at 7pm, they will be showing <b><i>It's In the Water</b></i>. These videos are open to the public and will be shown at the UUCY's main building, 925 S. George St., York.  Anyone wishing to attend should call 846-2560.<br><br>
<b><i><center><h2> It's In the Water </h2></center></b></i><br>
In the small southern town of Azalea Springs, the country club still sets the rules. Here, being a member of "The League" is a must and only hair dressers and interior designers are supposed to be gay. A frenzy breaks out when a tipsy comment starts a rumor that the local drinking water turns you gay. This unexpected spark adds fuel to the already smoldering fires as the religious and socially righteous begin to join forces. The combination becomes a catalyst for residents who must now face or deny their own realities in this outrageous comedy with a queer little twist.

Even the founders of these ex-gay ministries aren't 'cured' of anything, and often go right back to being gay. Ultimately, these groups have no interest in loving gays--they just want to exploit the hatred of homosexuals through fundraising. We are the modern- day 'red scare,' and the easiest buck in town.

Interspersed with this material will be live segments with a variety of guests. So mark your calendars and tune in to York Cable 16 and celebrate Gay Pride with us. And be sure to check future issues of the Chronicles for more information about the marathon and other gay pride events as that information becomes available.

Self-esteem isn't built by wearing butless
chaps at an all-gay event straight people won't attend. <br>It's bringing a male date to the company picnic.<br> Pride isn't forged because you sit in the back of a convertible wearing a dress.<br> It's earned when you don't let go of your boyfriend's hand, <br>even when you see straight people coming. <br>Self-respect doesn't come because you flash your tits to a drunk crowd.<br>It comes from telling that nice lady sitting next to you on the plane <br>the real reason why some young man hasn't snatched you up yet.<b><i><br><b>
