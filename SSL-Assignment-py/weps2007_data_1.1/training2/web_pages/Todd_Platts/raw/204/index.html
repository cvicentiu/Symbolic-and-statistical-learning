    <p>On April 30, Congress left Washington, D.C., with the sun ready to set on 
    yet another month without a deal brokered on the Budget Resolution for 
    fiscal year 2005. Disagreements over the &quot;PAYGO&quot; provisions continue to 
    stall the mundane budgetary process. Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans 
    are increasingly pressuring their leadership to fund vital domestic 
    programs.<br>
    PAYGO provisions refer to budget reconciliation language directing 
    congressional appropriation committees to &quot;pay&quot; for any proposed tax cuts or 
    spending increases with monies already in the budget (for example, cutting 
    funding somewhere else in the budget). The language is an attempt to regain 
    control over the annual federal budget deficit, which has ballooned to over 
    $450 billion.<br>
    &quot;It’s now or never for budget conferees. Scant information is being released 
    on their progress since it may thwart sensitive negotiations on issues such 
    as PAYGO,&quot; summarized Dustin May, Legislative Director for Powers, Pyles, 
    Sutter and Verville, a Washington-based health care practice. &quot;The PAYGO 
    issue is the 800-pound gorilla preventing a final budget resolution being 
    completed. At this point in negotiations, it is likely that multiple PAYGO 
    proposals are being floated in order to secure the necessary 51 votes for 
    final passage on the Senate floor.&quot;<br>
    The delays, however, have not stopped lawmakers from actively trying to 
    influence the process. It is becomingly increasingly clear that 
    congressional Republicans are pressuring their leadership to forego cuts to 
    domestic spending. Many of these efforts would be extremely beneficial to 
    programs vital to providing the necessary services and supports to the 
    HIV/AIDS communities.<br>
    House Republican leaders – specifically House Budget Chairman Jim Nussle, 
    R-Iowa – have increasingly been under pressure to allocate more funding for 
    HIV-related programs, both foreign and domestic. Roll Call, which is a 
    Washington, D.C., newspaper circulated only on Capitol Hill, first reported 
    that religious leaders and AIDS advocates have been criticizing the 
    Nussle-authored budget for failing to meet the needs of the international 
    HIV/AIDS communities. According to the April 24 edition of Roll Call, 
    Lutheran, Catholic, Presbyterian and ecumenical leaders from Nussle’s Iowa 
    congressional district are &quot;gently warning&quot; him to approve more funding for 
    AIDS initiatives.<br>
    Last month, Reps. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., 
    circulated a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter that pleaded with Chairman Nussle to 
    remove language from the conference report that would effectively cut $2.2 
    billion in Medicaid spending over five years. The effort being spearheaded 
    by Burr and Boehlert is also being supported by 26 House Republicans.<br>
    &quot;I am very pleased that 26 of my colleagues joined me in sending this letter 
    asking for the removal of the House budget resolution Medicaid language,&quot; 
    Representative Burr said of his Dear Colleague letter. &quot;Given our country’s 
    current situation with high numbers of unemployed and uninsured individuals 
    who depend on their states’ Medicaid programs for health care, the federal 
    government should not reduce its commitment to those programs.&quot;<br>
    House Republicans who also signed the Burr-Boehlert letter are Rob Simmons 
    (Conn.), Robin Hayes (N.C.), Randy Cunningham (Calif.), John McHugh (N.Y.), 
    Jim Leach (Iowa), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Peter King (N.Y.), Jim 
    Gerlach (Pa.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Donald Manzullo (Ill.), Greg Walden 
    (Ore.), Jim Ramstad (Minn.), George Radanovich (Calif.), Mary Bono (Calif.), 
    Ralph Hall (Texas), Todd Platts (Pa.), George Nethercutt (Wash.), 
    Christopher Smith (N.J.), Ron Paul (Texas), Tim Johnson (Ill.), Christopher 
    Cox (Calif.), Max Burns (Ga.), Jon Porter (Nev.), Jeff Miller (Fla.) and Jo 
    Ann Emerson (Mo.).<br>
    The proposed $2.2 billion reduction in Medicaid spending included in the 
    House-passed Budget Resolution has been identified as a serious concern for 
    the HIV/AIDS community because nearly 55 percent of all persons with AIDS 
    receive their medical care through Medicaid. While the Republican leadership 
    in Congress attempts to control domestic discretionary spending, other 
    more-moderate GOPers are fighting to protect this vital HIV/AIDS funding.<br>
    The American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted 
    Living praised the Burr-Boehlert letter, calling it growing evidence that 
    the GOP wants to forego cutting vital services to seniors and individuals 
    with disabilities.<br>
    &quot;We are encouraged that 27 GOP House members are voicing their support for 
    the many seniors and persons with disabilities who have already been 
    subjected to cuts in the benefits and services that make a real difference 
    in their lives,&quot; stated Charles H. Roadman II, President and CEO of AHCA/NCAL. 
    &quot;We are hopeful the budget conferees will recognize $2.2 billion in Medicaid 
    cuts will jeopardize care access, and threaten the progress we are making to 
    improve quality in long-term care.&quot;<br>
    Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., initiated a similar move in the Senate by writing 
    a letter to Senate Budget Chairman Don Nickles, R-Okla. Smith stressed the 
    need to &quot;protect&quot; Medicaid from future cuts in any conference agreement.<br>
    The letter reads: &quot;Recognizing the importance of the Medicaid program, the 
    Senate-passed Budget Resolution does not contain reconciliation instructions 
    to the Finance Committee on Medicaid. We are concerned to see, however, that 
    the House directed the Committee on Energy and Commerce to make cuts to the 
    Medicaid program. Such cuts will leave more people without health insurance 
    and further tax the providers’ ability to serve this vulnerable population.&quot;
    <br>
    As states have been forced to cut their Medicaid budgets over the last 
    several years, lawmakers are increasingly finding it hard to sit idle as 
    they hear more and more stories from constituents. In Florida for example, 
    recent news reports mentioned in The Weekly News documented that Palm Beach 
    and Broward counties are receiving fewer federal dollars (See April 1 issue,
    <i>twnonline.org</i>).<br>
    Meanwhile, other senators have also expressed concern over the lack of 
    funding being allocated for the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs authorized 
    under the Ryan White Care Act. Ryan White provides medical care assistance 
    to those with low incomes and little or no insurance. Approximately $1 
    billion annually goes toward comprehensive care programs, which include 
    health care, support services and drug assistance programs. Most of the 
    funding is made available for ADAPs to provide anti-retroviral therapy, as 
    well as to purchase health insurance for eligible clients. <br>
    Smith was accompanied by Sens. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, Dick Durbin, D-Ill., 
    and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., in writing to Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Joe 
    Lieberman, D-Conn., who serve respectively as Chairman and Ranking Member on 
    the Senate Subcommittee on Labor-Health and Human Services-Education 
    appropriations. They asked for an additional $217 million increase for the 
    cash-strapped ADAPs.<br>
    &quot;Some states are fortunate enough to have additional funding through their 
    own commitments as well as the support of local communities,&quot; reads their 
    letter. &quot;Yet, there are dozens of states that find themselves unable to keep 
    up with the demand for coverage under ADAP. As documented in the annual 
    National ADAP Monitoring Report, some states are being forced to take 
    drastic measures to offset the federal funding shortfall, including 
    establishing waiting lists for AIDS medications, reducing drug coverage and 
    restricting eligibility.&quot;<br>
    Additionally, SAVE ADAP sent an alert to its grassroots network, encouraging 
    them to contact their congressional delegation. &quot;There are close to 1,300 
    people on waiting lists for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program across the 
    United States,&quot; read the action alert. &quot;Help put an end to this crisis today 
    by urging your representative to sign an important ‘Dear Colleague’ letter!&quot;<br>
    While the fate of the Budget Resolution remains unclear, it is increasingly 
    likely in this election year that many programs originally slated to be cut 
    will be spared. Advocates are certainly doing their part to make sure that 
    message is heard loud and clear in Washington.<br>
    <b>Note: Dear Colleague letters are circulated by Members of Congress 
    amongst their colleagues in their respective chambers asking for their 
    endorsement or sign-on regarding pending legislation.</b></p>
