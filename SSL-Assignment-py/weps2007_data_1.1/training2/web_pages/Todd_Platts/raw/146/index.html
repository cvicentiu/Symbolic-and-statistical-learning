            <h1><b> Congressional Fever of Israel-Fealty Intensifying</b></h1>
            <h2><B> </b><I>By Shirl McArthur</i></h2>
            <P> <I> </i>While both Republican and Democratic members of Congress
              have for decades engaged in an unseemly competition for Jewish-American
              votes and contributions, usually by expressing their continual
              and blind support for Israel, this past spring has seen them figuratively
              falling all over each other to convincingly express their fealty
              to Israel and commitment to causes seen as of interest to Jewish
              Americans. This is at least partially because many political pundits
              see President George W. Bush’s abandonment of even a pretext of
              even-handedness in Arab-Israeli matters as eroding Democrats’ traditional
              advantage in American Jewish electoral and financial support. This
              premise is questionable, however, because—as other pundits point
              out—many American Jews are drawn to the Democratic Party because
              of issues unrelated to Israel, and many others do not see the current
              Israeli government’s policies as being in Israel’s long-term interest.</P>
            <P> AIPAC’s annual conference has long attracted large numbers of
              members of Congress from both parties to express their undying
              support for Israel, but this year’s meeting seemed to garner an
              even greater outpouring of congressional support, with more than
              half the members of Congress attending at least one function. Both
              House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) and Minority Whip Steny
              Hoyer (D-MD) apparently bought into Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
              Sharon’s attempts to link the U.S. global campaign against terrorism
              with Israel’s attempts to crush the Palestinian people. They either
              do not see or do not care that it is precisely this linkage between
              U.S. military actions in the Middle East and Israeli actions in
              Palestine that cause most people in the Middle East to be suspicious
              of American motives and objectives in the region.</P>
            <h2> <B>Pro-Israel Bills Gain Support</b></h2>
            <P> <B> </b>On the legislative front, H.Con.Res. 371, introduced
              in February by Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN), “supporting the construction
              by Israel of a security fence to prevent Palestinian terrorist
              attacks and condemning the decision by the U.N. General Assembly
              [UNGA] to request the International Court of Justice [ICJ] to render
              an opinion on the legality of the security fence,” has gained 10
              co-sponsors since those mentioned in previous issues of the <I>Washington
              Report,</I> and now has 156, including Pence. New co-sponsors are
              Reps. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), Bud Cramer (D-AL), Chris John (D-LA),
              James Langevin (R-RI), Jim Marshall (D-GA), Dennis Moore (D-KS),
              Todd Platts (R-PA), Linda Sanchez (D-CA), Bart Stupak (D-MI), and
              Ed Whitfield (R-KY).</P>
            <h3> <I>The U.S. should “seek an immediate end to the inequality experienced
                by Israel in the U.N.”</i></h3>
            <P> <I> </i>In addition, H.Con.Res. 390, introduced by Rep. Gary
              Ackerman (D-NY) in March “condemning the adoption of [UNGA] Resolution
              ES-10/14 (Dec. 8, 2003) which requests the ICJ to render an advisory
              opinion concerning the international legal consequences arising
              from Israel’s construction of a security fence in parts of the
              West Bank,” and expressing the continued U.S. commitment “to Israel’s
              right to exist as a Jewish democratic state, its security and its
              right of self-defense, including the right to build a security
              fence as a direct consequence of more than three years of barbaric
              Palestinian terrorism,” has gained seven co-sponsors since those
              named in the previous issue of this magazine, and now has 32, including
              Ackerman.New co-sponsors are Reps. Bachus, Cramer, Peter Deutsch
              (D-FL), Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Charles Rangel (D-NY), Steve Rothman
              (D-NJ), and Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD).</P>
            <P> On April 28, Rep. Martin Frost (D-TX) introduced H.R. 4235, “to
              allow the export or other provision of oil to Israel.” In seeking
              co-sponsors, Frost said his bill would extend into law certain
              provisions of the expired Export Administration Act that authorized
              the president to export oil or to secure oil supplies for Israel.
              The bill has 13 co-sponsors, all Democrats: Reps. Ackerman, Dennis
              Cardoza (CA), Steve Israel (NY), Tom Lantos (CA), Nita Lowey (NY),
              Ed Markey (MA), Michael McNulty (NY), Ciro Rodriguez (TX), Janice
              Schakowsky (IL), Adam Schiff (CA), Henry Waxman (CA), Anthony Weiner
              (NY), and Robert Wexler (FL).</P>
            <P> On May 12 House International Relations Committee (HIRC) Middle
              East subcommittee Chair Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) introduced
              three non-binding resolutions, H.Res. 615, 616, and 617, whose
              primary purpose seemed to be to burnish her (and indirectly the
              Republicans’) standing among Jewish Americans.</P>
            <P> Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the three resolutions have
              nearly the same list of co-sponsors, nearly all dependable Israel-firsters.
              In addition to Ros-Lehtinen, 15 members co-sponsor all three resolutions:
              Reps. Howard Berman (D-CA), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Dan Burton (R-IN),
              Steve Chabot (R-OH), Ben Chandler (D-KY), JoAnn Davis (R-VA), Eliot
              Engel (D-NY), Peter King (R-NY), Thaddeus McCotter (R-MI), McNulty,
              Pence, Brad Sherman (D-CA), John Shimkus (R-IL), Chris Smith (R-NJ),
              and Wexler. Also co-sponsoring H.Res. 615 and 617 are Reps. Shelley
              Berkley (D-NV), Henry Brown (R-SC), Joe Crowley (D-NY), Lantos,
              Charlie Norwood (R-GA), and Jim Saxton (R-NJ). Co-sponsoring H.Res.
              615 are Reps. Ackerman, Richard Burr (R-NC), Bob Filner (D-CA),
              Mark Foley (R-FL) and Butch Otter (R-ID).</P>
            <P> Resolutions 615 and 617 deal with Israel’s attempts to gain international
              legitimacy. The latter, with 21 co-sponsors, expresses the House’s “support
              for the accession of Israel to the Organization for Economic Cooperation
              and Development (OECD).” Among other findings, it says that Israel
              shares the commitment to democratic government and the market economy
              that is the foundation of the OECD; Israel meets the OECD’s membership
              requirements; the U.S. should support and advocate the accession
              of Israel to the OECD; and “given the discriminatory policies against
              Israel in other international fora, Israel, upon accession to the
              OECD, should be afforded all the rights and privileges granted
              to all other member countries.”</P>
            <P> H.Res. 615, with 26 co-sponsors, expresses the House’s support
              for “full membership of Israel in the Western European and Others
              Group (WEOG) at the United Nations.” The bill says that the president
              should direct the U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. “to
              seek an immediate end to the inequality experienced by Israel in
              the U.N.”; U.S. interests “would be well served” if Israel were
              afforded the benefits of full membership in the WEOG; the secretary
              of state and others should pursue diplomatic efforts and take all
              necessary steps to ensure Israel’s WEOG membership; and the secretary
              of state should regularly report to Congress on the actions taken
              to effect Israel’s full WEOG membership.</P>
            <h2> <B>Anti-Semitism Draws Congressional Attention</b></h2>
            <P> <B> </b>H.Res. 616, with 15 co-sponsors, is one of several measures
              concerning allegations of acts of violence against or harassment
              of Jews in Europe and elsewhere. It condemns acts of anti-Semitism
              and calls on European Union countries to “take tougher and more
              unified measures” to fight anti-Semitic violence and intimidation
              throughout Europe. It also calls on the president to direct the
              U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. to work to pass a UNGA
              resolution condemning anti-Semitism, and it says combating acts
              of anti-Semitism worldwide should be a U.S. foreign policy priority.</P>
            <P> In the Senate, S. 2292 was introduced by Sen. George Voinovich
              (R-OH) on April 7, reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee
              on April 29, and passed unanimously by the full Senate on May 7.
              It directs the secretary of state to send Congress an annual report
              on acts of anti-Semitism around the world, and to include the information
              from this report in the State Department’s annual International
              Religious Freedom and Human Rights reports. When passed, the bill
              had 24 co-sponsors besides Voinovich: Sens. George Allen (R-VA),
              Evan Bayh (D-IN), Joe Biden (D-DE), Sam Brownback (R-KS), Saxby
              Chambliss (R-GA), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Norm Coleman (R-MN),
              Susan Collins (R-ME), Jon Corzine (D-NJ), Michael DeWine (R-OH),
              Chris Dodd (D-CT), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Richard Durbin (D-IL),
              Russ Feingold (D-WI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Peter Fitzgerald
              (R-IL), John Kerry (D-MA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Barbara Mikulski
              (D-MD), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Paul Sarbanes
              (D-MD), Gordon Smith (R-OR), and Ted Stevens (R-AK).</P>
            <P> However, H.R. 4230, introduced by Lantos on April 28, goes even
              further. It contains one truly outrageous “finding,” number 3,
              which says that “anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of vilification
              of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against
              Israel.” Furthermore, not only would it require annual reports
              on “acts
              of anti-Semitism in foreign countries” and governmental responses
              to such acts, but it would also “authorize and encourage the secretary
              of state to establish within the Department of State an Office
              to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism.” The bill has 26 co-sponsors
              in addition to Lantos: Reps. Ackerman, Berman, Sherrod Brown (D-OH),
              Burton, Cardoza, Filner, Frost, Scott Garrett (R-NJ), Alcee Hastings
              (D-FL), Joe Hoeffel (D-PA), Israel, Mark Kirk (R-IL), John Lewis
              (D-GA), Lowey, Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), McNulty, Jim Moran (D-VA),
              Ros-Lehtinen, Rothman, Max Sandlin (D-TX), Schakowsky, Chris VanHollen
              (D-MD), Waxman, Weiner, Wexler, and Albert Wynn (D-MD).</P>
            <h2> <B>Jews Displaced by 1948 War Also Get Attention</b></h2>
            <P> <B> </b>In another victory for American Jews, particularly a
              New York-based group called “Justice for Jews from Arab Countries,” Sen.
              Rick Santorum (R-PA) on March 29 introduced S.Res. 325 urging the
              president to make sure that, in considering resolutions that allude
              to Middle East refugees, the text should refer to the fact that
              multiple refugee populations have been caused by the Arab-Israeli
              conflict, and any explicit reference to Palestinian refugees should
              be matched by similar reference to Jewish refugees from Arab countries.
              The resolution also says that any comprehensive peace agreement
              should
              also “include redress for the rights of all refugees displaced
              from Arab countries.” Coleman is the resolution’s only co-sponsor.</P>
            <P> The milder bill, H.Con.Res. 311, expresses “the sense of Congress
              that the international community should recognize the plight of
              Jewish refugees from Arab countries and that the United Nations
              Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East
              should establish a program for resettling Palestinian refugees.” Introduced
              by Ros-Lehtinen last October and described in the January/February
              issue of the <I>Washington Report, </I>the bill now has 23 co-sponsors,
              including Ros-Lehtinen. The 17 not previously named are Reps. Robert
              Andrews (D-NJ), Bob Beauprez (R-CO), Cardoza, Crowley, JoAnn Davis,
              Deutsch, Foley, Barney Frank (D-MA), Frost, King, Major Owens (D-NY),
              Jim Ramstad (R-MN), Rangel, Saxton, Chris Smith, Waxman, and Wexler.</P>
            <h2> <B>President Imposes Limited Syrian Sanctions</b></h2>
            <P> <B> </b>Responding to congressional pressures, Bush on May 11
              implemented the Syria Accountability Act by imposing limited, and
              largely symbolic, economic sanctions on Syria. He banned all exports
              to Syria, but excepted food and medicine, aircraft parts and components,
              informational materials, telecommunications equipment, certain
              software and technology, and certain temporary exports and re-exports.
              The president also prohibited Syrian aircraft from flying to and
              from
              the U.S., but excepted diplomatic and humanitarian flights and
              emergencies, and overflights of U.S. territory. Finally, he authorized
              the Department of the Treasury to block the assets of certain Syrian
              persons or entities.</P>
            <P> It is important to note that diplomatic relations will not be
              cut or limited, no Syrian flights fly to the U.S., the exceptions
              to the export ban constitute a major portion of the $200 million
              or so of U.S. exports to Syria, and the $260 million or so of Syrian
              exports to the U.S. are not affected.</P>
            <h2> <B>House Passes Resolution Criticizing Iran’s Nuclear Program</b></h2>
            <P> <B> </b>As expected, the House passed H.Con.Res. 398, which was
              introduced by HIRC Chairman Henry Hyde (R-IL) on March 25. It expresses “the
              concern of Congress over Iran’s development of the means to produce
              nuclear weapons,” and was passed under “suspension of the rules” on
              May 6 (see the previous issue of this magazine for a full description
              of the resolution). Lantos demanded a roll call vote, no doubt
              so that AIPAC could take names, and the final tally was 376 for
              the
              resolution, three against, 14 answering “present,” and 40 not voting.
              Those voting no were Reps. John Conyers (D-MI), Dennis Kucinich
              (D-OH),
              and Ron Paul (R-TX). Those answering “present” were Reps. Michael
              Capuano (D-MA), Bob Filner (D-CA), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Barbara
              Lee (D-CA), Jim McDermott (D-WA), George Miller (D-CA), Alan Mollohan
              (D-WV), Nick Rahall (D-WV), Jose Serrano (D-NY), Pete Stark (D-CA),
              Maxine Waters (D-CA), Diane Watson (D-CA), and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA).</P>
            <P> Meanwhile, the two earlier resolutions described in previous
              issues of this magazine that express congressional concern over
              Iran’s “failure” to live up to its safeguards agreement with the
              International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continue to gain co-sponsors.</P>
            <P> In the House, H.Con.Res. 332, introduced by Rep. Curt Weldon
              (R-PA) last November, has gained 11 new co-sponsors beyond those
              previously named in this column and now has 230, including Weldon.
              New co-sponsors are Reps. Corrine Brown (D-FL), Cramer, Danny Davis
              (D-IL), Jim Davis (D-FL), Foley, Gil Gutnecht (R-MN), John Larson
              (D-CT), Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), Ike Skelton
              (D-MO), and Stupak.</P>
            <P> The Senate version, S.Con.Res. 81, introduced last November by
              Feinstein, has gained seven co-sponsors and now has 63, including
              Feinstein. New co-sponsors are Sens. Chambliss, DeWine, Daniel
              Inouye (D-HI), Kerry, John McCain (R-AZ), Olympia Snowe (R-ME),
              and Arlen
              Specter (R-PA).</P>
