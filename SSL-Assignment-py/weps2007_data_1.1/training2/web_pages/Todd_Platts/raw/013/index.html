<span class="text">     Rep.

H.R. 3522 would reduce current legal immigration numbers by eliminating the visa lottery program and virtually eliminating chain migration (with the exception of parents). Current legal immigration levels have grown from less than 300,000 in 1965 to around a million annually in recent years primarily because of "chain migration" resulting from provisions allowing immigrants to send for their adult relatives. Then each of those relatives can send for their and their spouse's adult relatives, creating a never-ending and ever-growing chain. The bi-partisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended doing away with the adult relative categories (begun only in the 1950s) in order to protect America’s most vulnerable workers from wage depression and job competition resulting from mass immigration.<br>  As well, H.R. 3522 would reduce the annual limit on refugees and eliminate the unskilled worker visa category.  H.R. 3522 contains much needed security reforms such as increased Border Patrol agents and INS inspectors, as well as screening and tracking of aliens in the U.S. This bill, in tackling many of the provisions necessary for an effective interior enforcement strategy and in reducing chain migration and eliminating the visa lottery would reduce the number of people entering the country legally as well as reducing the number who are likely to become illegal aliens.   </span><BR><BR></td></tr></table>

Congress is prohibited from restricting the category with numerical limits, labor certification requirements or other protections for American workers. This category is in addition to the number of Chileans who are permitted to come to the U.S. each year under our normal immigration laws. Finally, the agreements also prohibit Congress from placing any numerical limits, labor certification requirements or other protections for American workers on the issuance of L-1 visas to nationals of Chile. L-1 visas are available to \"intra-company transferees,\" or aliens who have been employed abroad for at least one year in the three years preceding application by a business that has subsidiaries or affiliates in the United States.

The Hayworth amendment would have prohibited any funding in the bill from being used to pay Social Security Administration (SSA) employees to administer any benefits that would not be payable but for a totalization agreement with Mexico. The effect of this would have been to prevent the U.S.-Mexico totalization agreement from taking effect -- at least during FY 2005 -- since SSA employees could not be paid for any work they do to determine or pay benefits under the agreement. The U.S.-Mexico totalization agreement would allow illegal aliens from Mexico to receive Social Security benefits for the time they have worked in the U.S., provided they have since left the country or earned legal status.

The Oxley amendment stripped from H.R. 5025 the language of the Culberson amendment that had been added during Appropriations committee consideration of H.R. 5025.  The Culberson amendment prohibited the Treasury Department from using any of the funding in the bill to publish, disseminate, authorize or enforce regulations that permit or allow financial institutions to accept the matricula consular ID card. The amendment was intended to send a clear message to the Treasury Department and to financial institutions that Mexican matricula consular ID card is neither a secure nor acceptable forms of ID. While it did not actually require Treasury to change the current regulations which permit financial institutions to accept consular ID cards, it made those regulations unenforceable.

H.R. 2359   would extend for five years the voluntary workplace employment eligibility authorization pilot programs created in 1996. This program is an important component of preventing illegal aliens from taking jobs from those who have the legal right to work in this country. H.R. 2359 passed the House Judiciary Committee by a vote of 18 to 8 before being brought up on the suspension calendar. Because it was brought up on the suspension calendar, no amendments were allowed to be offered to the bill and the bill needed a two-thirds majority in order to pass. Thus, even though a majority of Representatives voted in favor of H.R. 2359 <A HREF=http://clerkweb.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.exe?year=2003&rollnumber=570>(231-170)</A>, it failed because a two-thirds majority did not vote in favor of it.

H.R. 3052 is designed to withhold a steadily increasing percentage of highway apportionments from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2010 – from states that pass laws permitting the issuance of driver’s licenses or state identification cards to illegal aliens.  The practice of granting driver's licenses to illegal aliens serves as an incentive for more illegal immigration.  In addition, granting drivers licenses to illegal aliens poses a security risk because driver's licenses are gateway documents that allow the license holder to obtain other secure documents.</span><BR><BR></td></tr></table>

H.R. 687 would permit acceptance of foreign passports, regardless of whether the holder has permission to be in the country, as evidenced by a US-issued entrance stamp or visa. Thus, illegal aliens holding those foreign cards would not be able to use them to open an account at a bank regulated by the Treasury Department or to enter a federal building guarded by federal law enforcement authorities such as the U.S. Marshal Service, or to apply for any federally provided public benefit.</span><BR><BR></td></tr></table>

reinstatement of Section 245(i). That is an expired immigration provision that allows illegal aliens with qualified relatives or employers in the U.S. to pay a $1,000 fine, to apply for a green card in this country, and to be allowed to stay in this country without fear of deportation until their turn arrives for a green card years, and even decades, later. The illegal aliens also would not have to go through the usual security screening in U.S. embassies in their home countries. The lowest estimate from supporters of the bill was that some 200,000 illegal aliens would benefit. H RES 365 also included language that would have implemented some important visa-tracking regulations helpful to discouraging illegal immigration. But all of those provisions had already been passed previously in H.R. 3525, making the assistance to illegal aliens the sole purpose of the bill.<BR><BR> Rep. Platts was one of 137 Representatives who voted AGAINST the 245(i) amnesty.

The vote on the four-month extension represented a compromise of the White House push for a longer extension.  Even though the four month extension was better than a year-long or permanent extension, it still would have resulted in at least 200,000 more people being added to the country through illegal immigration.
