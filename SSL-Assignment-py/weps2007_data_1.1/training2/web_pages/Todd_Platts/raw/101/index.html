					<p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> This week, the Senate is expected to vote on a budget resolution that sets the framework for the tax and spending measures it will consider this year. Senators must vote NO against any resolution that contains the President's $726 billion tax cut and for amendments that significantly reduce it. It is outrageous to prioritize another round of tax breaks for millionaires while slashing billions of dollars in programs that ordinary Americans depend upon (including education and health care for the poor, elderly and children). In addition, it is shockingly irresponsible to consider a tax cut when the costs of a war with Iraq and its aftermath are not known. 
<P>The plan reported out by the Senate Budget Committee would result in hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade from the Social Security Trust Fund, health care, education and homeland defense being diverted to pay for tax cuts that would mainly benefit the wealthiest Americans. The President's proposed dividend tax cut has rightly been criticized for benefiting only the small percentage of Americans who receive substantial income from stock dividends. But the other large piece of the President's $726 billion tax cut package, accelerating the 2001 tax rate cuts, is even more skewed to the wealthy than the dividend tax cut. Over half of the benefits of accelerating the rate cuts would flow to the top one percent of tax filers, a group whose average income is about $1 million. The rate cuts alone, without the dividend tax cut, would give millionaires a new tax break of over $63,000 next year. </P>
<P>An estimated budget shortfall of $1.8 trillion could have been an $891 billion surplus, but for the Bush tax and budget proposals, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. It is beyond reason to run up huge deficits over the next decade - just as the baby boomers reach retirement age - to give another round of tax breaks to the very wealthy few. </P>
<P>The tax and budget plan approved by the House Budget Committee last week provides the clearest evidence to date that tax cuts for millionaires would be balanced on the backs of poor and middle-income families, and the Senate's plan is not much better. Under the House plan, $1.4 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade would be funded by cuts in important programs like Medicare ($214 billion in cuts), Medicaid ($95 billion in cuts), Food Stamps ($12 billion in cuts), veterans' programs ($15 billion) and farm programs ($7 billion). To make the tax cuts more politically palatable, the Senate budget does not specify such deep program cuts. But as the costs of the tax cuts inflate the national debt and drive up interest rates, the bill to be paid by future generations will be even higher. </P>
<P>The Senate voted on two Democratic amendments designed to reduce the cost of the President's tax cuts in the fiscal year (FY) 2004 budget resolution yesterday. Both were defeated in similar votes (one lost 42-57 and one lost 43-56). </P></p><p><b>ACTION NEEDED:</b> The House and Senate are expected to vote on their budget resolutions by Thursday evening. Contact both your senators and members of Congress TODAY and urge them to vote NO on any budget resolution that contains $726 billion in more tax cuts for the wealthy. 
<P>Call your senators and representatives and deliver the following message: </P>

<DIV align=left>"It is outrageous to prioritize another round of tax breaks for millionaires while slashing billions of dollars in programs that ordinary Americans depend upon (including education and health care for the poor, elderly and children). It is also shockingly irresponsible to consider a tax cut when the costs of a war with Iraq and its aftermath are not known. It is not only foolhardy, but morally indefensible to pursue tax cuts for the wealthy at this time of national crisis." </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV align=left>
<P><B>KEY TARGETS: </B></P>
<P>SENATE: An amendment to halve the cost of the tax cuts at $350 billion is likely to come up for a vote today. Sponsored by moderate Democrats and Republicans--Senators Baucus (D-MT), Breaux (D-LA), Voinovich (R-OH), and Snowe (R-ME)--halving the tax cut is a step in the right direction, but it is still unacceptable. At the end of the process, the most responsible course of action for Senators would be to vote against any budget resolution that still includes a large tax cut. </P>
<P>If their amendment to reduce the tax cut does fail, Voinovich, Snowe and Collins (R-ME) may instead vote for a budget resolution that has the President's $726 billion tax cut figure instead, in an effort to pass a budget resolution to avoid the appropriations process from becoming bogged down, as it was in fiscal year 2003. </P>
<P>Residents of MAINE and OHIO are urged to contact their Senators--specifically Voinovich, Snowe, and Collins--and urge them not use the failure of their amendment to limit the tax cut as an excuse to vote for the larger budget resolution. </P>
<P>HOUSE: Eleven House Republicans sent a letter on Friday to House Budget Chairman Nussle (R-IA) and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) saying they opposed a budget resolution that includes $726 billion in tax cuts and severe cuts in entitlement spending programs. The moderate Republicans who signed the letter include: Amo Houghton, Jack Quinn and Sue Kelly of New York; Mike Castle of Delaware; Nancy Johnson and Rob Simmons of Connecticut; Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri; Fred Upton of Michigan; Todd Platts of Pennsylvania; Steven LaTourette of Ohio and Ray LaHood of Illinois. </P>
<P>Only 12 moderate Republicans are needed to defeat the House budget resolution, if all Democrats remain united against the President's proposal. Below is the key list of moderate Republicans and Democrats that need to hear from their constituents. Contact them today and urge them to oppose the current House Budget resolution and any budget resolution that includes $726 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy. If your member has already expressed opposition (those with*), thank them for their support. </P>

					<p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on TANF reauthorization on Wednesday, March 12th. Although the witnesses were clearly there to promote the President's proposal, the Committee made clear that there is no support -- from either side of the aisle -- for the proposal. 
<P>The Bush plan would require states to put more welfare recipients to work, and it require that each person work more hours. It would tighten the definition of what counts as work; for instance, it would be harder to enroll in vocational education, and job search would not count at all. The president's proposal would also provide hundreds of millions of dollars to promote marriage and sexual abstinence. It did not offer any new child care money, though the administration now supports a modest increase in spending provided by the House. </P>
<P>Because the Senate failed to renew the program last year, and the 1996 law has been extended several times to keep the program operating, and is currently extended through June 30, 2003. </P>
<P>Even though Democrats no longer control the Senate, the makeup of the Finance Committee has not changed much since last year, and moderates in both parties are again voicing concerns.</P>
<P>Senator Olympia Snowe, (R-ME), argued at the hearing that her state's program allowing welfare recipients to go to college has produced results that are "beyond astonishing" and said that everyone on welfare should be given the same opportunity. Education, she said, is the only way to break the multigeneration cycle of poverty. Snowe said it would be "impossible" for states to put 70 percent of their welfare recipients into "work" for 40 hours per week, as the Bush plan directs, without "tremendous cost." </P>
<P>Senator John Breaux (D-LA) expressed opposition to the increase hours, saying that there is no reason to increase the work requirements now in law, arguing that the overall welfare program is not broken and does not need fixing. Current law requires each person to work 30 hours. </P>
<P>The committee chairman, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) expressed reservations about significant new requirements on the states, which have quietly complained about the stricter requirements.</P></p><p><b>ACTION NEEDED:</b> The Senate Finance committee is accepting public comment on TANF reauthorization. Individuals and groups are encouraged to submit written statements on TANF reauthorization. Statements must be received by March 26th (two weeks after the hearing).
