<p><a name="p2"></a><b>President George W. Bush<br/>
Hershey, Penn.<br/>
April 20, 2004</b></p>
<p class="click"><a href="#p5">Click here for section on Homeland Security</a></p><p><a name="p3"></a>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. Thanks for letting me
come. (Laughter.) It's good to be here in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
For a fellow who likes chocolate--(laughter)--this is a special
place. I know that Milton Hershey, who was one of the country's
great entrepreneurs, would be incredibly proud of the way this
community has prospered and grown. I bet he'd be especially proud
of the hospital that we saw coming in. The Senators with whom I was
traveling pointed out the fantastic hospital facilities. I'm told
that this is a community where people really care deeply about
their neighbors, and the quality of life in the community in which
they live. And so I want to thank the citizens from Hershey for
being so gracious and warm and setting such a good example.</p>
<p><a name="p4"></a>I want to thank the community leaders who are here from around
the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I appreciate your service
to our country. It's a tough job to serve at the local level.
(Laughter.) When things go wrong, your name is right there in the
phone book. (Laughter.) But we share a common calling, and that's
public service, serving our nation. I want to thank you for doing
what you're doing. It's such an honor, isn't it, to serve the
people of our respective communities and our nation.</p>
<div class="issuebold_11">
<p><a name="p5"></a>And you and I know what our first responsibility is; the first
responsibility, whether it be Washington, D.C. or Washington
Township, is the safety of our citizens. That's a solemn duty we
have, to work together to make sure that our nation is as secure as
it can possibly be.</p>
<p><a name="p6"></a>The task, our mutual tasks, our joint obligation changed
dramatically on September the 11th, 2001. There's now an urgency to
our duty. We have a urgent duty to do everything we can to fulfill
our solemn obligation.</p>
<p><a name="p7"></a>There are people here in this world who still want to hurt us.
See, they can't stand America. They can't stand us because we love
certain things and we're not going to change. We love our freedom.
We love the fact that we can worship freely any way we see fit. We
love the fact that we can speak our minds freely. We love our free
political process. We love every aspect of freedom and we refuse to
change. These terrorists will not be stopped by their own
conscience; they don't have a conscience. But they will be stopped.
They will be stopped because our great nation is resolute abroad,
we're vigilant at home, and we are absolutely determined to
prevail.</p>
</div>
<p class="click"><a href="#p17">Click here for next section on Homeland Security</a></p><p><a name="p8"></a>I appreciate Donna's invitation and her introduction. She
handled it very well. (Laughter.) I want to thank Keith Hite, the
executive director, for having me here, as well. Keith, thank you
for your hospitality. I want to thank the boards of directors, the
trustees and the members of the Pennsylvania State Association of
Township Supervisors. I appreciate the first responders who are
here today. Thank you for your service.</p>
<p><a name="p9"></a>I've traveled in a small little limo from the airport with
Senators Specter and Santorum, two really fine United States
Senators from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I flew down from
Washington with Congressman Todd Platts and Congressman Bill
Shuster, from Pennsylvania. Thank you both for traveling with me. I
am grateful that Congressman Tim Holden has joined us today. Thank
you for being here, Congressman. I appreciate you coming.</p>
<p><a name="p10"></a>Attorney General Jerry Pappert is here with us. General, I
appreciate you being here today. Charlie Dent, a member of the
statehouse, is with us; Paul Semmel--actually, Dent is in the State
Senate, Semmel is in the statehouse. These are members of the
Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committees. These are
people in the state legislature with whom you work to make sure
that the state of Pennsylvania is properly prepared for anything
that may come along.</p>
<p><a name="p11"></a>I appreciate so very much the other state and local officials
who are here. Thanks for taking time to come. I appreciate Mike
Lutz, who is the President of the Fraternal Order of Police
Pennsylvania State Lodge, for being here. Mike, thank you for your
time, and thank you for coming.</p>
<p><a name="p12"></a>Two other people I want to mention before I get going.
(Laughter.) I had the honor of meeting Major Dick Winters. Dick
Winters is a World War II veteran. There's an HBO miniseries called
"The Band of Brothers." He led the platoon in World War II. I told
him when I got off the airplane, it was such an honor to meet him.
It's such a fine example that he and others have set for those
brave souls who now wear our nation's uniform. Major Winters, I'm
glad you're here. I also want to thank the other members of our
military who joined us today, as well. Thank you all for
coming.</p>
<p><a name="p13"></a>When I landed, I met a fellow at the airport named Patrick
Leonard. Where are you, Pat? Or there you are, sure. How quickly
they forget. You wondering why I mentioned Pat Leonard? I'll tell
you why. The strength of America is in the hearts and souls of our
citizens. That's our strength. Listen, people say, America is
strong because of our military. We got a strong military, and I
intend to keep it that way. They say America is strong because
we're the wealthiest nation. That's good, we need to keep it that
way. But the real reason we're strong is because of the hearts and
souls of American citizens. That's why we're strong.</p>
<p><a name="p14"></a>Pat Leonard volunteers. He takes time out of a busy life and a
family life to volunteer at the fire department. That's what he
does. He's a volunteer fireman--as a matter of fact, he is the
chief of the Hershey Volunteer Fire Company. He has been doing this
for 26 years. It's more than just volunteering for the fire
department, though, see. He also volunteers to mentor children by
being a coach at all kinds of different sports teams.</p>
<p><a name="p15"></a>The reason I bring up Pat--and I want to thank his mom and dad
for being here, by the way, and two brothers who happen to be
volunteer firemen--the reason I bring him up is because I want our
citizens to understand that if you really want to help America,
take time out of your life and help save a soul. And you can do it
all kinds of ways. You can mentor a child, you can help the
elderly, you can volunteer at the fire department, you can be a Boy
Scout or Girl Scout leader. There's all kinds of ways you can help.
I'll bet most of you are doing this already. You represent the true
strength of the country. We're a compassionate, decent nation, a
nation of people who are willing to love their neighbor just like
they'd like to be loved themselves.</p>
<p><a name="p16"></a>As we gather this afternoon, we're 140 miles away from
Shanksville, Pennsylvania. This is a place where many innocent
lives ended. Shanksville is also the place where American citizens
stood up to evil, charged their attackers and began the first
counter-offensive in the war on terror. Those passengers on Flight
93 showed that the spirit of America is strong and brave in the
face of danger. And this nation will always honor their memory.</p>
<div class="issuebold_1">
<div class="issuebold_11">
<p><a name="p17"></a>The best way to secure our homeland, the best way for us to do
our duty, is to stay on the offensive against the terrorist
network. We began the offense shortly after September the 11th.
We're carrying out a broad strategy, a worldwide strategy to bring
the killers to justice. The best way to secure America is to bring
them to justice before they hurt us again, which is precisely what
the United States of America will continue to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="click"><a href="#p30">Click here for next section on Homeland Security</a></p><p><a name="p18"></a>Two-thirds of known al Qaeda leaders have been captured or
killed. We're making progress. It's a different kind of war than
the war that Major Winters fought in. This is a war against people
who will hide in a cave; a war against people who hide in the
shadows of remote cities, or big cities, and then they strike and
they kill. And they kill innocent people. They have no--as I said,
they have no conscience, they have no sense of guilt. But they also
know we're on their trail. And they will find out there is no cave
or hole deep enough to hide from American justice.</p>
<p><a name="p19"></a>We must be determined in this, and we've got a lot of really
good people, a lot of good people on the move. We're also working
with nations from around the world, sharing intelligence, making it
clear that if you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the
terrorist.</p>
<div class="issuebold_1">
<div class="issuebold_13">
<p><a name="p20"></a>By the way, when the President of the United States says
something, he better mean it. And when I said to the world, if you
harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist, I meant
exactly what I said. And the Taliban found out. It wasn't all that
long ago that Afghanistan was a training center for al Qaeda
killers. It was a safe haven. It's a country, by the way, that was
run by a brutal dictatorship. The Taliban had a perverted view of
the world. They hated--they must have hated women. Women were given
no rights. Young girls did not go to school. There was a barbaric
regime. So not only did we uphold doctrine that said, if you harbor
a terrorist or train a terrorist or feed a terrorist, you're just
as guilty as the terrorist; but we liberated people, as well, in
Afghanistan. People are free in that country. Young girls now go to
school for the first time in their life, thanks to the incredible
compassion of the United States of America.</p>
<p><a name="p21"></a>There's another very important lesson about September the 11th
that we must never forget, and that is, we can no longer take
threats that may exist overseas for granted. In other words, when
the President and/or anybody else in authority sees a threat, we
must take it seriously. Now, that doesn't mean every threat must be
dealt with by military option, but every threat must be viewed as a
potential problem to America. See, September the 11th changed the
equation. It used to be that oceans would protect us, that we saw a
threat, we didn't have to worry about it because there was two vast
oceans. And we could pick and choose as to how we deal with the
threat. That changed on September the 11th.</p>
<div class="issuebold_25">
<p><a name="p22"></a>These are vital lessons for our citizens to understand what took
place. See, we saw a threat based upon intelligence in Iraq. The
intelligence said there's a threat. The very same intelligence
looked at by the United States Congress caused them to reach the
same conclusion. The United Nations Security Council looked at the
intelligence and said, Saddam is a threat. And so, for about the--I
can't remember how many times they said it, but they said, disarm.
See, you're a threat; disarm. There's a reason why a lot of people
made the conclusion. It was not only based upon intelligence, it
was based upon the fact that he hated America, that he's willing to
pay suiciders to go kill people in Israel, that he actually used
weapons of mass destruction on his own people. See, this is a guy
who used it before.</p>
<p><a name="p23"></a>And the equation changed after September the 11th. And so, you
see, I was in a position where I either took the word of a madman
or took the actions necessary to defend America. And, given that
choice, I will defend America every time.</p>
<p><a name="p24"></a>We will defeat the enemy there so we don't have to face them
here. And at the same time, we will work to see that Iraq is free.
And that's really important for our long-term security. See, free
nations are peaceful nations. Free nations are nations in which
people can find hope and a chance to raise their families, just the
way moms and dads want to raise their families here in America.
That's why we love freedom, and that's why we think freedom is such
an important part of a peaceful world.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="p25"></a>This is an historic mission, in my judgment. This is an historic
opportunity. I told the story, I think, at one of these endless
press conferences I had last week--(laughter)--where--I love them,
of course--where--(laughter)--where I had dinner with Prime
Minister Koizumi of Japan. And it was at that dinner that we were
talking about the situation in North Korea. And it dawned on me
during the course of the conversation with my friend that, if we
hadn't got it right after World War II, would I have been having
this conversation with the Prime Minister about a common threat we
share? And it probably wouldn't have. If we hadn't secured the
peace in a proper way after World War II, I don't think--maybe I'll
be wrong--but I don't think I would have been having the very kind
of conversation I was having with Prime Minister Koizumi. And it
dawned on me during that conversation, when we get it right in
Iraq, some American President will be sitting down with a
duly-elected official from Iraq talking about how to keep the peace
in that troubled part of the world. It's an historic
opportunity--(applause)--historic opportunity to spread democracy
and hope as an alternative to hatred and terror and violence for
export.</p>
<div class="issuebold_25">
<p><a name="p26"></a>And it's a difficult mission, it's tough work. It's incredibly
hard, as we have seen on our television screens the last couple of
weeks. There's a reason why. Freedom frightens people who are
terrorists. The worst thing that can happen to a society, if you're
a terrorist, is for the society to be free. And it scares them.
Remember, I told you they'll strike us because of our love for
freedom. Well, they strike out because a free society is emerging
in the heart of a region that is desperate for freedom and
democracy.</p>
<p><a name="p27"></a>And we're facing supporters of the outlaw cleric, remnants of
Saddam's regime that are still bitter that they don't have the
position to run the torture chambers and rape rooms, and get the
special privileges they've had for all these yeas. Of course,
there's foreign terrorists there, trying to prevent the rise of a
free government in the heart of the Middle East. They will fail.
They will fail. They will fail because they do not speak for the
vast majority of Iraqis who do not want to replace one tyrant with
another. They will fail because the will of our coalition is
strong. They will fail because America leads a coalition full of
the finest military men and women in the world.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p28"></a>Thousands of Pennsylvanians have given their service in the war
on terror, including more than 6,000 National Guard and Reserve
members on active duty today. I want to thank their families for
enduring the long deployments and separations and sacrifices. I
want to thank the men and women who wear the uniform. Our nation is
grateful for your sacrifice. We are grateful that you have
volunteered to make America a more secure country and the world a
more peaceful and free place.</p>
<div class="issuebold_13">
<p><a name="p29"></a>The enemy is still active. Think about Bali and Istanbul, or as
we saw in the murder of 200 citizens in Madrid. The terrorists use
violence to spread fear and disrupt elections. They want us to
panic. That's their intent. Their intent is to say, let's create
panic among the civilized world. They want nations to turn upon
each other, civilized nations to argue and debate about the
mission. You know, they're not going to shake our will. I'll say as
plainly as I can to them: You'll never shake the will of the United
States of America. We're not going to forget September the 11th. We
are determined, we are resolute, and we will bring you to
justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="issuebold_11">
<p><a name="p30"></a>And in the process, we've made some fundamental changes in the
way we defend ourself. We reorganized--or organized a new
Department of Homeland Security to protect the country. It was hard
work in the Senate. I want to thank Senator Specter and Senator
Santorum and the members of the House who are here. We had a big
debate about it, but it was the right thing to do. It was the right
thing to bring agencies involved with the protection of the
homeland under one umbrella agency, so we can better coordinate and
better communicate and better strategize as to how to protect the
homeland.</p>
<p><a name="p31"></a>And I picked a good man to run--become the first Secretary of
Homeland Security. Looks like I don't even have to say his name.
(Laughter.) You trained him well. (Laughter.) No, Ridge is doing a
great job. Since 2001, we've tripled funding for homeland security.
That's important. We've trained and deployed screeners at airports,
put thousands of air marshals on flights. We're now fingerprinting
visitors when they come to America, and compare the prints to those
of suspected terrorists and violent criminals. In other words,
we've made prevention of terror an important priority of our
government--just doing everything we can to make sure that we're as
safe as we possibly can be.</p>
<p><a name="p32"></a>The FBI now has the prevention of terrorist attacks as their
number one priority. They'll still chase down criminals and make a
case. But since we're at war, and since this is a big, free
country, the priority of the federal government is now the
prevention of another attack. And we're making sure they got the
resources necessary to do their job.</p>
<p><a name="p33"></a>We're standing behind our first responders. Since the moment our
country was attacks, our nation's police and firefighters and
emergency service personnel have played a critical role in the
defense of America against any threat of terror. They really have.
It was a--we saw the incredible bravery of the first responders in
New York City. I think it--I think those who are firefigthers and
police and emergency personnel gained a new degree of respect on
the streets of the cities throughout our country, when they
witnessed the great courage of their brothers who rushed into
collapsing buildings. We appreciate the fact that these men and
women understand they'll be on the front line against terror at any
moment, that they have accepted great responsibilities. And we have
responsibilities to you, as well.</p>
<p><a name="p34"></a>I've proposed an additional $3.6 billion for terrorism
preparedness grants. This is a way to help our first responders get
ready. The money needs to make sure we don't get it stuck in the
process, stuck from going from the federal government to the state
government to the local government. This money needs to get the
local communities in a timely fashion so you can put it to good
work.</p>
<p><a name="p35"></a>After September the 11th, we took another vital step to fight
terror, and that's what I want to talk about today. I want to talk
about the Patriot Act. It's a law that I signed into law. It's a
law that was overwhelmingly passed in the House and the Senate.
It's a law that is making America safer. It's an important piece of
legislation.</p>
<p><a name="p36"></a>First, before September the 11th, law enforcement, intelligence,
and national security officials were prevented by legal and
bureaucratic restrictions from sharing critical information with
each other, and with state and local police departments.</p>
<p><a name="p37"></a>We had--one group of the FBI knows something, but they couldn't
talk to the other group in the FBI--because of law and bureaucratic
interpretation. You cannot fight the war on terror unless all
bodies of your government at the federal, state, and local level
are capable of sharing intelligence on a real-time basis. We could
not get a complete picture of terrorist threats, therefore. People
had--different people had a piece of the puzzle, but because of
law, they couldn't get all the pieces in the same place. And so we
removed those barriers, removed the walls. You hear the talk about
the walls that separate certain aspects of government; they have
been removed by the Patriot Act. And now, law enforcement and
intelligence communities are working together to share information
to better prevent an attack on America.</p>
</div>
<p class="click"><a href="#p43">Click here for next section on Homeland Security</a></p><p><a name="p38"></a>And let me give you an interesting story. In late 2001, in
Portland, Oregon--and today, I was briefed on this story by
the--the federal prosecutor up there, in Oregon--or over there. I'm
used to Texas, still. (Laughter.) Everything was "up there."
(Laughter.)</p>
<p><a name="p39"></a>Police in Portland, Oregon turned up evidence about a local man
who was planning attacks on Jewish schools and synagogues, and on
American troops overseas. The initial information was passed to the
FBI and to intelligence services--quickly passed--who analyzed the
threat and took action. See, the Patriot Act allowed for
unprecedented cooperation. And because of the surveillance tools
enacted by the Patriot Act, the FBI learned that this guy was a
part of a seven-man terrorist cell. In other words, the Patriot Act
gave local--federal law enforcement officials, in this case--the
capacity to better understand the intelligence and to better
understand the nature of the terrorist cell. And now the cell has
been disrupted.</p>
<p><a name="p40"></a>I'll tell you another good thing that happened. Before September
the 11th, investigators had better tools to fight organized crime
than to fight international terrorism. That was the reality. For
years, law enforcement used so-called roving wire taps to
investigate organized crime. You see, what that meant is if you got
a wire tap by court order--and, by the way, everything you hear
about requires court order, requires there to be permission from a
FISA court, for example.</p>
<p><a name="p41"></a>So the crime boss, he'd be on the cell phone, maybe thinking
somebody is listening to him, would toss the cell phone and get on
another cell phone. And the law allowed for our drug busters to
follow the person making the calls, not just a single phone number.
So it made it more difficult for a drug lord to evade the net that
we were trying to throw on him to capture him with.</p>
<p><a name="p42"></a>We couldn't use roving wire taps for terrorists. In other words,
terrorists could switch phones and we couldn't follow them. The
Patriot Act changed that, and now we have the essential tool. See,
with court approval, we have long used roving wire taps to lock up
monsters--mobsters. Now we have a chance to lock up monsters,
terrorist monsters. (Laughter and applause.)</p>
<div class="issuebold_11">
<p><a name="p43"></a>The Patriot Act authorizes what are called delayed notification
search warrants. I'm not a lawyer, either. (Laughter.) These allow
law enforcement personnel, with court approval, to carry out a
lawful search without tipping off suspects and giving them a chance
to flee or destroy evidence. It is an important part of conducting
operations against organized groups.</p>
<p><a name="p44"></a>Before September the 11th, the standards for these kind of
warrants were different around the country. It made it hard to have
kind of a national strategy to chase down what might be a terrorist
group. The Patriot Act provided a clear national standard and now
allows these warrants to be used in terrorism cases. And they're an
important tool for those who are on the front line of using
necessary means, with court order, to find these terrorists before
they hurt us. Look, what I'm telling you is, is that the Patriot
Act made it easier for people we've tasked to protect America.
That's what we want. We want people to have the tools necessary to
do the job we expect them to do.</p>
<p><a name="p45"></a>Before September the 11th, law enforcement could more easily
obtain business and financial records of white-collar criminals
than of suspected terrorists. See, part of the way to make sure
that we catch terrorists is we chase money trails. And yet it was
easier to chase a money trail with a white-collar criminal than it
was a terrorist. The Patriot Act ended this double standard and it
made it easier for investigators to catch suspected terrorists by
following paper trails here in America.</p>
<p><a name="p46"></a>And finally, before September the 11th, federal judges could
often impose tougher prison terms on drug traffickers than they
could on terrorists. The Patriot Act strengthened the penalties for
crimes committed by terrorists, such as arsons, or attacks on power
plants and mass transit systems. In other words, we needed to
get--we needed to send the signal, at the very minimum, that our
laws are going to be tough on you. When we catch you, you've got a
problem, in America. See, that's part of prevention.</p>
<p><a name="p47"></a>I just outlined five reasons why the Patriot Act made sense.
These are practical reasons. These are ways to give our law
enforcement officers the tools necessary to do their job so that we
can better protect America. And we're making progress.</p>
<p><a name="p48"></a>The last two-and-a-half years, we've dismantled terrorist cells
in Oregon and New York and North Carolina and Virginia. We
prosecuted terrorist operatives and supportives in California,
Ohio, Texas and Florida. In other words, we're using these tools to
do the best we can possibly do to protect our fellow citizens.
We've frozen or seized about $200 million in terrorist assets
around the world. When I say "we," this is now not only United
States, but friends and allies. We're cutting off their money.
We're following--what was that movie?--follow the money. That's
what we're doing, to make sure that we do our job.</p>
<p><a name="p49"></a>I want you to keep in mind what I've just told you about the
Patriot Act the next time you hear somebody attacking the Patriot
Act. The Patriot Act defends our liberty. The Patriot Act makes it
able for those of us in positions of responsibility to defend the
liberty of the American people. It's essential law.</p>
<p><a name="p50"></a>The reason I bring it up is because many of the Patriot Act's
anti-terrorism tools are set to expire next year, including key
provisions that allow our intelligence and law enforcement agencies
to share information. In other words, Congress passed it and said,
well, maybe the war on terror won't go on very long, and,
therefore, these tools are set to expire. The problem is, the war
on terror continues. And yet some senators and congressmen not only
want to let the provisions expire, but they want to roll back some
of the act's permanent features. And it doesn't make any sense. We
can't return to the days of false hope. The terrorists declared war
on the United States of America. And the Congress must give law
enforcement all the tools necessary to protect the American
people.</p>
<p><a name="p51"></a>So I'm starting today to call on the United States Congress to
renew the Patriot Act and to make all of its provisions permanent.
And not only that, there are some additional things that Congress
should do--must do, in my judgment--to strengthen authorities and
penalties to defend our homeland. There's something called
administrative subpoenas--this is the authority to request certain
types of time-sensitive records without the delay of going through
a judge or a grand jury. These are critical for many types of
investigations. For example, today they're used for health care
fraud cases. In other words, those who investigate can use an
administrative subpoena to run down somebody cheating the health
care system. Yet, in terrorism cases, where speed is of the
essence, officials are barred from using administrative
subpoenas.</p>
<p><a name="p52"></a>That doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The American people
expect us to do our jobs. It seems like we ought to have the very
same tool necessary to run down a bad doc as to run down a
terrorist. And so when Congress considers the Patriot Act, they
ought to be thinking about ways to make sure that we've got the
capacity of catching terrorists.</p>
</div>
<p class="click"><a href="#p54">Click here for next section on Homeland Security</a></p><p><a name="p53"></a>People charged with certain crimes today, including some drug
offenses, are eligible for bail only in limited circumstances. But
terrorist-related crimes are not on that list. Think about what
that means. Suspected terrorists could be released, free to leave
the country, or worse, before their trial. And that doesn't make
any sense. The disparity makes no sense. If a dangerous drug dealer
can be held without bail, the Congress should allow the same
treatment for terrorists. If we want to protect our homeland, let's
make sure these good people have got the tools necessary to do
so.</p>
<p><a name="p54"></a>And there's another example I want to share with you. Under
existing law, the death penalty applies to many serious crimes that
result in death, including sexual abuse and certain drug-related
offenses. Some terrorist crimes that result in death do not quality
for capital punishment. That makes no sense to me. <span class="issuebold_11">We ought to be sending a strong signal: If you
sabotage a defense installation or nuclear facility in a way that
takes an innocent life, you ought to get the death penalty, the
federal death penalty.</span></p>
<div class="issuebold_11">
<p><a name="p55"></a>The reason why Congress must act is because we have a difficult
job protecting America. The reason why is because we're an open
society that values freedom. We stand for the--we're a beacon of
freedom and we say you can--our country is an open country. And yet
that makes us vulnerable--in itself, makes us vulnerable. We got a
lot of borders to protect. We got to be right a hundred percent of
the time, at the federal level and the state level and the local
level. We've got to be right a hundred percent of the time to
protect America, and the terrorists have only got to be right one
time--as 168 innocent men, women and children found out in Oklahoma
City. Different forms of terror. We've got to be vigilant against
terror at all costs.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="p56"></a>And there's only one path to safety and that's the path of
action. Congress must act with the Patriot Act. We must continue to
stay on the offense when it comes to chasing these killers down and
bringing them to justice--and we will. We've got to be strong and
resolute and determined. We will never show weakness in the face of
these people who have no soul, who have no conscience, who care
less about the life of a man or a woman or a child. We've got to do
everything we can here at home. And there's no doubt in my mind
that, with the Almighty's blessings and hard work, that we will
succeed in our mission.</p>
<p><a name="p57"></a>The reason I say that is because I have seen the spirit of this
country, I've seen the resolve of our nation. I know the nature of
the men and women who proudly call themselves Americans--people who
can rise to any challenge; people who are tough; people who are
determined; people who are resolute; and people, at the same time,
who are compassionate and decent and honorable. And it is my honor
to be the President of a country full of such people.</p>
<p><a name="p58"></a>May God bless your work. May God continue to bless our country.
Thank you all. (Applause.)</p>
