the day&#146;s final match. The match started with a pair of wins
from Messinger and Maritato. Messinger defeated Mike Seigal 4-0
at 149 while Maritato earned a 9-4 win at 157 to put the green

to go. The Bruins recaptured the lead with a pinfall win at
heavyweight which set the stage for Custer. Custer sealed the win
with a gutty 7-5 overtime win over Jason Flor. The teams would
