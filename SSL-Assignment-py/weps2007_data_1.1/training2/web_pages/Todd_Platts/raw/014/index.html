Secretary of homeland Security Tom Ridge was the keynote speaker at the 140th
anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.&nbsp; Even though inclement
weather called for the first ever Dedication Day speech to be delivered in the
Chapel at Gettysburg College, the event was still a success.</font></p>

received a warm and</font><font size="1">&nbsp; </font><font size="4">welcomed reception from the large audience at the Gettysburg College Chapel on
November 19.&nbsp; The newly elected Secretary to the Department of Homeland
Security, gave a inspirational speech about the sacrifice of the men 140 years
ago being no different than the sacrifice that our young men and women make
today for the cause of freedom.&nbsp; The members of the Lincoln Fellowship,
Gettysburg National Military Park, and the Civil War Institute are commended for
another well organized event.&nbsp; Thanks also to all who attended all the
events for Dedication Day including the Fortenbaugh Lecture and the Lincoln
Fellowship Luncheon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
