Workforce is set to consider H.R. 1, the reauthorization of the 
Elementary & Secondary Education Act (the federal umbrella law covering 
K-12 education) on Wednesday, May 2. 

As you know, we have been strongly supporting H.R. 490, legislation 
introduced by Elton Gallegly (CA-23) that would provide grants to states 
to support gifted and talented education.? Unfortunately, H.R. 490 is 
NOT included in H.R. 1. 

IF YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IS ON THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION (see list 
below), PLEASE CALL OR EMAIL HIM OR HER TODAY AND URGE THAT H.R. 490 BE ADDED 
TO H.R. 1 WHEN THE COMMITTEE MEETS. 

If your Representative is NOT a member of the Committee, please contact 
him/her and urge the Representative to cosponsor H.R. 490. 

All Representatives may be reached through the Capitol operator at 
202-225-3121, or visit www.house.gov for specific phone numbers and 
email addresses. 

Ask your Representative for a written response and be prepared to

1)   Summary of House and Senate bills is at:
http://www.nagc.org/Policy/quiksum2001gtact.htm

2)  No date yet scheduled for the Cochran Amendment to be heard in the Senate.

3)  H.R. 490 is still not being included in the education plan for the House. 
 (HR 1). Turn up the heat!   

If you or friends or family members are constituents or collegues of any of 
the House Education Members, call them immediately and urge their support for 
incorporating HR 490 into HR 1 (committee is listed at end of this message).  
We need more calls.  Spread the word. Calls from key supporters and those 
with name recognition would be very helpful!

Be sure to give your name and let them know that you are a constituent.

4)  If your US Representative is not a member of the House Education 
Committee, then please call your Representative and urge them to contact the 
committee members asking them to include HR 490 in HR 1.  

If your Rep. is not a current cosponsor, continue to seek their cosponsorship 
by finding other constituents to contact them. 

NOTE:   Even many of the current 63 House cosponsors of HR 490 don't realize 
that our bill is NOT in HR 1.   PLEASE Make sure that they know this and get 
them to rectify this error.  Our gifted kids are being left behind.   (The 
cosponsor list can be found at:   
http://www.nagc.org/Policy/2001cosponsors.htm )

UPDATE FROM NAGC May 4, 2001:
?
Good morning,
?
The Senate has begun consideration of S.1, the reauthorization of the 
Elementary & Secondary Education Act.? The Senate is expected to continue 
deliberations today, set the bill aside on Monday so that it can vote on the 
conference report on the budget agreement, and then resume consideration of 
S.1 late Monday or Tuesday morning.? Debate on S.1 is expected to last 
through next week.
?
My understanding is that Senator Cochran?s office has reached agreement with 
the White House on the contents of his amendment, which includes both the 
Javits Act program and the grants-to-states program introduced by Senator 
Grassley.? A specific day and time for a vote on the Cochran amendment has 
not been scheduled.? Please help us ensure that the Cochran amendment is 
added to S.1 by making calls or sending emails to the Senate.? Call 
202-224-3121 or visit <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/">http://www.senate.gov/</A> 
?
On May 2 the House Committee on Education and the Workforce began its 
consideration of H.R. 1, the House version of the Elementary & Secondary 
Education Act.? All reports are that the debate has been volatile, with 
members clashing over vouchers and the President?s proposal to test all 
students in grades 3-8.? The Committee did not complete debate on H.R. 1 
before the House adjourned for the weekend.? We are continuing to try to get 
H.R. 490, the grants-to-states legislation, added to H.R. 1, but we will need 
many more phone calls to committee members? offices if we are to prevail.? 
Please help us generate constituent calls to House committee members urging 
that H.R. 490 be added to H.R. 1. ?Call 202-225-3121 or visit <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/">
http://www.house.gov/</A>.    (see House Ed Committee List below)
?
Stay tuned!

NNFGC Update - 5/10/01

Javits was restored in the House Ed Committee, but they did NOT incorporate 
HR 490 (the grants-to-states gifted funding).  

Read more from Jane Clarenbach of NAGC:

Good Morning!? 

Yesterday, gifted and talented education advocates succeeded in restoring the 
Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act to H.R. 1, the 
reauthorization of the Elementary & Secondary Education Act (ESEA), in the 
House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

The Committee added the Javits research program to H.R. 1 by adopting a 
wide-ranging amendment offered by the Chairman, John Boehner of Ohio (OH-8).? 
The Committee then voted on May 9 to report H.R. 1 to the full House of 
Representatives for its consideration.? A vote on that legislation is not 
likely to occur for at least another 10 days.

Unfortunately, the grants-to-states legislation that would have provided 
federal funds for gifted education programs and services (H.R. 490) was not 
included as part of H.R. 1.? The lack of support for H.R. 490 in committee is 
due in part to concerns that the separate grants program was not consistent 
with the President?s strong support for block grant funding for K-12 
education programs.

NAGC will be consulting with the grants bill?s sponsor, Representative Elton 
Gallegly (CA-23) and other House supporters about possible ways to add H.R. 
490 to pending education legislation.
