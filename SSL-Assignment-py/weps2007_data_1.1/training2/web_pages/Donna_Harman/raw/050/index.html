<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small><i><b>Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi</b></i>: This
roundtable meeting, our fifth this month, is right on time, considering that the
&#145;topic of the day&#146; is the Hashemite succession and the stability of Jordan. We
invited Professor Asher Susser from the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University as an
expert on Jordan to speak today. I am delighted to welcome him once again to PASSIA. Dr.
Rosemary Hollis of the Middle East Program of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, London and I will serve as discussants. All of you are invited to raise questions
and ideas. </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>I would like to introduce this session by
saying that the Palestinian concerns during this transitional phase focus not only on
whether there is a crisis in Jordan or Israel, but also on the internal problems of today.
The Palestinians, are at a crossroads in terms of land, people, leadership, and rights,
which is why academics are invited to assess the decision makers and mobilize public
opinion, all in the name of doing what is best for the Palestinians. PASSIA has undertaken
a responsibility in this context, and continues to host meetings and publish their
proceedings, making more people aware of what is going on in the region that is of
importance to Palestine and the Palestinians.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Jordan has always been very important for
Palestinians. Unfortunately, while there are Israeli experts on Jordan, there are very few
Palestinian experts on the same topic. In fact, there are hardly any Palestinian experts
on anything nowadays, due to the fact that the burdens of occupation and an endless
transition phase have forced them to deal with so many different issues. It is for this
reason, amongst others, that PASSIA undertakes this initiative, hoping that through such
meetings, in addition to the other PASSIA projects, we can promote further understanding
of the issues that affect us all in one way. </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>Presentation</small></font></p></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Asher Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: It is rather hard
for me to talk about something that is still in the making. It reminds me of a story of a
person who came to Israel for a few days and was asked by his Israeli host, &quot;How long
did you come for?&quot; &quot;Two days,&quot; replied the man. &quot;What did you come to
do?&quot; asked his host. &quot;I came to write a book,&quot; said the man. His host then
asked him what the book was going to be called, and the man answered, &quot;Israel
yesterday, today and tomorrow.&quot; We are dealing here with the immediate, and that is
never an easy task.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>First of all, I would like to share my
understanding of what has taken place and the reasons behind it, but whilst making it
clear that I do not believe that we will ever know all the reasons. Having done that, I
will then talk a little about the issue of succession in Jordan and explain why I think
that it has a very good chance of passing through this transition phase in a stable and
orderly fashion.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Until very recently, Crown Prince Hassan was,
as King Hussein himself used to say, &#145;the apple of his eye&#146;. This was clear in
early 1997, when King Hussein sacked Prime Minister Kabariti because of a clash with the
Crown Prince in one of the most humiliating public letters that I have ever seen the King
issue. One of Kabariti&#146;s arguments was &#150; and he made this known &#150; that he
regarded the King and no other as his <i>marja&#146;yyeh</i>, his source of authority,
which the King regarded as an insult to Crown Prince Hassan. Even as recently as in August
1998, the King issued a statement whilst abroad dismissing rumors of a replacement as
nonsense. It is not, therefore, a surprise that the removal of Crown Prince Hassan came as
a shock to many people in Jordan and elsewhere. I can assure you that as someone who has
followed Jordanian affairs for a very long time, I did not believe that this was going to
happen.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Why did this happen? I would base my analysis
entirely on the words of the King himself, either those spoken during his CNN interview or
those written in his letter to Crown Prince Hassan, rather than any kind of rumor. First,
the question of Hassan&#146;s wielding of authority during the King&#146;s absence was
clearly an issue, and my interpretation is that Crown Prince Hassan was aware of this.
There are those in Jordan and elsewhere who have been saying for years that perhaps Hassan
was simply not cut out to be a king, and I think that Hassan saw the last six months as an
opportunity to establish, or assert his authority and show that he could be a king in his
own right. He apparently did not consult the King as much as he was expected to,
especially on sensitive issues, such as the army and the whole question of the replacement
of the Chief of Staff. I do not believe that Hassan&#146;s intention was to undermine the
King, but this is probably how King Hussein understood it.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>The second factor is the rift concerning the
succession issue, which was initially not over Hassan&#146;s place, but over who would
follow Hassan: the King&#146;s son Hamza, or Hassan&#146;s own son, Rashid. Hassan
obviously preferred that he be followed by his own son, and the King made it clear in his
letter that his brother had repeatedly refused to commit himself to the agreement over the
succession until becoming king himself.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>The tension between the two families, all the
gossiping and backbiting and a subsequent deterioration in the relationship between the
two men have also been put forward as a reason for the King&#146;s decision.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Very recently, Hussein realized that his life
was coming to an end and that he had no choice but to make a quick and decisive decision,
taking into account, perhaps, all the above factors and also - and this comes from the
Arabic press; I personally do not know whether it is true or not - that the USA was
arguing that replacing Hassan would be the right thing to do because of his reputed
unsuitability. The decision, therefore, could not be delayed.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>When the decision was finally made, it had
the appropriate shock effect on the Jordanian public&#146;s sense of stable continuity.
The Jordanians were felt to have a great advantage in comparison to many other Arab states
as they &#145;knew&#146; who would be next, which was always a source of comfort. Even if
there were reservations about Hassan, he was a known, a person who was highly respected
for his intellect, his experience, and his international reputation and who, given the
chance, could one day prove to be a great king. After the initial shock, people seem to be
getting used to the idea that Abdallah will follow his father, and in this respect,
Hassan&#146;s graceful, if not majestic acceptance of his removal is of great importance.
I would not exclude the possibility that later, in the interest of the dynasty and Jordan,
Hassan will not only accept his fate, but in due course will help Abdallah.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Much has been said about Abdallah&#146;s
family origins and the fact that his mother was English. Quite honestly, I do not think
that this is of any consequence. Toni Gardener was indeed English, but she converted to
Islam before marrying King Hussein; therefore, Abdallah was born to two Moslem parents. We
are talking about a regime based on primogeniture, meaning that the origin of the wife is
not that crucial, and Hussein&#146;s standing was never affected because he married an
English woman. He then went on to marry an American wife, a Christian with only one Arab
parent, so if one wants to pick and choose, Hamza, the son of Hussein and Noor, does not
come from better parents than Abdallah.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Not only did King Hussein marry Toni
Gardener, but also when Abdallah was born he became Crown Prince and remained so until
1965, when Hassan reached the age of 18. The fact that Abdallah was passed over at the age
of three had nothing to do with his mother, but everything to do with the political
instability of that period. These were the days of considerable inter-Arab disputes. In
1960, for example, the Prime Minister had been killed along with tens of other people, and
the King believed that he had escaped death only by arriving late for a meeting. The King,
believing that his life was in danger, then set about the task of appointing an adult
heir.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Why is Abdallah preferred to Hamza? I do not
think it has anything to do with their mothers, but quite a bit to do with the fact that
Abdallah is 37 whereas Hamza is only 18. More importantly, Abdallah has excellent
connections in the army; he is a military man, a career officer, a general, a commander of
the special forces, and this is extremely important in a country where stability is the
backbone of the regime. Neither Hassan nor Hamza compares favorably with Abdallah in terms
of their relationship with the security establishment.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>We know very little about Abdallah as a
political person. He has been out of the limelight for so many years, but it has been said
that as far as his character goes, he is very much like his father in terms of his
intelligence and his personal charm. Nevertheless, he lacks political experience.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>The major part of my analysis is that
Jordan&#146;s stability should not be attributed solely to the king&#146;s personality,
though his personality, political activism and various talents are obviously of great
importance. Jordan has been blessed with two great kings, Abdallah and Hussein, and their
contribution to the making of a stable Jordan is obviously very significant. Having said
that, Jordan is not a one-man show. I say this with a measure of conviction, very much as
a consequence of a book I wrote years ago, <i>The Political Biography of Wasfi At-Tal</i>.
At-Tal was perhaps Jordan&#146;s greatest Prime Minister. In writing this biography, what
struck me all along was the crucial importance of the people next to the King, those who
help him in managing the state. A lot of the analysis about Jordan and its future is based
on looking at the country as if it were a one-man show, as if everything rests on the
personality of the King. King Hussein is one of the greatest leaders in the Middle East
and one of the greatest leaders in the world, but when he came to the throne in 1953,
still not 18 years old, he was dismissed by his contemporaries as a non-entity, and it
took him many years to earn the reputation that he enjoys today. Worthy of mention in this
respect is that when the Iraqi Hashemites were overthrown in July 1958, Anthony Nutting,
the former British minister of state for foreign affairs, observed, &quot;However much one
may admire the courage of this lonely young king [Hussein], it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion [that] his days are numbered.&quot;</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>So there are other factors to bear in mind,
of which the three that follow are the most important:</small></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The cohesion of the political elite</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>,
  from the civilians, the military, and the ministers &#150; the dozens and dozens of people
  who are considered the King&#146;s men and who manage the country with him - is a crucial
  factor. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The loyalty of the armed forces and the
  security establishment</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>, which is very much a function of the more cohesive of the
  elite.</small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The external interest in Jordan&#146;s
  stability</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>; Jordan is much more important that its size, numbers, and economic and
  military power would suggest. Jordan is one of the most crucial components of the state
  structure of the region, being of great importance for the region - Israel, Saudi Arabia,
  Iraq, Syria - and also Europe and the USA. </small></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Between 1951 and 1953, there was no king,
Talal having been struck down with a mental illness, but even throughout this period when
the monarchy was weak, everything went very smoothly, despite predictions that Jordan was
going to be divided by its neighbors: by Iraq, which was still Hashemite, and by Syria and
Saudi Arabia together. The Iraqis did approach the Jordanians seeking unity, but their
offer was rejected. In short, the Jordanians were not, and are still not interested in
being taken over by the Palestinians, Iraqis, Syrians, or anyone else for that mater.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>If we look at the present situation, we can
see that there are many senior and experienced politicians in Jordan, in addition to the
family itself &#150; there are many princes today, unlike in Hussein&#146;s time - who are
capable of coaching Abdallah through the transition. Abdallah is not on his own, but
certainly, the main asset that he has is the loyalty of the armed forces, in addition to
the continuity of the external interest, which remains as great as it ever was.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>With regard to the country&#146;s domestic
security, it is unlikely that Jordan, the rule of which is characterized by cohesiveness
in the face of subversion, is facing any real threats.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>If any possible opponents exist, I would say
they are as follows:</small></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>Islamists</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: They are powerful, but they
  have traditionally adopted an extremely cautious attitude and believe that the monarch has
  religious legitimacy. I would be very surprised if they challenge the monarchy now. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>Palestinians</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: Their opposition rests
  on Black September, which happened 28 years ago. In spite of suspicions that the
  Palestinian Authority, the PLO and the Hashemite regime do not have the same political
  interests, the Palestinians in Jordan are happy to live as Jordanians, enjoy stability and
  their control over the economy, and have little interest in destabilizing it. They are not
  to be seen as a threat against the Hashemite regime.</small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>Power struggle within the elite</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: The
  worst case scenario would involve a power struggle breaking out within the elite and
  filtering down to the army. At present, this does not seem very likely, but were it to
  occur, no external friend would be able to overcome a domestic explosion in Jordan. The
  Jordanians are themselves their worst enemies. </small></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Jordan&#146;s real problems are not related
to the succession but are to be found elsewhere, such as in the fact that the economic
growth has fallen behind population growth. The Jordanians have a great interest in the
final status negotiations, and must be prepared to play their hand, bearing in mind that
the issues to be discussed &#150; Jerusalem, the refugees, borders, settlements, and
water, etc - are directly related to the Jordanians themselves. If Jordan goes through a
difficult transition, it will find it more difficult to deal with these issues, but I
believe that there is every chance that Jordan will pass through a smooth, stable
succession.</small></font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>Discussant I:</small></font></p></b>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Rosemary Hollis, Head of the Middle East
Program, Royal Institute of International Affairs, London</small></font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Rosemary Hollis</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I am rather
struck by the fact that the points brought up by Prof. Susser, the elements named as a key
to the stability of Jordan are the more traditional elements. We used to hear a lot about
Prince Hassan and the advantages that he could bring to the monarchy: his potential to
develop the economy, to restructure it and make Jordan a different sort of entity, his
intellectualism, his interfaith dialogues, how he was in the business of outreach and how
he was going to take Jordan into a new era. And yet, in reviewing the elements of
stability and potential challenges to them, Prof. Susser has put forward the idea that
there are some important, very old fashioned traditional bases of stability in Jordan,
such as the army, the continuity of the monarchy, and the King&#146;s men and the cohesion
amongst them.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>With regard to the role played by foreigners <i>vis-à-vis</i>
the stability of Jordan, this would appear to involve a lot of cash; Madeleine Albright
was almost indecent in her haste to fly to Jordan and give the Jordanians more money, and
I would not mind if the discussion explored the possibility that there is some truth to
the rumor that the Americans suggested to the King that he replace Hassan.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>When you [Prof. Susser] talked about the
weakness of Jordan in the economic sector, it did strike me that Jordan, with so few
natural resources and with such a difficult economy, would experience great difficulty in
improving it.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>I see the stability of Jordan as very much
the reinforcement of the patronage system, which would fit it with what you [Prof. Susser]
have said about the cohesion of the King&#146;s men and the fact that the cohesive elites
know where their interests lie. The biggest danger is if they suddenly throw that away,
which really does not suggest that there will be a radical restructuring of the political
economic system.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>The other thing that occurs to me is that if
the personality of the king is not that crucial, then it would not matter whether the King
was Hassan or Abdallah, and yet we were told that Prince Hassan has a problem in terms of
commanding the usual sources of respect, in terms of having the right chemistry with the
army. In a sense Prince Hassan has had it from all directions, having been suspected by
the Palestinians and by his own people.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>When I consider what has happened to Prince
Hassan over the last couple of weeks, it all seems extremely unfair. Apparently, King
Hussein had impossible expectations of his brother, because on the one hand he wanted him
to be his man, to do his work, to be his loyal brother, and yet, when the King was forced
to face his imminent death, Prince Hassan found himself in trouble for trying to reinforce
his own power base. Over the last two years, on visits to Jordan, I have heard some
members of the cohesive elite puzzle over what King Hussein himself was doing, and I have
heard them interpret the way Prince Hassan was handling certain crises as more
satisfactory. When the King announced that he was going to be absent for a long time, what
was Hassan supposed to do? Was he supposed to run the show or was he supposed to keep
running back and forth to the King? It seems to me that Prince Hassan got a &#145;bum
deal&#146;. Having said that, I am struck by the fact that the qualities that Prince
Abdallah will bring to the throne of Jordan do seem to reinforce the traditional elements
of stability in Jordan, as described by Prof. Susser. While Prince Hassan has the worst of
all worlds in some respects, Prince Abdallah has the best of all worlds, because he is
young, fresh, and unknown, yet at the same time represents the very elements of
continuity.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>Discussant II</small></font></p></b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi, Head of PASSIA,
Jerusalem</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>:</small></font></b><font face="Arial"><small> Why is it a
shock? I think because Prince Hassan was not a usual prince. The man established so many
things; in spite of the fact that for 34 years it was taken for granted that he was the
legitimate successor. He did his homework, he did his best, and he turned out to be unlike
any other prince in the region, sitting waiting for the throne to come to him. He
established a strong political address &#150; being next to the King in authority &#150;
and so many organizations, and he involved himself in so many activities; he is
intellectual, scientific, and he surrounded himself with educated people and trained them
in the Royal Court as the King&#146;s men and future ministers. People all over the world
referred to Crown Prince Hassan as the intellectual address in Jordan, and if you go to
Amman as a journalist, a professional or as a politician the only way you are going to
find out what is going on is to visit Crown Prince Hassan; nobody else can tell you what
you need to know on any subject but him. If the King had dismissed any other prince, it
would not be so much of a shock.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>There are several issues that I would like to
mention very briefly:</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<i><font face="Arial"><small>1. The relationship between King Hussein and
Crown Prince Hassan</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>There are two schools of thought. According
to one, the King never intended to allow Hassan to become king and used and manipulated
him until he felt the mission was accomplished and it was time to name another successor.
The second school of thought says no, on the contrary, the King has been supporting Crown
Prince Hassan and has endorsed his decisions, but recently, watching him rule and govern
as a <i>de facto</i> king, he saw some mistakes that he could not ignore, some of which
were mentioned very clearly in the King&#146;s letter.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>The King wrote that Hassan refused to form
the Royal Hashemite Council and to accept the King&#146;s decision as to who should follow
him [Hassan]. The other point was that Hassan crossed the red line with his intention to
clean two major institutions: the army and the diplomatic core, which are major pillars of
the state, and which the King will not allow anybody under any circumstances to mess with
without his consent. As for the third point, this has to do with personal relations.
According to one hypothetical scenario, the King replaced Hassan because he could not
accept all the rumors being spread about his wife and children and held Hassan partially
responsible for the bad feelings between the two families. According to the other
scenario, Prince Abdallah visited his father in the US and told him, &quot;I am 37 years
old, and I did exactly what you wanted me to do - I went to the army, prepared myself, got
married, settled down - and now when I look at the region I see that Qaddafi&#146;s son is
succeeding him, Hafez&#146;s son is succeeding him, all the Gulf leaders are preparing
their sons to follow them, so what about me? Am I not your son? Over the last six months
my uncle has given me nothing - no delegation, no authority, no mandate, nothing at all -
and I ask you: What future do I have as your son?&quot; On the other hand, however, Crown
Prince Hassan had always been loyal and obeying to his brother, the king, to whom he used
to refer as his father an whose word he used to accept as the law.</small></font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>2. The seven pillars of the Jordanian state: </small></font></p></i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Jordan is not a one-man show, and it has a
total of seven pillars. These are as follows:</small></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The Royal Palace: </small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>The Royal Palace has
  always been the King&#146;s house, and whether the King has been present or absent, Hassan
  was only one advisor amongst others who governed it. It is always the King&#146;s men who
  are present there, and all governments have to consult with these powerful advisors and
  consider their judgement and ideas. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The army</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: The Jordanian army was
  established before the emirate in 1921. It is the main establishment, or the King&#146;s
  tool to rule. It is the rehabilitation institute for tribes and Jordanians where their
  loyalty to the throne is strengthened. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The Bedouins</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: The Jordanian tribes
  have been partners with the King in ruling. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The government</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: The King always gave
  the government the necessary mandate, duties, responsibility, and chance to govern with
  his guidance. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The parliament</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: We have not been
  seeing a strong parliament, but is has been the address for legitimacy. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>The intelligence apparatus. </small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>A major
  institute to maintain security and stability. </small></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial"><small>Civil society</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: This has always been
  Crown Prince Hassan&#146;s forum: the institutions, the bankers, the businessmen, and the
  professionals. </small></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>When we compare Prince Abdallah and Crown
Prince Hassan with regard to their involvement in the seven pillars, we discover that
Crown Prince Hassan has not been governing the seven pillars in Jordan, although he
sometimes tried to put his men in the palace and government. Abdallah, on the other hand,
has the potential to govern the Royal Palace, the army, the Bedouins, and the
intelligence. Four major pillars out of seven are his, and I do not expect it will be long
before he is controlling the other three as well.</small></font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>3. The future of Abdallah:</small></font></p></i> 

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>I do not see anything frightening with regard
to the future of the new Crown Prince, Abdallah, since I see him governing the seven major
pillars of Jordan, assisted by two well-educated princes, Talal and Ghazi as well as his
uncle, Hassan.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<i><font face="Arial"><small>4. States in the region</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>We have seen Syria, Egypt, the Saudis and the
Gulf countries, in addition to the PNA, all sending congratulatory letters and trying to
open new chapters, especially the Saudis and the Gulf Countries. Even Egyptian President
Mubarak sent a cable of congratulations and his son to pass on his congratulations.</small></font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>5. Palestinians in Jordan:</small></font></p></i> 

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Especially over the last two years,
Palestinians have been asking questions, particularly with regard to the refugees, such as
&quot;What future do we have? If Arafat succeeds in building a Palestinian state, our
aspirations are there; meanwhile, we cannot afford to lose what we have established in
Jordan, we are Jordanians, and we would like to maintain our rights in Jordan under any
circumstances and are not willing to lose them because of the unknown battle of Arafat for
a Palestinian state or the unknown future of the state of Jordan.&quot; The Palestinians
in Jordan cannot antagonize the regime or the <i>mukhabarat</i> or become opponents to the
new change at the palace, thereby possibly losing their right to travel and open
factories, so they are going to keep quiet, and put their faith, for the time being
anyway, in the as yet unproven abilities of Prince Abdallah.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<i><font face="Arial"><small>6. Palestinians in the Occupied Territories</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>:
</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>For Palestinians in the Occupied Territories,
the matter is very serious, because for the last 34 years, the final status issues were
all carefully studied by Crown Prince Hassan, but now suddenly and without warning, he is
no longer there; all this information and analysis might vanish. Can we guarantee they
will be transferred to Abdallah and he will follow the same lines, or are we going to
start from zero point? One of the leaders of the Palestinian opposition told me last week,
&quot;If Arafat is smart enough, he will go immediately to Amman and say, &#145;On 4 May
1999, we will announce a Palestinian state and on 5 May 1999, we will declare a
confederation.&#146;&quot; I laughed and told him, &quot;The King is not interested; why
should he get involved in the Palestinian mess?&quot; Why should Arafat put all his eggs
in the unfamiliar Jordanian hand, realizing that we know very little about Abdallah or his
intentions? Who will be Abdallah&#146;s men and advisors, and what will be their agenda?
For the Palestinian leadership, it is a rather tricky situation. Things are somewhat
different with regard to the Palestinian elite and the Palestinian businessmen, as they
will see in this an opportunity to strengthen their ties with the Jordanians.</small></font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>7. The United States:</small></font></p></i> 

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Concerning the position of the United States,
its statement of support of the new change was addressed to the Jordanians only, telling
them we are here to back you, we are here for the stability of the regime, we are adding a
supplement to the Wye Memorandum, we have given you another $100 million and are prepared
to give you more to help the Jordanian economy. This is a very clear message, designed to
build trust and confidence amongst the Jordanians, who will believe that nothing bad will
happen for as long as they have the backing and support of the US. They know that without
a strong economy, there will not be stability in Jordan.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>European countries that have come to know
Crown Prince Hassan very well accepted him as a future king, but of course, they will have
to abide by the King&#146;s decision.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<i><font face="Arial"><small>8. The army and the political elite</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>I agree that they will not change their
loyalty. They consider the King&#146;s word to be the law.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<i><font face="Arial"><small>9. Israel</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>: </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Netanyahu called for a meeting with all the
security apparatuses to discuss the future of Jordan. One wonders, does he have a hidden
agenda for Abdallah, bearing in mind that he is not interested in seeing the transition
phase accomplished nor in Arafat as a partner and will refuse to recognize the Palestinian
state? Are we going back to the old Likud thesis, according to which the Palestinian home
is in Jordan? What if Netanyahu is re-elected; he is not a partner for peace? He is
dangerous, not according to my point of view, but also according to the point of view of
many Israeli circles, and the threat for Jordan and the Palestinians will continue to be
the right wing in Israel.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;</small></font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>Discussion</small></font></p></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></i><font face="Arial"><small>:</small></font></b><font face="Arial"><small> I will start with
Netanyahu and his hidden agenda. Those Israelis who said that Netanyahu is dangerous meant
he is dangerous for Israel. As for the Jordan-Palestine agenda, it is true that this was
the Likud agenda, but one has to put such issues in their historical perspective. The idea
of Jordan-Palestine is an old one that was connected with the idea of Greater Israel, the
idea that since all of Palestine is Eretz Israel, there will be no partition and thus,
Palestine is in Jordan. Whatever one might say about Netanyahu, what his government has
done, whether it wanted to or not, is to put an end to this idea. The whole logic of the
Likud has changed, so to go to the pre-peace formulas of the Likud and judge them out of
context is making a big mistake.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Sharon was the spokesman for Jordan-Palestine
yet today he is, I believe, the most favored interlocutor on the Jordanian side of the
river, simply because he has changed his mind about the whole thing and he delivers.
Israel has already withdrawn from some of the territory and committed itself to
withdrawing from other areas, so the whole idea of Greater Israel has gone out of the
window. Everybody knows that.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>What does make sense is the Israeli interest
in Jordanian stability, because Israel is about to enter final status negotiations with
the Palestinians. In fact, Israel has always been interested in Jordanian stability and it
is in Israel&#146;s interest for the Palestinians to establish a state that will not be a
threat to Israel or Jordan. Other players have hidden agendas: the Palestinians, for
example. As for the Iraqis praising Hussein&#146;s decision and then bringing up all the
stuff about Abdallah&#146;s mother, that is very typical of the Iraqi Government.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>What agenda does Arafat have? I agree with
Dr. Abdul Hadi that it is impossible for the Palestinians to keep quiet about the
refugees, but if they want to talk about the refugees who are Jordanian citizens, they
will face problems with the Jordanian Government.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Abdul Hadi:</small></font></i> </b><font face="Arial"><small>But we do not have a
Palestinian Likud saying &quot;this bank is ours and that bank is ours too.&quot;</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser:</small></font></i></b><font face="Arial"><small> Not at the moment, nor,
I hope, in the future. What you are saying, as I understand it, is that on the one hand,
the Palestinians, like others, have a hidden agenda, but on the other hand you are saying,
that there is no need for the Jordanians to suspect the Palestinians of having a hidden
agenda.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Abdul Hadi:</small></font></i> </b><font face="Arial"><small>Correct me if I am
wrong, but the secular Palestinian opposition from the PFLP, for example, as well as
Palestinian religious opposition. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are very interested today in the
idea of confederation with Jordan. Arafat, on the other hand, cannot go to Amman
empty-handed. For him Jordan after King Hussein is a new chapter; his starting point, for
all reasons, is to call for confederation now, a political cart in the face of Israelis, a
confidence cart for Palestinians in Jordan, and his own cart, before the new Jordanian
elite establish an anti-Palestinian position.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I don&#146;t know. I do
not believe that the Jordanians would accept the idea of a confederation without knowing
exactly what kind of Palestinian state is to be established. They will not commit
themselves to an unknown Palestinian entity. </small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>With regard to Dr. Hollis&#146;s viewpoint
concerning the unfairness of what has happened to Hassan, I agree completely. After all,
he has taken the King&#146;s place for the past six months and did, or so we all thought,
a good job. Why should he be punished for doing what he was asked to do? Well, perhaps he
was punished for the things that Dr. Hollis mentioned; for example, because he was going
to take Jordan to a new era, establish a new kind of political order, the sort of things
that perhaps many in Jordan were not really interested in.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>Maybe the Jordanian monarchy is a kind of
antiquated rule, but who are we to criticize? This is something for the Jordanians to
decide. In the Arab World, countries such as Iraq are desperate to create monarchies;
Saddam is desperate to have his own son succeed him, as is Assad, which means that as far
as the great revolutionaries of the 1950s and 1960s are concerned, the future lies in
monarchies.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Dr. Hollis</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I was not saying what a
pity that Jordan shouldn&#146;t become more of a democracy, but how interesting it is that
you made such a convincing case that the stability of Jordan depends on pillars that have
little to do with what the jargon about a modernized state.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser:</small></font></i> </b><font face="Arial"><small>I think that the
Jordanians, finding themselves having to choose between the jargon and Jordan, have chosen
Jordan. I would repeat that the personality of the king is not the only factor. Jordan did
have a king who was virtually unfit to govern but it did not make a difference; Jordan
survived, and he was replaced by Hussein. Hassan&#146;s chemistry with the army, or rather
his lack of chemistry, does, however, make a difference, because if the king has no
chemistry with the power structure, then there is a problem.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;</small></font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><small>General Discussion</small></font></p>
</b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Question: </small></font></i></b><font face="Arial"><small>What about the fact that
the will of the people &#150; democracy and real elections &#150; is missing from these
pillars. Could this contribute to the destabilization of Jordan?</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: With regard to the
elections, we cannot make comparisons with Scandinavian countries, only the neighboring
countries. In the past, Jordanians looked at Abdul Nasser as their savior, but in 1967
that changed, and today if they look at themselves, they find they are much better off
than their neighbors are. Jordan is a liberal, decent, stable fair regime, which sometimes
treats its opposition ruthlessly, but it is not like Iraq or Saudi Arabia and it is
unrealistic to expect Jordan to become a total democracy. If Palestinians in Jordan were
asked whether they would choose to live under the monarchy or under Arafat&#146;s
leadership, they would choose the monarchy.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Comment: </small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>We should also consider the
fact that<i> </i>King Hussein played a major role in moving the peace process forward and
that Abdallah still has a long way to go before he is able to play a similar role.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: It will take a long
time for Abdallah to become Hussein, and even then, he will not totally fill the space;
but there again, Hassan might not have been able to either. I am sure, however, that
Abdallah will work very hard to fill the gap.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Question</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: Why is it that it is only
now that we are hearing all these reasons why Hassan might not be a good successor?</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I cannot answer this
question. Analysts make mistakes all the time. I do not believe that the King did not want
Hassan from the beginning. Even Hassan was extremely surprised by the decision.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Question:</small></font></i> </b><font face="Arial"><small>How much influence did the
United States have on the King&#146;s decision, and could it be that Queen Noor was trying
to secure her power through her son Hamza?</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I am not a great
believer in conspiracy theories, but perhaps there is something to this; <i>Al-Watan
Al-Arabi</i> published something along that line. Many people spoke of Hassan&#146;s
unsuitability over the years, and perhaps the idea that Hassan was going to restructure
the country was the decisive factor.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Question</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: Why, I wonder, did the King
not name Abdallah his successor as soon as he sent the letter to Hassan?</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>

<b><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser</small></font></b></i><font face="Arial"><small>: I think that the King
knew what he was going to do when he came back but that, for various reasons &#150;
perhaps he was simply feeling too unwell &#150; he was unable to do things as quickly as
he wanted to, or chose to delay the announcement.</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Question</small></font></i></b><font face="Arial"><small>: How long is the monarchy
going to last? What role will Hassan play in the future?</small></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>

<i><font face="Arial"><small>Prof. Susser:</small></font></i> </b><font face="Arial"><small>I do not know. In 1958
when the Hashemite Monarchy was overthrown in Iraq, many people though that the days of
the King of Jordan were numbered, but the monarch is still very much there.</small></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><small>With regard to Hassan&#146;s role, he was
trying to introduce new patterns of political behavior in Jordan but that, perhaps, is
what cost him the throne. The Jordanian constitution has a place of prominence for
political parties, for free press, for free organizations, etc., and is a very liberal
constitution, but it is one that is undoubtedly based on the monarchy. Jordan&#146;s
monarchy will never democratize itself completely because the rules are set by the king
and any democratization goes from the top down. It is a question of achieving a balance.</small></font></p>
