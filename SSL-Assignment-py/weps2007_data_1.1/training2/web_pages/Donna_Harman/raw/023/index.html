<P>Donna Harman graduated from Cornell University with a degree
in electrical engineering, but has been involved with research
in new search engine techniques for many years. She currently
heads a group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
working in the area of natural language access to full text, both
in search and browsing modes. In 1992 she started the Text Retrieval
Conference (TREC), an ongoing forum that brings together researchers
from industry and academia to test their search engines against
a common corpus involving over a million documents, with appropriate
topics and relevance judgments.<BR>
