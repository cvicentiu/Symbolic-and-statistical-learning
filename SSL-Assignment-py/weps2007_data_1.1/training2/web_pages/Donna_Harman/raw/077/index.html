The workshop will explore evaluation methodologies for multilingual OCR 
systems.  By `multilingual' we mean to include systems that are capable 
of reading more than one language in the same document, as well as 
one-language-per-document systems that can be easily retargeted to new 
languages.  We hope to bring together researchers from many countries to 
discuss these and related topics: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>   What methodologies should be used to evaluate multilingual OCR 
       systems?  <BR>
	How do we compare accuracies across languages? 
<LI>  What ground-truthed data sets are now available in various languages? <BR>
       What kind of datasets need to be collected?  <BR>
       How is this to be achieved?  <BR> 
	What organizations might be willing to support such an the effort? 
<LI>  What multilingual OCR evaluation tools and error visualization 
       tools <BR>
       are available or should be developed? 
<LI>    What OCR evaluation methods and metrics 
        will be useful for OCR-based  <BR>
       machine translation and cross-language information retrieval? 
<LI> What kind of multilingual operating systems, editors, codesets,
     and environments are appropriate for OCR?
<LI> What is the market for multilingual OCR/IR technology?
<LI>   Open research problems, promising dissertation topics, etc.

<P>
This will be a one-day workshop for a maximum of 70 participants. 
Each participant will submit an extended abstract which will be distributed 
at the Workshop.  All participants are expected to contribute to the 
discussions. <BR>
   At the outset of the workshop, three volunteers will present brief, 
informal summaries of the <UL>
    <LI>methodologies,  
    <LI>corpora, and 
    <LI>tools mentioned in the submitted abstracts
</UL>.  Then we will split up into three
working groups, focused on these topics, and proceed to discuss key issues,
attempt to resolve questions, compile lists of resources, and draw up
recommendations.  Finally, in a plenary session, representatives of
each group will present their recommendations and invite general discussion.
There will be several opportunities for informal discussion and socializing.
<P>
After the workshop, the organizing committee will compile a Workshop 
Summary, based on the working group notes, and make it available on the Web.
It is hoped that the workshop will stimulate cooperative follow-on activities 
that will accelerate the pace of research in multilingual document image
analysis. <P>

The abstract should include the name, address, telephone, fax, and email 
address of the author(s).  It should ordinarily be limited to six printed

may be admitted in special cases, e.g. for catalogues of resources.
Accepted abstracts will be distributed at the Workshop and posted 
on the Workshop website.
