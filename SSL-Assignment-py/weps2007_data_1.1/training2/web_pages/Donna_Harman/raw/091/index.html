<A NAME="MultiKron"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>MultiKron Performance Instrumentation for MIMD Computers</H2></A>

<P>
  MultiKron is NIST's performance instrumentation chip for MIMD computers.  Its
  features have been incorporated into newer, high end commercial computers to
  assist designers in understanding machine bottlenecks. Recently, new MultiKron
  chips were successfully prototyped and SBus MultiKron toolkits were developed
  and released, allowing researchers to obtain hands-on experience with the
  chip without designing and building a hardware interface for their computer.

<P><A NAME="ATM"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Modeling and Performance Evaluation of ATM Network Protocols</H2></A>

<P>
NIST is participating in the development of protocols for Asynchronous Transfer
Mode (ATM) networks.  NIST uses its network simulation and formal modeling tools
to verify the completeness of protocols being developed by the ATM Forum and to
evaluate the performance of the protocols.  These protocols include traffic
management for the Available Bit Rate service, network routing and call control
for the private network-to-network interfaces.

<H2>Sensitivity Analysis Tool for Tuning Parallel Code</H2></A>

<P>
  S-Check, a new performance tool offering code-tuning information hitherto
  unavailable on parallel systems, has been released.  S-Check includes
  mathematically sound estimates of program sensitivities to code changes and
  to code interactions.  Unlike conventional means, S-Check's estimates
  accurately indicate where parallel code is best improved.

<P><A NAME="PADE"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Parallel Applications Development Environment</H2></A>

<P>
  The construction of parallel software applications for heterogenous virtual
  machines requires extensive bookkeeping that can distract the programmer from
  the real challenges of parallel algorithm development.  To simplify these
  tasks, researchers at NIST have produced the Parallel Applications
  Development Environment (PADE).  PADE provides an integrated framework for
  managing all phases of the development of applications based on the PVM
  message-passing library, including editing, file transfer, compilation,
  execution, and performance monitoring.  The package consists of an intuitive
  graphical user interface, a suite of PVM utilities, and documentation.

<P><A NAME="Sparse"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Portable and Adaptable High Performance Sparse Matrix Software</H2></A>

<P>
  NIST researchers are exploiting object-oriented data abstraction techniques
  to develop software for sparse matrix computations which achieve new levels
  of portability, adaptability and maintainability for scientific software.
  The packages released this year, IML++ (iterative methods library) and
  SparseLib++, both written in C++, have demonstrated both good performance and
  portability across a wide range of machine architectures.

<P><A NAME="GAMS"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Guide to Available Mathematical Software</H2></A>

<P>
  The Guide to Available Mathematical Software is a successful working example
  of a digital library of reusable mathematical software for computational
  science and engineering.  The system catalogs nearly 10,000 software
  components using a detailed tree-structured problem-oriented classification
  system.  The WWW service attracted more than 100,000 users in the last year.

<A NAME="Spoken"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Spoken Natural Language Interface to Library Catalogs</H2></A>

<P>
  A prototype system which allows a person to search for bibliographic ("card
  catalog") information in library systems using spoken natural language has
  been developed.  The project demonstrates feasibility of using such
  interfaces for information services without reliance on keyboards and menus,
  and serves as a testbed for exploring issues that arise in integrating large
  vocabulary continuous speech recognition and understanding into information
  technology systems.

<P><A NAME="Z39.50"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>New Modular Client/Server for Information Retrieval Via Z39.50</H2></A>

<P>
NIST has released Z39.50/PRISE, a public domain network-based indexing and
retrieval system.  The release contains (a) a basic UNIX client and server
which run over the Internet to support search and retrieval of information
accessible via the Z39.50 ANSI/NISO standard protocol, and (b) an indexer and
search engine (PRISE).  The server architecture isolates the search engine from
the details of the Z39.50 protocol thus minimizing the effort needed to
interface the server to natural language search engines other than PRISE.
Users input simple queries, such as a sentence or a phrase and retrieve lists
of records ranked in order of likely relevance.  Ranking is based on the
matches between the words the user inputs and the words in the text records or
documents, with appropriate statistical weighting.

<P><A NAME="Scan"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Segmenting Scanned Complex Scientific Documents</H2></A>

<P>
  A system to automatically segment scanned images of complex scientific and
  technical documents into text, mathematics, and graphics has been developed
  as an initial step in the process of converting paper archives into a digital
  library.  The primary segmentation uses connected components to form zones,
  which are then classified using OCR techniques. The system is being tested on
  the 23,000 pages of images in NIST Special Database 20.  This test sample was
  also prepared and released as part of the project.

<P>
  An Advanced Manufacturing Systems And Networking Testbed (AMSANT) for
  developing and demonstrating integration methods, performing remote testing
  with industry collaborators, and disseminating research information to US
  industry is now operational at NIST.  AMSANT establishes an open and unbiased
  experimental computing and communication facility for testing draft
  application protocols for data exchange standards and for the integration
  activities for computerized systems of various manufacturing industries.

<H2>Application Protocols for Process Plant Industries</H2></A>

<P>
  NIST is working with the process plant industries (e.g. pharmaceutical,
  chemical, power generation, engineering and construction) and related
  information technology vendors to develop, test, and demonstrate information
  exchange standards based on ISO 10303, commonly referred to as STEP, STandard
  for the Exchange of Product Model Data.  Collaboration with the PlantSTEP
  consortium, for example, has lead to the first such application protocol for
  the process plant industries, ISO 10303-227, now under review by TC184/SC4.

<H2>Algorithms and Software for Condensed Phase Quantum Chemistry</H2></A>

<P>
  A new version of the Generalized Atomic and Molecular Software System
  (GAMESS) has been developed that includes special algorithms for the
  inclusion of discrete and continuum solvent models.  GAMESS is a quantum
  chemistry software package distributed freely by Iowa State University.  The
  new version, developed in collaboration with NIST, incorporates
  recently-developed "effective fragment potential" methods for studying
  chemistry in the condensed phase.  This new capability, coupled to high-
  performance parallel computing technology, extends the applicability of
  quantum chemistry methods to more complex model systems.

<P><A NAME="Photoassociation"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Complete Photoassociation Spectrum of Ultracold Atoms</H2></A>

<P>
  Physicists at NIST are using the IBM SP2 to determine the photoassociation
  spectrum of ultracold sodium atoms in a laser trap.  The photoassociation
  spectrum contains information on the long-range interaction between atoms,
  which is needed to understand collision processes in atomic Bose-Einstein
  condensates.  The calculations required the determination of thousands of
  inner eigenvectors of a matrix of order 40,000.  The calculation also leads
  to a highly accurate value of the Na 3s-3p transition probability, supporting
  results of ab-initio calculations that presently disagree with experimental
  values inferred from lifetime measurements.

<P><A NAME="Condensates"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Structure of Atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates</H2></A>

<P>
  In mid 1995 several groups reported the observation of Bose-Einstein
  condensation in samples of ultracold trapped atoms.  This opens up
  possibilities for controlled production of macroscopic quantum states, with
  applications in quantum computing and the development of a coherent source of
  deBroglie radiation (the "atom laser").  Theoretical efforts at NIST, in
  collaboration with groups at Georgia Southern University and Oxford
  University, have developed techniques for computing the structure and
  excitation spectrum of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates using a nonlinear
  Schroedinger technique.  These have reproduced many observed features, and
  have provided guidance for new experiments.

<P><A NAME="Fluorescence"><HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Ab-initio Simulation of X-ray Fluorescence Spectra</H2></A>

<P>
  Detailed understanding of the electronic structures of materials must be
  inferred from various forms of spectroscopy. One of the most powerful
  experimental techniques is x-ray emission spectroscopy, which provides
  symmetry- and site-specific information on the density of electronic states.
  Working in collaboration with experimentalists at the Advanced Light Source
  (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory), NIST theorists are developing ab initio
  methods for modeling x-ray emission spectra of various systems.  Excellent
  agreement with experiment has been obtained for the first system studied in
  detail, graphite.
  Calculations involved search for an optimal basis spanning electron band
  states constructed from up to 3000 plane waves.  A reduced basis set of size
  60 enabled calculations to be performed with 100-fold speedup without loss of
  accuracy.  Since spectra are accumulations of very many spectral features,
  their summation could be efficiently formed using parallel computing.
