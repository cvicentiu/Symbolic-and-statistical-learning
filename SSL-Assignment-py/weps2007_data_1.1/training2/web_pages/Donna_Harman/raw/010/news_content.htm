<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Socrates once said: &quot;Be of good cheer about death 
and know this as a truth-that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life 
or after death.&quot; It is with that knowledge and the deepest of sorrows that we 
announce the death of a good man, Dann L. Drewry, a beloved husband, father, 
grandfather, and son, who, at the age of 55 passed away Friday, September 16, 
2005, following a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. <br>
<br>
As a youngster, Dann and his family traveled throughout the Texas Oil Patch, his 
father working for Mobil Oil, until they settled down in Alpine, Texas, where 
his father opened a White's Auto Store so the kids could stay put in one school 
for a change. Dann attended and graduated from Alpine High in 1967, where he was 
a member of the football and basketball teams and was very popular with all of 
his classmates. After high school Dann attended Sul Ross State University, later 
transferring to the University of Texas at El Paso where he obtained his 
Bachelor of Arts degree in Business in 1971. <br>
<br>
On March 12, 1971, Dann and Susan Whitfield were united in marriage at St. 
Paul's United Methodist Church in Las Cruces, New Mexico and from their union as 
husband and wife, two children, Michelle and Ryan were born. After college, Dann 
went to work for Whitfield Transportation, Inc. where he became a trusted and 
valuable protégé to his father-in-law, Hugh Whitfield; eventually succeeding Mr. 
Whitfield as the President of the Company in 1983, a position which he held 
until his death. Dann led the company to unprecedented growth, becoming a large 
regional commercial transportation and trucking business in the Southwest. <br>
<br>
Dann greatly loved the University of Texas at El Paso and its athletic programs. 
One of Dann's greatest pleasures was serving as a mentor to many of the programs 
student athletes. Dann Drewry was a great man, a kind and generous father, a 
caring and loving husband, and a great friend to many. He was a spiritual man 
who appreciated life. He loved automobiles, boats, and pretty much anything that 
had a motor in it: he enjoyed golfing, live music concerts and hunting, but he 
particularly loved his friends. Lincoln once said that the better part of one's 
life consists of his friendships and if that is true then Dann's life on this 
earth was indeed rich. For Dann following Ben Franklin's creed of speaking ill 
of no man and speaking all the good he knew of everybody-it is said that to have 
a friend you must be a friend and Dann was a friend to many and they to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dann is survived by his loving wife of 34 years, 
Susan Whitfield Drewry, their son, Ryan Drewry, daughter, Michelle Renee Lowery, 
son-in-law, Ace Lowrey and new granddaughter, Addison Danlee Lowery, all of El 
Paso, Texas; his parents, Betty and George Drewry, his brother, Ronnie Drewry 
and sister-in-law, Libby Drewry and Dann's nephew, Brandon Drewry, all of 
Alpine, Texas, and his Mother-in-Law, Fay B. Whitfield, of Las Cruces, New 
Mexico. Dann is also survived by many uncles, aunts and cousins and by many 
wonderful friends whom he loved and who loved him. Dann was preceded in death by 
his father-in-law and business mentor, Hugh Whitfield. <br>
<br>
A Funeral Service in celebration of Dann's life will be held at 2:00 P.M. 
Monday, September 19, 2005 at the First Baptist Church of El Paso, 805 Montana 
Avenue, El Paso, Tx., the Rev. Felicia Hopkins, Associate Pastor of St. Mark's 
United Methodist Church will be officiating. Interment will follow at Memory 
Gardens of the Valley, 4900 McNutt Road in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Pallbearers 
will be Lanny Golucke, Reese Lutich, Joel Brown, Bob Walker, Wayne Strachan, and 
Bill Skov of El Paso, Texas, and Marshall Meece and Steven Tredennick of Austin 
and Round Rock, Texas, respectively. Honorary Pallbearers are El Pasoans: Don 
Haskins, Robert Gray, Richard Lyon, Ted Moore, Dennis Neessen, Mack Rhoades, 
Roger Salome, Bob Stull, Terry Templeton, Pat Wieland, Larry Dorbandt of Las 
Cruces, New Mexico and Luster &quot;Pony&quot; Goodwin of Houston, Texas who serves as a 
representative of all of the players, past and present, of Dann's love for the 
University of Texas at El Paso's men's basketball program. <br>
<br>
In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made as a memorial in Dann's name to 
St. Mark's United Methodist Church or to your favorite charity. The family would 
like to thank all of the many doctors and nurses who worked so hard these past 
21 months providing conscientious and compassionate medical care to Dann and 
they would especially like to thank the &quot;prayer group&quot; and the &quot;food brigad&quot; 
composed of family and friends too numerous to mention individually, but who 
through their constant love, prayers, and support gave Dann and his family 
courage and strength, comfort and support, and now peace through this most 
difficult of times. &quot;Life lends us only feet, Death gives us wings.&quot; Fly, Fly, 
away dear friend, we long for the day that we will be together again in 
everlasting life, love, and peace. Services entrusted to Martin Funeral Home 
West, 128 North Resler, El Paso, Texas 79912. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>SUL ROSS' BAEZA REMEMBERED AS STUDENT ADVOCATE, ENTHUSIASTIC TEACHER&nbsp;<br>
</b><i>By Steve Lang, Director, News and Publications, Sul Ross State University</i><br>
<br>
When asked for impressions of Dr. Abelardo "Abe" Baeza, Sul Ross State University colleagues and students pointed to creative teaching, high energy and
widespread advocacy for students.<br>
<br>
Baeza, a member of the Sul Ross faculty since 1970 and an Alpine native, died at his home this Feb. 1, of an apparent heart attack. He was 59.<br>
<br>
Funeral services are scheduled Thursday, Feb. 5, 10 a.m. at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church, Alpine.<br>
<br>
"Dr. Baeza was known for the high quality of his classes. He taught his classes with a great deal of enthusiasm and excitement," said Dr. Dave Cockrum, vice president for Academic Affairs and a longtime friend and colleague.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"His classes were an adventure for the students. His classes were alive, creative events," he said. "When teaching a literature class he would arrange for the author to visit with the students either in person or via telephone or videoconference."<br>
<br>
This included such authors as Adolfo Anaya, Edward Albee and Judy Blume.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"His interest in Rudolfo Anaya grew to such an extent that he wrote two books related to Anaya and his works. In a children's literature class he would have the students write their own children's book and give awards for the best works."<br>
<br>
Anaya, contacted at his home in Albuquerque, N.M., said he and Baeza were in contact several times a month.<br>
<br>
"He would call me to check on my writing progress and update me on his," Anaya said. "He always said I had encouraged his writing.<br>
<br>
"You have lost a great, great teacher," said Anaya, who talked to Baeza's classes and read essays from his students.<br>
<br>
The noted author also cited other abilities that Baeza possessed.<br>
<br>
"I think he was on the way to more administrative work in the university [system]," he said. "Who knows, he might have been in line for a presidency. That's how highly I thought of him."<br>
<br>
Kathy Moreno, whose quest for a degree spanned four decades, remembered Baeza's encouragement and his praise.<br>
<br>
"Whenever he saw me, he told me, 'don't give up,' and when I got my degree this past December, he said, 'I'm really proud of you for your accomplishments,'" said Moreno, now a secretary in the Sul Ross Office of News and Publications.<br>
<br>
"He was a great advocate for students, and I remember when I was in his class in 1979, he made it so interesting you didn't want to miss," she said. "He made you, as a student, feel so important....He gave me that self-confidence and drive; he wanted his students to be hungry to learn."<br>
<br>
Baeza's classes frequently included visits by or teleconferences from noted literary figures, including writers Albee, Blume, Anaya and Richard Rodriguez, and Ernest Hemingway's son, Patrick.<br>
<br>
Baeza was born May 14, 1944 in Alpine and attended the Centennial School, then Alpine High School, graduating in 1963. He received his bachelor's (1967) and master's degrees (1970) in English and Spanish from Sul Ross, and his Ph.D. from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, in 1979. He was the first Hispanic Ph.D. to teach at Sul Ross.<br>
<br>
During his long tenure at Sul Ross, Baeza served in numerous capacities, including instructor, associate professor and professor of English and Spanish, Minority Affairs director. He received the Outstanding Teaching Award in 1997. Earlier in his career, he was twice nominated for the Piper Professor award presented by the Minnie Stevens Piper Association. In addition to teaching English and Spanish, he served as director of Title V and director of Mexican American Studies.<br>
<br>
A prolific writer, Baeza both wrote about and promoted Chicano/Chicana authors and literature. His first book, "Keep Blessing Us Ultima," serves as a reading guide for Anaya's memorable novel, "Bless Me, Ultima."<br>
<br>
"Abe and I often shared ideas about how to improve educational opportunity at Sul Ross," said President R. Vic Morgan. "He taught conversational Spanish courses for the faculty and staff and I enrolled in his courses on more than one occasion, always learning new things about the language and culture of this region and Mexico. We visited often about how to make Sul Ross a more accepting and inviting place for minority students.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"His passing will leave a void at Sul Ross that will be difficult to fill," he said. "His love for the university was evident to anyone who had a conversation with him that lasted more than a minute or two. He gave most of his life to Alpine and Sul Ross and there was never a doubt about his commitment to both. He will be missed by the University and Alpine communities."<br>
<br>
English professor Dr. Nelson Sager, Baeza's colleague for over 30 years, mourned his passing.<br>
<br>
"He was my friend and colleague and supported my career in ways that no one else did," said Sager.<br>
<br>
"There is a physical and emotional hole that won't be filled," he said. "It seems selfish in some ways to evaluate someone by what you no longer have and how much you miss him."&nbsp;<br>

Carolyn Nelon, 79, died Monday, October 8, 2001, in an Odessa hospital. &nbsp;A
memorial service was held on October 11 at the First Baptist Church in Alpine
where she had been a member since 1941.<br>
<br>
Carolyn was born April 5, 1922, in Del Rio, Texas, to Leo and Ruby Bishop.
&nbsp;She graduated from high school in San Augustine, Texas, where her father
was stationed as a Texas Ranger. &nbsp;She then attended and graduated from
cosmetology school in San Antonio. &nbsp;She moved to Alpine where she enrolled
at Sul Ross to obtain her &quot;Mrs. degree,&quot; &nbsp;and married Grady Nelon
in Alpine on March 15, 1942. &nbsp;After Grady was released from the Army Air
Corps at the end of WWII, they opened the Nelon Locker Plant in Alpine (where
the Thriftway warehouse now stands) and Carolyn &nbsp;helped run it for a short
time. &nbsp;While her two children were growing up, Carolyn was not only a
mother and a housewife, but also a beautician and part-time art student. &nbsp;She
was active in the American Legion Auxiliary and was a member of that group for
over 50 years. &nbsp;Instead of suffering from the &quot;empty nest

later earned two Master's degrees, in art and elementary education. &nbsp;She
was an accomplished artist and taught art at Alpine Elementary School and Alpine
